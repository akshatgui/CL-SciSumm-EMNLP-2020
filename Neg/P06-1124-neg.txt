 $$$$$ Define tuwk = 1 if yuk takes on value w, and tuwk = 0 otherwise.
 $$$$$ This is recursively applied until we need draws from the global mean distribution G0, which is easy since it is just uniform.
 $$$$$ For example, cu·k is the number of xul’s assigned the value of yuk, cuw· is the number of xul’s with value w, and tu·· is the current number of draws yuk from Gπ(u).
 $$$$$ This gives us an alternative representation of the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model that is amenable to efficient inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and easy computation of the predictive probabilities for test words.

The hyper parameters of our model are updated with the auxiliary variable technique (Teh, 2006a). $$$$$ We are thus interested in the equivalent posterior over seating arrangements instead: The most important quantities we need for language modelling are the predictive probabilities: what is the probability of a test word w after a context u?
