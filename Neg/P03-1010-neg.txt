The bilingual corpus used for our experiments was obtained from an automatically sentence aligned Japanese/English Yomiuri newspaper corpus consisting of 180K sentence pairs (refer to Table1) (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003). $$$$$ Alignments judged to be A or B were regarded as correct.

For example, Munteanu and Marcu (2005) apply the Lemur IR toolkit, Utiyama and Isahara (2003) use the BM25 similarity measure, and Fung and Cheung (2004) use cosine similarity. $$$$$ To do this, we have to sort all alignments according to some measures that determine their validity and extract highly ranked ones.
For example, Munteanu and Marcu (2005) apply the Lemur IR toolkit, Utiyama and Isahara (2003) use the BM25 similarity measure, and Fung and Cheung (2004) use cosine similarity. $$$$$ A large-scale Japanese-English parallel corpus is an invaluable resource in the study of natural language processing (NLP) such as machine translation and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).
For example, Munteanu and Marcu (2005) apply the Lemur IR toolkit, Utiyama and Isahara (2003) use the BM25 similarity measure, and Fung and Cheung (2004) use cosine similarity. $$$$$ We then use each of the English articles as a query and search for the most similar Japanese article in terms of BM25 and assume that it corresponds to the English article.

For example, Zhao and Vogel (2002), Utiyama and Isahara (2003), and Munteanu and Marcu (2005) all acquire their comparable corpora from a collection of news articles which are either downloaded from the Web or archived by LDC. $$$$$ The precision was 0.89.

Unlike other language pairs, the availability of Japanese-English parallel corpora is quite limited: the NTCIR patent corpus (Fujii et al, 2010) of 3 million sentence pairs (the latest NTCIR-8 version) for the patent domain and JENAAD corpus (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) of 150k sentence pairs for the news domain. $$$$$ This difference is also significant at 1% based on a one-sided proportional test.
