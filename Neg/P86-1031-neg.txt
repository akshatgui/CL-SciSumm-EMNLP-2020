This is the same sort of preference that is addressed by property-sharing constraint (Kameyama, 1986). $$$$$ It also accounts for a subset of what appears to be an effect of structural parallelism in anaphora interpretation.
This is the same sort of preference that is addressed by property-sharing constraint (Kameyama, 1986). $$$$$ These Cfs are given a default Cb order, that &quot;how much each center is expected to be the next Cb&quot;.

Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ If Rosa is still the Cb here, this utterance violates the basic Centering rule, so the rule predicts unacceptability, which is indeed the case following the sequence (2).n The same rule, however, provides no clue for the puzzling acceptability of the same extension following the sequence (3).
Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ The difference is that Sidner uses two immediate foci (Discourse Focus and Actor Focus) while centering uses only one (Cb) (see Grosz et. al.

In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context. $$$$$ 11Note that violating a discourse rule like (1) leads to more difficulty in understanding rather than clear-cut &quot;ungrammaticality&quot;.

In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context. $$$$$ This property is expressed along the dimension of the grammatical function SUBJECT for both Japanese and English discourses, where different pronominal forms are primarily used to realize the Cb.

Kameyama (1986) emphasized the importance of a property-sharing constraint. $$$$$ It indicates a close association between centering and the speaker's viewpoint, and sheds light on what underlies the effect of perception reports on pronoun resolution in general.
Kameyama (1986) emphasized the importance of a property-sharing constraint. $$$$$ It explains the problem cases for the basic Centering rule in Japanese and English.
Kameyama (1986) emphasized the importance of a property-sharing constraint. $$$$$ 13The importance of SUBJECT in centering is also discussed in Grosz et. al.

 $$$$$ I will then add another dimension called the &quot;speaker identification&quot; to the constraint to handle a group of special cases in Japanese discourse.

 $$$$$ Two significant implications of the proposed constraint have been discussed.
 $$$$$ Cb the entity an utterance centrally Its main role is to connect the current utterance to the preceding The term Center is used for the Cb.

There are two versions of the centering theory that have been applied to Japanese zero pronoun resolution $$$$$ Cb is the entity an utterance most centrally concerns.
