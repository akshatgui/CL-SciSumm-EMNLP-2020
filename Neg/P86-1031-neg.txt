This is the same sort of preference that is addressed by property-sharing constraint (Kameyama, 1986). $$$$$ Note that this default order alone does not determine interpretations of pronominal elements.
This is the same sort of preference that is addressed by property-sharing constraint (Kameyama, 1986). $$$$$ Rather, its role in the centering framework is to give an ordered list of referents (centers) so that commonsense inferences can be controlled.
This is the same sort of preference that is addressed by property-sharing constraint (Kameyama, 1986). $$$$$ My special thanks go to Barbara Grosz for her guidance and encouragement for the work from which this paper developed.
This is the same sort of preference that is addressed by property-sharing constraint (Kameyama, 1986). $$$$$ The latter is necessary for Japanese discourse where the primary Cb-realizer is the zero pronominal, but not for English discourse where it is the (unstressed) overt pronoun.

Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ Interpretations and acceptability judgements of the examples in this paper result from interviews withâ€¢ a number of native speakers in each language.
Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ It is assumed that an equivalent interpretation heuristic is used by a hearer.
Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ It indicates a close association between centering and the speaker's viewpoint, and sheds light on what underlies the effect of perception reports on pronoun resolution in general.
Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ This reconciliation of centering/focusing and parallelism is a major advantage of this constraint.

In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context. $$$$$ I have also greatly profited from discussions with Aravind Joshi and comments on an earlier version by N. Abe, M. Papalaskari, R. Rubinoff, J. Smudski, and
In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context. $$$$$ By its reference to the grammatical property SUBJECT, the constraint indicates that adjacent utterances of the same Cb cohere even better when there is a certain degree of grammatical parallelism.

In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context. $$$$$ Its main role is to connect the current utterance to the preceding one(s).4 The term the Center is also used for the Cb.

Kameyama (1986) emphasized the importance of a property-sharing constraint. $$$$$ The present property-sharing constraint highlights a grammatical aspect that contributes to local discourse coherence.
Kameyama (1986) emphasized the importance of a property-sharing constraint. $$$$$ Counterexamples to the constraint stated in (9) are cases with verbs of nonSUBJECT Ident I7&quot;Identification&quot; is a better term than &quot;empathy&quot; in conveying the lack of speaker's emotional involvement and, moreover, it was used in the original definition of empathy in (22).

 $$$$$ The unmarked Ident is the SUBJECT, but some verbs have nonSUBJECT Ident For instance, among giving/receiving verbs, ageru 'give' and morau 'receive' have SUBJECT 'dent while kureru 'give' has OBJECT2 Ident,I8 and for going/coming verbs, &a 'go' has SUBJECT Ident while kuru 'come' has nonSUBJECT Ident.
 $$$$$ This property has been identified in two dimensions.
 $$$$$ Sidner's (1981, 1983) immediate focus and potential foci in local focusing correspond to Cb and Cfs, respectively.

There are two versions of the centering theory that have been applied to Japanese zero pronoun resolution: Kameyama's (Kameyama, 1986) and Walker's (Walker et al, 1994). $$$$$ The latter in fact appeared in the above example as the nonpreferred reading of sequence (3) to (4), which is shown in (12): The following sequences in English are equivalent to those in Japanese (2) to (5): The evaluation of the third utterance parallels the Japanese example.
There are two versions of the centering theory that have been applied to Japanese zero pronoun resolution: Kameyama's (Kameyama, 1986) and Walker's (Walker et al, 1994). $$$$$ Crucially, one of the centers may be identified as &quot;backward-looking&quot; (Cb).
