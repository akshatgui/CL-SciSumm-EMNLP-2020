While previous work uses the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit to identify characters and extract typed dependencies for them, we found this approach to be too slow for the scale of our data (a total of 1.8 billion tokens); in particular, syntactic parsing, with cubic complexity in sentence length, and out-of-the-box co reference resolution (with thousands of potential antecedents) prove to be 3All categories are described using the Stanford typed dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but any syntactic formalism is equally applicable. $$$$$ Therefore, to increase the usability of the BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007b), which provides manually annotated data for information extraction in the biomedical domain and originally followed the Link Grammar scheme, Pyysalo et al. (2007a) developed a version of the corpus annotated with the SD scheme.

Bjorne et al. showed that deep dependency analyses in the well-established Stanford Dependency (SD) scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) can successfully be utilised in extracting graphs that express semantic entities as node sand relationship arguments as edges but are limited to one node per syntactic token. $$$$$ For such purposes, we argue that dependency schemes must follow a simple design and provide semantically contentful information, as well as offer an automatic procedure to extract the relations.

More recent approaches to compression introduce reordering and paraphrase operations (e.g. ,dencies (Briscoe, 2006) while there are over 50 Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ Thinking about this issue, we were struck by two facts.
More recent approaches to compression introduce reordering and paraphrase operations (e.g. ,dencies (Briscoe, 2006) while there are over 50 Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ For instance, in the sentence Behind their perimeter walls lie freshly laundered flowers, verdant grass still sparkling from the last shower, yew hedges in an ecstasy of precision clipping (BNC), the system will erroneously retrieve apposition relations between flowers and grass, as well as between flowers and hedges whereas these should be conj and relations.
More recent approaches to compression introduce reordering and paraphrase operations (e.g. ,dencies (Briscoe, 2006) while there are over 50 Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ In the example above, instead of having two relations adjunct(workout, of) and obj(of, Suns) as in PARC or ncmod(workout, of) and dobj(of, Suns) as in GR, SD provides a direct relation between the content words: prep of(workout, Suns).
More recent approaches to compression introduce reordering and paraphrase operations (e.g. ,dencies (Briscoe, 2006) while there are over 50 Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ When the relation between a head and its dependent can be identified more precisely, relations further down in the hierarchy are used, but when it is unclear, more generic dependencies are possible (DP1, DP4).

In this paper, we describe 1) a new dependency conversion (Section 3) of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, et al, 1993) along with the associated dependency label scheme, which is based upon the Stanford parser's popular scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), and a fast, accurate dependency parser with non-projectivity support (Section 4) and additional integrated semantic annotation modules for automatic preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation (Section 5). $$$$$ Finally, we address the question of the suitability of the Stanford scheme for parser evaluation.

By far the most prominent of these is the Stanford typed dependency scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ Their parser evaluation accommodates user needs: they used the collapsed version of the dependency graphs offered by the SD scheme, arguing that this is the kind of graph one would find most useful in an information extraction project.

We now describe how we build the syntactic relatedness trie (SRT) that forms the scaffolding for the probabilistic models needed to identify sentiment-bearing words via syntactic constraints extracted from a dependency parse (Kubler et al, 2009).

We also establish the applicability of the PropBank scheme to the clinical sub language with its many atypical characteristics, and finally, we find that the PropBank scheme is compatible with the Stanford Dependency scheme of de Marneffeand Manning (2008a; 2008b) in which the under lying tree bank is annotated. $$$$$ However if one believes in ultimately valuing extrinsic task-based evaluation, a dependency representation which proposes a suitable design for users and user tasks is probably the best surrogate for intrinsic evaluation.
