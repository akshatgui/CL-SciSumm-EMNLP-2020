Instead, we parse them into a default analysis, which can then be expanded and disambiguatcd at later stages of processing using a large semantic knowledge base (Richardson 1997, Richardson et al 1998). $$$$$ During a first pass, a version of MindNet that does not include WSD is constructed.

Others have automatically extracted attribute relations from dictionary definitions (Richardson et al, 1998), structured online sources such as Wikipedia info boxes, (Wu and Weld, 2007) and large-scale collections of high-quality tabular web data (Cafarella et al, 2008). $$$$$ Weighting schemes with similar goals are found in work by Braden-Harder (1993) and Bookman (1994).

The Mindnet is a general-purpose database of semantic information (Richardson et al 1998) that has been repurposed as the primary repository of translation information for MT applications. $$$$$ For example, if the relation watch—Means—gelescope were not in MindNet, it could be inferred by first finding the semrel paths between watch and telescope, examining those paths to see if another word appears in a Means relation with telescope, and then checking the similarity between that word and watch.

MindNet (Richardson et al, 1998) is both an extraction methodology and a lexical ontology different from a word net since it was created automatically from a dictionary and its structure is based on such resources. $$$$$ While many researchers have acknowledged the utility of labeled relations, they have been at times either unable (e.g., for lack of a sufficiently powerful parser) or unwilling (e.g., focused on purely statistical methods) to make the effort to obtain them.

 $$$$$ Outside the realm of NLP, we believe that automatic procedures such as MindNet's provide the only credible prospect for acquiring world knowledge on the scale needed to support common-sense reasoning.
 $$$$$ Statistics on that pass are given below: Besides our venture into additional English data, we fully intend to apply the same methodologies to text in other languages as well.

One early example was MindNet (Richardson et al, 1998), which was based on collecting 24 semantic role relations from MRDs such as the American Heritage Dictionary. $$$$$ However, none of these has succeeded in producing the breadth of semantic relations across entire dictionaries that has been produced for MindNet.

Richardson et al (1998) describes how MindNet began as a lexical knowledge base containing LF-like structures that were produced automatically from the definitions and example sentences in machine-readable dictionaries. $$$$$ For example, the semrel path between car and person in Figure 2 above is: car(--Tobj--drive—Tsub-->motorist—Hyp-->person.

Graphs also can be 69 generated from dictionaries, and used to produce knowledge bases (Richardson et al., 1998) or proximity information (Gaume et al, 2006). $$$$$ The automatic extraction of semantic relations (or semrels) from a definition or example sentence for MindNet produces a hierarchical structure of these relations, representing the entire definition or sentence from which they came.
