 $$$$$ As a lexical knowledge base constructed automatically from the definitions and example sentences in two machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), MindNet embodies several features that distinguish it from prior work with MRDs.
 $$$$$ The automatic extraction of semantic relations (or semrels) from a definition or example sentence for MindNet produces a hierarchical structure of these relations, representing the entire definition or sentence from which they came.
