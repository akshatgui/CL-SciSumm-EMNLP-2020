Our algorithm extends earlier approaches to morphology induction by combining various induced information sources: the semantic relatedness of the affixed forms usinga Latent Semantic Analysis approach to corpus based semantics (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), affix frequency, syntactic context, and transitive closure. $$$$$ Previous morphology induction approaches (Goldsmith, 1997, 2000; Mean, 1998; Gaussier, 1999) have focused on inflectional languages and have used statistics of hypothesized stems and affixes to choose which affixes to consider legitimate.

Most of the existing algorithms described focus on approach falls into this category (expanding upon suffixing in inflectional languages (though our earlier approach (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000)), Jacquemin and Jean describe work on prefixes). $$$$$ Thus, in this paper, we show how to automatically induce morphological relationships between words.

In our earlier work, we (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) generated a list of N candidate suffixes and used this list to identify word pairs which share the same stem but conclude with distinct candidate suffixes. $$$$$ Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester, et al., 1990); Landauer, et at., 1998) is a technique which automatically identifies semantic information from a corpus.

Using this final lexicon, we can now seek for suffixes in a manner equivalent to what we had done before (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000). $$$$$ Goldsmith (1997) tries cutting each word in exactly one place based on probability and lengths of hypothesized stems and affixes.

In order to obtain semantic representations of each word, we apply our previous strategy (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)). $$$$$ Though our algorithm could be applied to any inflectional language, we here restrict it to English in order to perform evaluations against the human-labeled CELEX database (Baayen, et al., 1993).
