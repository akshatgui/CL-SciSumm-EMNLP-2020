Two of the fundamental components of a natural language communication are word sense discovery (Jones, 1986) and word sense disambiguation (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1993) give the following example: the pair (chapter, describes) does not appear in their corpus; however, chapter is similar to book, introduction, and section, which are paired with describes in the corpus.

Several efforts have been made to develop automatic WSD systems that can provide accurate sense tagging (Ide and Veronis, 1998), with a current emphasis on creating manually sense-tagged data for supervised training of statistical WSD systems, as evidenced by SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000) and SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001). $$$$$ The COBUILD project (Sinclair 1987) adopts this view of meaning by attempting to anchor dictionary senses in current usage by creating sense divisions on the basis of clusters of citations in a corpus.

Following Ide and Veronis (1998) we distinguish between data and knowledge-driven word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ Finally, if a lesson is to be learned from a review of the history of WSD, it is that research can be very myopic and, as a result, tends to revisit many of the same issues over time.

Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ On the other hand, the words similar to book are books, documentation, and manuals (see their Figure 1).
Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Ahlswede (1995) reports between 63.3% and 90.2% agreement among judges on his Ambiguity Questionnaire; when faced with on-line sense assignment in a large corpus, agreement among judges is far less, and in some cases worse than chance (see also Ahlswede [1992, 19931, Ahlswede and Lorand [19931).
Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1993), looking at a context of Â±50 words, indicate that while words closest to the target contribute most to disambiguation, they improved their results from 86% to 90% by expanding context from Â±6 (a typical span when only microcontext is considered) to Â±50 words around the target.

WSD is fundamental to natural language understanding and is a useful intermediate step for many other language processing tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ This proposal has the merit of being immediately usable, but in view of the types of problems cited in the previous section, systematic study of interlanguage relations will be required to determine its viability and generality.
