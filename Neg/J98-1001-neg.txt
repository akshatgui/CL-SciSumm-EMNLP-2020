Two of the fundamental components of a natural language communication are word sense discovery (Jones, 1986) and word sense disambiguation (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Therefore, all work on sense disambiguation relies on the context of the target word to provide information to be used for its disambiguation.
Two of the fundamental components of a natural language communication are word sense discovery (Jones, 1986) and word sense disambiguation (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Hearst indicates that an initial set of at least 10 occurrences is necessary for the procedure, and that 20 or 30 occurrences are necessary for high precision.

Ide and Veronis (1998) present a very concise survey of the history of ideas used in word sense disambiguation; for a recent survey of the state-of-the-art one can refer to (Navigli, 2009). $$$$$ This supports the claim that both local and topical context are required for disambiguation, and points to the increasingly accepted notion that different disambiguation methods are appropriate for different kinds of words.

Several types of information are useful for WSD (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Class-based models attempt to obtain the best estimates by combining observations of classes of words considered to belong to a common category.
Several types of information are useful for WSD (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Viegas, Mahesh, and Nirenburg (forthcoming) describe a similar approach to WSD undertaken in the context of their work on machine translation (see also Mahesh et al. [1997] and Mahesh, Nirenburg, and Beale [1997]).
Several types of information are useful for WSD (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Early corpus-based work, such as that of Weiss (1973) used this approach; spreading activation and dictionary-based approaches also do not usually differentiate context input on any basis other than occurrence in a window.

The NLP field has gone through a very long tradition of algorithms designed for solving this problem (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Therefore, all work on sense disambiguation relies on the context of the target word to provide information to be used for its disambiguation.
The NLP field has gone through a very long tradition of algorithms designed for solving this problem (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ In a sense, WSD work has come full circle, returning most recently to empirical methods and corpus-based analyses that characterize some of the earliest attempts to solve the problem.
The NLP field has gone through a very long tradition of algorithms designed for solving this problem (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Conversely, priming words that are in the thematic context (i.e., relations determined by the situation, scenario, or script such as plane-gate) do not facilitate the subjects' lexical decisions (see also Fischler [1977], Seidenberg et al. [1982], De Groot [1983], Lupker [19841).

Several efforts have been made to develop automatic WSD systems that can provide accurate sense tagging (Ide and Veronis, 1998), with a current emphasis on creating manually sense-tagged data for supervised training of statistical WSD systems, as evidenced by SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000) and SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001). $$$$$ This paper is an attempt to provide that context, at least in part, by bringing WSD into the perspective of the past 50 years of work on the topic.

Following Ide and Veronis (1998) we distinguish between data and knowledge-driven word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ Yarowsky (1993) determines various behaviors based on syntactic category; for example, that verbs derive more disambiguating information from their objects than from their subjects, adjectives derive almost all disambiguating information from the nouns they modify, and nouns are best disambiguated by directly adjacent adjectives or nouns.
Following Ide and Veronis (1998) we distinguish between data and knowledge-driven word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ Advances in technology enabled the creation and storage of corpora larger than had been previously possible, enabling the development of new models most often utilizing statistical methods.
Following Ide and Veronis (1998) we distinguish between data and knowledge-driven word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ Several years later, Patrick (1985) used Roget's to discriminate among verb senses, by examining semantic clusters formed by &quot;e-chains&quot; derived from the thesaurus (Bryan [1973, 1974]; see also Sedelow and Sedelow [1986]).

Historically, after work on WSD had overcome so called early doubts (Ide and Veronis, 1998) in the 1960s, it was applied to various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, information retrieval, content and grammatical analysis and text processing. $$$$$ A different sort of view, one more consistent with current linguistic theory, is required; here, we see the recent work using generative lexicons as providing at least a point of departure.
Historically, after work on WSD had overcome so called early doubts (Ide and Veronis, 1998) in the 1960s, it was applied to various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, information retrieval, content and grammatical analysis and text processing. $$$$$ Guthrie et al. (1991) demonstrate a typical use of this information: in addition to using the Lesk-based method of counting overlaps between definitions and contexts, they impose a correspondence of subject codes in an iterative process.

In general, following Ide and Veronis (1998) the various WSD approaches of the past can be divided into two types, i.e., data and knowledge-based approaches. $$$$$ Waltz and Pollack (1985) and Bookman (1987) hand-encode sets of semantic &quot;microfeatures,&quot; corresponding to fundamental semantic distinctions (animate/inanimate, edible/inedible, threatening/safe, etc.
In general, following Ide and Veronis (1998) the various WSD approaches of the past can be divided into two types, i.e., data and knowledge-based approaches. $$$$$ Recent WSD work has exploited topical context: Yarowsky (1992) uses a 100-word window, both to derive classes of related words and as context surrounding the polysemous target, in his experiments using Roget's Thesaurus (see Section 2.3.2).
In general, following Ide and Veronis (1998) the various WSD approaches of the past can be divided into two types, i.e., data and knowledge-based approaches. $$$$$ She also notices that verb selectional restrictions are an lished that semantic priming—a process in which the introduction of a certain concept will influence and facilitate the processing of subsequently introduced concepts that are semantically related—plays a role in disambiguation by humans (see, e.g., Meyer and Schvaneveldt [19711).

A great deal of research on WSD has been done over the past decade (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Their rules perform even better than Weiss's, achieving 92% accuracy for gross homographic sense distinctions.
A great deal of research on WSD has been done over the past decade (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ In the spirit of the times, such systems were almost always grounded in some theory of human language understanding that they attempted to model, and often involved the use of detailed knowledge about syntax and semantics to perform their task, which was exploited for WSD. in the late 1950s and were immediately applied to the problem of representing word meanings.2 Masterman (1962), working in the area of machine translation, used a semantic network to derive the representation of sentences in an interlingua comprised of fundamental language concepts; sense distinctions are implicitly made by choosing representations that reflect groups of closely related nodes in the network.
A great deal of research on WSD has been done over the past decade (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Local or &quot;micro&quot; context is generally considered to be some small window of words surrounding a word occurrence in a text or discourse, from a few words of context to the entire sentence in which the target word appears.

Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ The words cigarette and tobacco co-occur with ash only once, with the same frequency as words such as room, bubble, and house.
Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ For this reason, it is especially timely to assess the state of WSD and consider, in the context of its entire history, the next directions of research.
Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Yarowsky (1993, 1994a, 1994b) examines different windows of microcontext, including 1-contexts, k-contexts, and words pairs at offsets —1 and —2, —1 and +1, and +1 and +2, and sorts them using a log-likelihood ratio to find the most reliable evidence for disambiguation.

WSD is fundamental to natural language understanding and is a useful intermediate step for many other language processing tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ That is, for homographs with different parts of speech (e.g., play as a verb and noun), morphosyntactic disambiguation accomplishes sense disambiguation, and therefore (especially since the development of reliable part-of-speech taggers), WSD work has focused largely on distinguishing senses among homographs belonging to the same syntactic category.
WSD is fundamental to natural language understanding and is a useful intermediate step for many other language processing tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Ahlswede (1995) reports between 63.3% and 90.2% agreement among judges on his Ambiguity Questionnaire; when faced with on-line sense assignment in a large corpus, agreement among judges is far less, and in some cases worse than chance (see also Ahlswede [1992, 19931, Ahlswede and Lorand [19931).
WSD is fundamental to natural language understanding and is a useful intermediate step for many other language processing tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Within these fields, work on WSD continued, most notably in the Harvard &quot;disambiguation project&quot; for content analysis (Stone et al. 1966; Stone 1969), and also in the work of Iker (1974, 1975), Choueka and Dreizin (1976) and Choueka and Goldberg (1979).

Following Ide and Veronis (1998) we can distinguish between data and knowledge-driven word sense disambiguation (WSD). $$$$$ Most disambiguation work uses the local context of a word occurrence as a primary information source for WSD.

In general, following Ide and Veronis (1998) the various WSD approaches of the past can be divided into two types, i.e., data and knowledge-based approaches. $$$$$ Since then, supervised learning from sense-tagged corpora has since been used by several researchers: Zernik (1990, 1991), Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992d, 1993), Bruce and Wiebe (1994), Miller et al.

In general, following Ide and Veronis (1998) the various WSD approaches of the past can be divided into two types, i.e., data and knowledge-based approaches. $$$$$ What is surprising is that in the broad sense, relatively little progress seems to have been made in nearly 50 years.

Ide and Veronis (1998) argue that word sense ambiguity is a central problem for many established HLT applications (for example Machine Translation, Information Extraction and Information Retrieval). $$$$$ As larger and more complete generative lexicons become available, there is merit to exploring this approach to sense assignment.

A review of methods for word sense disambiguation is presented by Ide and colleagues (Ideand Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ One of the obvious stumbling blocks in much recent WSD work is the rather narrow view of sense that comes hand-in-hand with the attempt to use sense distinctions in everyday dictionaries, which cannot, and are not intended to, represent meaning in context.
