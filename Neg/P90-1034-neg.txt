Hindle (1990) uses a mutual-information based metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large corpus to classify nouns. $$$$$ Some we recognize as synonyms in news reporting style: explosion - blast, bomb - device, tie - relation.
Hindle (1990) uses a mutual-information based metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large corpus to classify nouns. $$$$$ So for example, a car is an object that you can have and sell, like wine and beer, but you do not — in this sample (confirming what we know from the meanings of the words) -typically drink a car.
Hindle (1990) uses a mutual-information based metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large corpus to classify nouns. $$$$$ To capture this intuition, we turn, following Church and Hanks (1989), to &quot;mutual information&quot; (see Fano 1961).

NLP researchers have developed many algorithms for mining knowledge from text and the Web, including facts (Etzioni et al 2005), semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd 1997), concept lists (Lin and Pantel 2002), and word similarity lists (Hindle 1990). $$$$$ This basic idea of the distributional foundation of meaning is not new.

To extract semantic information of words such as synonyms and antonyms from corpora, previous research used syntactic structures (Hindle 1990, Hatzivassiloglou 1993 and Tokunaga 1995), response time to associate synonyms and antonyms in psychological experiments (Gross 1989), or extracting related words automatically from corpora (Grefensette 1994). $$$$$ There are of course many other objects that can be sold, but most of them are less alike than wine or beer because they can't also be drunk.

 $$$$$ Harris (1968) makes this &quot;distributional hypothesis&quot; central to his linguistic theory.
 $$$$$ In the subject-verb-object table, the root form of the head of phrases is recorded, and the deep subject and object are used when available.

 $$$$$ The idea is that, in ranking the importance of noun-verb associations, we are interested not in the raw frequency of cooccurrence of a predicate and argument, but in their frequency normalized by what we would expect.
 $$$$$ The second column in each table shows the number of instances that the noun appears in a predicate-argument pair (including verb environments not in the list in the fifth column).

The classifier for learning coordinate terms relies on the notion of distributional similarity, i.e., the idea that two words with similar meanings will be used in similar contexts (Hindle, 1990). $$$$$ For any of verb in the sample, we can ask what nouns it has as subjects or objects.

Our syntactic-relation-based thesaurus is based on the method proposed by Hindle (1990), although Hindle did not apply it to information retrieval. $$$$$ However, it is worth noting that the particular information about, for example, which nouns may be objects of a given verb, should not be discarded, and is in itself useful for analysis of text.
Our syntactic-relation-based thesaurus is based on the method proposed by Hindle (1990), although Hindle did not apply it to information retrieval. $$$$$ This demonstration has depended on: 1) the availability of relatively large text corpora; 2) the existence of parsing technology that, despite a large error rate, allows us to find the relevant syntactic relations in unrestricted text; and 3) (most important) the fact that the lexical relations involved in the distribution of words in syntactic structures are an extremely strong linguistic constraint.
