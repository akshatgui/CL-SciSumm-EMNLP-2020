Hindle (1990) uses a mutual-information based metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large corpus to classify nouns. $$$$$ Of course, not all nouns fall into such neat clusters: Table 6 shows a quite heterogeneous group of nouns similar to table, though even here the most similar word (floor) is plausible.

To extract semantic information of words such as synonyms and antonyms from corpora, previous research used syntactic structures (Hindle 1990, Hatzivassiloglou 1993 and Tokunaga 1995), response time to associate synonyms and antonyms in psychological experiments (Gross 1989), or extracting related words automatically from corpora (Grefensette 1994). $$$$$ This is a rather stringent definition; under this definition, boat and ship do not qualify because, while ship is the most similar to boat, the word most similar to ship is not boat but plane (boat is second).

Our method is similar to (Hindle, 1990), (Lin, 1998), and (Gasperin, 2001) in the use of dependency relationships as the word features. $$$$$ The verb drink is the key common factor.
Our method is similar to (Hindle, 1990), (Lin, 1998), and (Gasperin, 2001) in the use of dependency relationships as the word features. $$$$$ The reason is clear: section is semantically a rather empty word, and the selectional restrictions on its cooccurence depend primarily on its complement.

Hindle (1990) grouped nouns into thesaurus-like lists based on the similarity of their syntactic con texts. $$$$$ This demonstration has depended on: 1) the availability of relatively large text corpora; 2) the existence of parsing technology that, despite a large error rate, allows us to find the relevant syntactic relations in unrestricted text; and 3) (most important) the fact that the lexical relations involved in the distribution of words in syntactic structures are an extremely strong linguistic constraint.
Hindle (1990) grouped nouns into thesaurus-like lists based on the similarity of their syntactic con texts. $$$$$ For example, section is a general word that can refer to sections of all sorts of things.
