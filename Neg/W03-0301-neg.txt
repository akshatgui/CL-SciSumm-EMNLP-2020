 $$$$$ The shared task included Romanian-English and English-French sub-tasks, and drew the participation of seven teams from around the world.
 $$$$$ Annotators were not asked to assign a Sure or Probable label.

We use the data provided forthe French-English shared task of the 2003 HLTNAACL Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003). $$$$$ However, these come from parallel text that has been shallowly parsed via a method known as bilingual bracketing.

The evaluation is done using the performance measures described in (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003): precision, recall and F-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the Alignment Error Rate (AER), which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable. $$$$$ We are grateful to all the participants in the shared task, for their hard work and involvement in this evaluation exercise.

We evaluated the alignment performance of the proposed models with two tasks: Japanese English word alignment with the Basic Travel Expression Corpus (BTEC) (Takezawa et al, 2002) and French-English word alignment with the Hansard dataset (Hansards) from the 2003 NAACL shared task (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003). $$$$$ There are many people who contributed greatly to making this word alignment evaluation task possible.

As a point of comparison, the SMT community has been evaluating performance of word-alignment systems on an even smaller dataset of 447 pairs of non-overlapping sentences (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003). $$$$$ In particular, we would like to thank Dan Melamed for suggesting the two different subtasks (limited and unlimited resources), and Michael Carl and Phil Resnik for initiating interesting discussions regarding phrase-based evaluations.

To choose the regularization strength and the initial learning rate 0,3 we trained several models on a 10,000-sentence-pair subset of the French English Hansards, and chose values that minimized the alignment error rate, as evaluated on a 447 sentence set of manually created alignments (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003). $$$$$ Similarly, AER for English-French (5.71% highest error reduction) is clearly better than the AER for Romanian-English (28.86% highest error reduction).
