The evaluation was run with respect to precision, recall, F-measure, and alignment error rate (AER) considering sure and probable alignments but not NULL ones (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003). $$$$$ To make a cross-language comparison, we paid particular attention to the evaluation of the Sure alignments, since these were collected in a similar fashion (an agreement had to be achieved between two different annotators).
