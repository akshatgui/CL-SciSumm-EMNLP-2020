Although large amounts of unlabeled data are known to improve semi-supervised parsing (Suzuki et al, 2009), the best unsupervised systems use less data than is available for supervised training, relying on complex models instead: Headden et al's (2009) Extended Valence Grammar (EVG) combats data sparsity with smoothing alone, training on the same small subset of the tree-bank as the classic implementation of the DMV; Cohen and Smith (2009) use more complicated algorithms (variational EM and MBRdecoding) and stronger linguistic hints (tying related parts of speech and syntactically similar bilingual data). $$$$$ The main choice in the approach is the partitioning of f(x, y) into components r1(x, y) ... rk(x, y), which in our experience is straightforward.
