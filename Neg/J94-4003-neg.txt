We used two measurements, applicability and precision (Dagan and Itai 1994), to evaluate the performance of our method. $$$$$ Finally, our method was evaluated by simulating realistic machine translation lexicons, on randomly selected examples, and yielded high performance in two different broad domains (foreign news articles and a software manual).
We used two measurements, applicability and precision (Dagan and Itai 1994), to evaluate the performance of our method. $$$$$ The most reasonable assumption is to choose the tuple with the highest estimated probability, that is Tiâ€”the tuple with the largest observed frequency According to the model, the probability that T1 is the right choice is estimated as This criterion should be subject to the condition that the difference between the alternative probabilities is significant.

The idea of obtaining linguistic information about a text in one language by exploiting parallel or comparable texts in another language has been explored in the field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) since the early 90's, the most representative works being (Brown et al, 1991), (Gale et al, 1992), and (Dagan and Itai, 1994). $$$$$ This word has several translations, two of which are 'state' and 'position.'

Note that, unlike Dagan and Itai (1994), we give no consideration to statistical confidence as we are after 100% recall, whatever the cost to precision. $$$$$ This paper presents a new approach for resolving lexical ambiguities in one language using statistical data from a monolingual corpus of another language.
Note that, unlike Dagan and Itai (1994), we give no consideration to statistical confidence as we are after 100% recall, whatever the cost to precision. $$$$$ To facilitate further the mapping of syntactic relations and to avoid errors due to fine distinctions between them, we grouped related syntactic relations into a single &quot;general class&quot; and mapped this class to the target language.

It may, therefore, be desirable to apply a dynamic threshold on the discriminative ratio (cf. (Dagan and Itai, 1994)) to accept only those translation pairs with sufficiently high statistical confidence, for example. $$$$$ The use of these general classes, which was intended to facilitate the mapping of syntactic relations from one language to another, also facilitated our simulation method and caused it to produce realistic output.

For example, Dagan and Itai (1994) carried out WSD experiments using monolingual corpora, a bilingual lexicon and a parser for the source language. $$$$$ Since we did not have a Hebrew parser, we have simulated the two steps of determining the source syntactic tuples and mapping them to English by reversing the order of these steps, in the following way: First, the sample sentences were translated manually, as literally as possible, into English.
For example, Dagan and Itai (1994) carried out WSD experiments using monolingual corpora, a bilingual lexicon and a parser for the source language. $$$$$ The TWS' method still assumes that the source sentence to be translated is being parsed, in order to identify the words that are syntactically related to an ambiguous word.

The work of (Dagan and Itai, 1994) has also successfully used WSD to improve the accuracy of machine translation. $$$$$ For example, if /51 -= 0.51 and /52 = 0.49, the expected success rate in choosing T1 is approximately 0.5.

Dagan and Itai (1994) proposed an approach to WSD using monolingual corpora, a bilingual lexicon and a parser for the source language. $$$$$ We compare the precision of our method, which we term TWS (for Target Word Selection), with that of the Word Frequencies procedure, which always selects the most frequent target word.

The first method is based on a decision threshold (Dagan and Itai, 1994): the algorithm rejects decisions taken when the difference of the maximum likelihood among the competing senses is not big enough. $$$$$ The paper concentrates on the problem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable.
The first method is based on a decision threshold (Dagan and Itai, 1994): the algorithm rejects decisions taken when the difference of the maximum likelihood among the competing senses is not big enough. $$$$$ The presented algorithm identifies syntactic relations between words, using a source language parser, and maps the alternative interpretations of these relations to the target language, using a bilingual lexicon.
The first method is based on a decision threshold (Dagan and Itai, 1994): the algorithm rejects decisions taken when the difference of the maximum likelihood among the competing senses is not big enough. $$$$$ Hence, the results we report measure the performance of just the target word selection module and not the performance of a complete translation system.

As in (Dagan and Itai, 1994), we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence. $$$$$ For example (subjâ€”verb: man walk) is a syntactic tuple, which occurs in the sentence 'The man walked home.'
As in (Dagan and Itai, 1994), we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence. $$$$$ The identification of syntactic relations in the source sentence is available in any machine translation system that uses some form of syntactic parsing.
As in (Dagan and Itai, 1994), we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence. $$$$$ It thus demonstrates a possible trade-off between these two types of probabilities: using more informative statistics of the target language may compensate for the lack of translation probabilities.

(Dagan and Itai, 1994) explicitly suggests performing word sense disambiguation in the target language (English in the article) with the goal of resolving ambiguity in the source language (Hebrew). $$$$$ In the three experiments we reported, there were 61 cases in which the two types of information contradicted each other, favoring different target words.
(Dagan and Itai, 1994) explicitly suggests performing word sense disambiguation in the target language (English in the article) with the goal of resolving ambiguity in the source language (Hebrew). $$$$$ The meaning of this criterion is that only if we know with confidence of at least 1 â€” a that ln(pi /p2) > 0, will we select the most frequent tuple T1 as the appropriate one.
