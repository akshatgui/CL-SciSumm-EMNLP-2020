Note that, in order to transcribe the test data, we have trained a 20 Gaussian per state 39 MFCC Hidden Markov Model speech recognizer with HTK, using the training and development sets together with TIMIT (Fisher et al, 1986), the Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), and the Columbia Game Corpus (Hirschberg et al, 2005). $$$$$ The embedding relationships reflect changes in the ATTENTIONAL STATE, the dynamic record of the entities and attributes that are salient during a particular part of the discourse.

Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ IRI-90-09018, No.
Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ How best to measure inter-labeler reliability for discourse segmentation tasks, especially for hierarchical segmentation, is an open research question (Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Carletta, 1995; Flammia and Zue, 1995; Rotondo, 1984; Swerts, 1995).
Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ An important issue in applying the 1Â£ coefficient is how one calculates the expected agreement using prior distributions of categories.

Speech was found to improve inter-annotator agreement in discourse segmentation of monologues (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). $$$$$ We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship.
Speech was found to improve inter-annotator agreement in discourse segmentation of monologues (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). $$$$$ Passonneau and Litman (to appear) analyzed correlations of pause, as well as cue phrases and referential relations, with discourse structure; their segmenters were asked to identify speakers' communicative &quot;actions&quot;.
Speech was found to improve inter-annotator agreement in discourse segmentation of monologues (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). $$$$$ The relationship between intonational variation and discourse structure has been explored in a new corpus of direction-giving monologues.

Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ And speaking rate has been found to correlate with structural variation; in several studies (Lehiste, 1980; Brubaker, 1972; Butterworth, 1975) segment-initial utterances exhibited slower rates, and segment-final, faster rates.
Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ A better understanding of the role of intonation in conveying discourse structure will enable improvements in the naturalness of intonational variation in text-to-speech systems as well as in algorithms for recognizing discourse structure in speech-understanding systems.
Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ Results for each condition, together with the lowest and highest average n scores over the tasks, are presented in Table 3.
Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ Recent methods for automatic recognition of discourse structure from text have incorporated thesaurus-based and other information retrieval techniques to identify changes in topic (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Yarowsky, 1991; Iwanska et al., 1991; Hearst, 1994; Reynar, 1994).

A conservative way to combine segmentationsinto a gold standard is the Consensus (CNS) (or raw agreement) approach (Hir chberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ Amplitude was also found to increase at the start of a new topic and decrease at the end (Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy, 1980).

Discourse structure has been successfully used in non-interactive settings (e.g. understanding specific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), natural language generation (Hovy, 1993), essay scoring (Higgins et al, 2004) as well as in interactive settings (e.g. predictive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et al., 2001), generation/interpretation of anaphoric expressions (Allen et al, 2001), performance modeling (Rotaru and Litman, 2006)). $$$$$ Ongoing research is addressing the development of automatic classification algorithms for discourse boundary type; the role of prosody in conveying hierarchical relationships among discourse segments; individual speaker differences; and discourse segmentation methods that can be used by naive subjects.

In spontaneous monologue, Butterworth (1972) found that the beginning of a discourse segment exhibited slower speaking rate; Swerts (1995), and Passonneau and Litman (1997) found that pause length correlates with discourse segment boundaries; Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) found that the beginning of a discourse segment correlates with higher pitch. $$$$$ We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship.
