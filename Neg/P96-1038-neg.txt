We use AuToBI's models, which were trained on the spontaneous speech Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), to identify prosodic events in our corpus. $$$$$ We examined the following acoustic and prosodic features of SBEG, SCONT, and SF consensus-labeled phrases: f0 maximum and f0 average;6 rms (energy) maximum and rms average; speaking rate (measured in syllables per second); and duration of preceding and subsequent silent pauses.

Note that, in order to transcribe the test data, we have trained a 20 Gaussian per state 39 MFCC Hidden Markov Model speech recognizer with HTK, using the training and development sets together with TIMIT (Fisher et al, 1986), the Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), and the Columbia Game Corpus (Hirschberg et al, 2005). $$$$$ The relationship between intonational variation and discourse structure has been explored in a new corpus of direction-giving monologues.

Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ We examine the effects of speaking style (read versus spontaneous) and of discourse segmentation method (text-alone versus text-and-speech) on the nature of this relationship.

Speech was found to improve inter-annotator agreement in discourse segmentation of monologues (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). $$$$$ Thus, the tasks were designed to require increasing levels of planning complexity.

Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ In addition, the availability of speech in the text-and-speech labeling method led to significantly higher reliability scores.

A conservative way to combine segmentationsinto a gold standard is the Consensus (CNS) (or raw agreement) approach (Hir chberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ An intention-based theory of discourse was used in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992) to identify intonational correlates of discourse structure in news stories read by a professional speaker.

Discourse structure has been successfully used in non-interactive settings (e.g. understanding specific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), natural language generation (Hovy, 1993), essay scoring (Higgins et al, 2004) as well as in interactive settings (e.g. predictive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et al., 2001), generation/interpretation of anaphoric expressions (Allen et al, 2001), performance modeling (Rotaru and Litman, 2006)). $$$$$ Segment-medial and segment-final utterances are distinguished more clearly by rhythmic features, primarily pause.

In spontaneous monologue, Butterworth (1972) found that the beginning of a discourse segment exhibited slower speaking rate; Swerts (1995), and Passonneau and Litman (1997) found that pause length correlates with discourse segment boundaries; Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) found that the beginning of a discourse segment correlates with higher pitch. $$$$$ We concluded that this statistic did not serve, for example, to capture the differences observed between labelings from text alone versus labelings from text and speech.
