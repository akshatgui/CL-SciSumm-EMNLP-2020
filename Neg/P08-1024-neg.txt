 $$$$$ Results show that accounting for multiple derivations does indeed improve performance.
 $$$$$ Large-scale discriminative machine translation promises to further the state-of-the-art, but has failed to deliver convincing gains over current heuristic frequency count systems.
 $$$$$ In decoding we can search for the maximum probability derivation, which is the standard practice in SMT, or for the maximum probability translation which is what we actually want from our model, i.e. the best translation.
 $$$$$ However, while Chiang (2005) stores an abbreviated context composed of the n − 1 target words on the left and right edge of the target substring, here we store the entire target string.

Secondly, as (Blunsom et al, 2008) show, marginalizing out the different segmentations during decoding leads to improved performance. $$$$$ Results show that accounting for multiple derivations does indeed improve performance.

The version presented in (Blunsom et al., 2008) scales to more than a hundred thousand short training sentences, but does not integrate a language model and thus has performance that improves upon Hiero without a language model only. $$$$$ We argue that a principle reason for this failure is not dealing with multiple, equivalent translations.

Instead of using expected BLEU as a training objective, Blunsom et al (2008) trained their model to directly maximise the log-likelihood of the discriminative model, estimating feature expectations from a packed chart. $$$$$ An interesting counterpoint is the work of DeNero et al. (2006), who show that their unregularised model finds degenerate solutions.

This is almost certainly a side effect of the MERT training approach that was used to construct the models so as to maximise the performance of the model on its single best derivation, without regard to the shape of the rest of the distribution (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ A synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) consists of paired CFG rules with co-indexed nonterminals (Lewis II and Stearns, 1968).

In recent years, great research has shown the strength of latent variable models for natural language processing (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ We present a translation model which models derivations as a latent variable, in both training and decoding, and is fully discriminative and globally optimised.

We use the forest to train a log-linear model with a latent variable as describe in Blunsom et al (2008). $$$$$ Ideally, a model would account for this ambiguity by marginalising out the derivations, thus predicting the best translation rather than the best derivation.

Of ten, there are many derivations that are distinct yet produce the same translation. Blunsom et al (2008) present a latent variable model that describes the relationship between translation and derivation clearly. $$$$$ Therefore the resulting probabilities are only estimates.

(6) as max-derivation decoding, which are first termed by Blunsom et al (2008). $$$$$ To our knowledge no systems directly address Problem 1, instead choosing to ignore the problem by using one or a small handful of reference derivations in an n-best list (Liang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2007), or else making local independence assumptions which side-step the issue (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; Tillmann and Zhang, 2007; Wellington et al., 2006).

Blunsom et al (2008) first distinguish between max-derivation decoding and max-translation decoding explicitly. $$$$$ To do this we use our own implementation of Hiero (Chiang, 2007), with the same grammar but with the traditional generative feature set trained in a linear model with minimum BLEU training.
Blunsom et al (2008) first distinguish between max-derivation decoding and max-translation decoding explicitly. $$$$$ We argue that this is due to a number of inherent problems that discriminative models for SMT must address, in particular the problems of spurious ambiguity and degenerate solutions.

Both Mi et al (2008) and Blunsom et al (2008) use a translation hyper graph to represent search space. $$$$$ This is due to the many rules that enforce monotone ordering around sur la, (X) —* (X 1 sur, X 1 in) (X) —* (X 1 sur la X 2, X 1 in the X 2) etc.

For the first model, which includes the sparse parse features, we learn weights in order to optimize penalized conditional log likelihood (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ These limits were chosen as a compromise between experiment turnaround time and leaving a large enough corpus to obtain indicative results.
For the first model, which includes the sparse parse features, we learn weights in order to optimize penalized conditional log likelihood (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ Even with a very tight beam of 100, max-translation decoding outperforms maximum-derivation decoding, and performance is increasing even at a width of 10k.
For the first model, which includes the sparse parse features, we learn weights in order to optimize penalized conditional log likelihood (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ We believe this is because these frequency count based' models cannot easily incorporate non-independent and overlapping features, which are extremely useful in describing the translation process.

See Blunsom et al (2008) for more information. $$$$$ This is illustrated in Table 2, which shows the conditional probabilities for rules, obtained by locally normalising the rule feature weights for a simple grammar extracted from the ambiguous pair of sentences presented in DeNero et al. (2006).

We might also want to calculate the total probability of all possible derivations, which is useful for parameter estimation (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ Derivational ambiguity Table 1 shows the impact of accounting for derivational ambiguity in training and decoding.5 There are two options for training, we could use our latent variable model and optimise the probability of all derivations of the reference translation, or choose a single derivation that yields the reference and optimise its probability alone.
We might also want to calculate the total probability of all possible derivations, which is useful for parameter estimation (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ Here we see that the model finds the desired solution in which the true ambiguity of the translation rules is preserved.

Optimization problems of this form are by now widely known in NLP (Koo and Collins, 2005), and have recently been used for machine translation as well (Blunsom et al, 2008). $$$$$ Furthermore, our model explicitly accounts for spurious ambiguity without altering the model structure or arbitrarily selecting one derivation.
