Using the prefix probability, we can compute the word-by-word Surprisal (Hale, 2001), by taking the log ratio of the previous word's prefix probability against this word's prefix probability. $$$$$ On such a theory, garden-pathing cannot be explained by reanalysis.

Since the introduction of a parser-based calculation for surprisal by Hale (2001), statistical techniques have been become common as models of reading difficulty and linguistic complexity. $$$$$ Aware that the n-gram obscures many linguistically-significant distinctions (Chomsky, 1956, section 2.3), many speech researchers (Jelinek and Lafferty, 1991) sought to incorporate hierarchical phrase structure into language modeling (see (Stolcke, 1997)) although it was not until the late 1990s that such models were able to significantly improve on 3-grams (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998).

Surprisal (Hale, 2001) is then a straightforward calculation from the prefix probability. $$$$$ These loads can be efficiently calculated using a probabilistic Earley parser (Stolcke, 1995) which is interpreted as generating predictions about reading time on a word-by-word basis.
