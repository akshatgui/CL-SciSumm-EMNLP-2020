Second, there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text, a recent example being Brill 1993. $$$$$ By repeatedly comparing the results of bracketing in the current state to proper bracketing provided in the training corpus, the system learns a set of simple structural transformations that can be applied to reduce error.
Second, there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text, a recent example being Brill 1993. $$$$$ A number of systems have been built that can be trained automatically to bracket text into syntactic constituents.
Second, there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text, a recent example being Brill 1993. $$$$$ The mean sentence length of the test corpus was 11.3.
Second, there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text, a recent example being Brill 1993. $$$$$ The nonterminal-node labelling algorithm makes use of ideas suggested in (Bri92), where nonterminals are labelled as a function of the labels of their daughters.

Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993), or work with artificial samples (Elman, 1990). $$$$$ We hope these future paths will lead to a trainable and very accurate parser for free text.

Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993), or work with artificial samples (Elman, 1990). $$$$$ By repeatedly comparing the results of parsing in the current state to the proper phrase structure for each sentence in the training corpus, the system learns a set of ordered transformations which can be applied to reduce parsing error.

Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill (1993) also requires a handtagged text for training. $$$$$ In the corpus we used for the experiments of sentence length 2-15, the mean sentence length was 10.80.
Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill (1993) also requires a handtagged text for training. $$$$$ 4The twelve transformations can be decomposed into two structural transformations, that shown here and its converse, along with six triggering environments.

This idea is not new, but as far as we know it has been implemented in rule-based taggers and parsers, such as (Brill, 1993a), (Brill, 1993b), (Brill, 1993c) and (Ribarov, 1996), but not in models based on probability distributions. $$$$$ After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction.

 $$$$$ The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure.
 $$$$$ While the numbers presented above allow us to compare the transformation learner with systems trained and tested on comparable corpora, these results are all based upon the assumption that the test data is tagged fairly reliably (manually tagged text was used in all of these experiments, as well in the experiments of (PS92, SR093).)
 $$$$$ The phrase structure learning algorithm is a transformation-based error-driven learner.
