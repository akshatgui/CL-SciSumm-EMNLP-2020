Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993), or work with artificial samples (Elman, 1990). $$$$$ After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic grammar induction.
Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993), or work with artificial samples (Elman, 1990). $$$$$ Applying the first transformation to this bracketing would result in:
Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993), or work with artificial samples (Elman, 1990). $$$$$ The phrase structure learning algorithm is a transformation-based error-driven learner.

Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill (1993) also requires a handtagged text for training. $$$$$ This learning paradigm, illustrated in figure 1, has proven to be successful in a number of different natural language applications, including part of speech tagging (Bri92, BM92b), prepositional
Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill (1993) also requires a handtagged text for training. $$$$$ (Sarn86) defines a function to score the quality of parse trees, and then uses simulated annealing to heuristically explore the entire space of possible parses for a given sentence.
Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill (1993) also requires a handtagged text for training. $$$$$ Results from this experiment can be found in table 2.9 Accuracy is again In table 4, we show the standard deviation measured from three different randomly chosen training sets of each sample size and randomly chosen test sets of 500 sentences each, as well as 2-20, 63% accuracy is achieved and for sentences of length 2-25, accuracy is 59%.

This idea is not new, but as far as we know it has been implemented in rule-based taggers and parsers, such as (Brill, 1993a), (Brill, 1993b), (Brill, 1993c) and (Ribarov, 1996), but not in models based on probability distributions. $$$$$ Experiments have shown that these parses conform with high accuracy to the structural descriptions specified in a manually annotated corpus.

 $$$$$ After describing the algorithm, we present results and compare these results to other recent results in automatic phrase structure induction.
 $$$$$ If we wish to delete a left paren to the right of constituent X', where X appears in a subtree of the form: Given the sentence:5 The dog barked . this would initially be bracketed by the naive parser as: ( ( The ( dog barked) ) . )
 $$$$$ Experiments have shown that these parses conform with high accuracy to the structural descriptions specified in a manually annotated corpus.
 $$$$$ Below are the first seven transformations found from one run of training on the Wall Street Journal corpus, which was initially bracketed using the right-linear initial-state parser.
