Though several pruning algorithms have been raised (Xue and Palmer, 2004), the policies are all in global style. In this paper, a statistical analysis of Penn Prop Bank indicates that arguments are limited in a local syntax sub-tree rather than a whole one. $$$$$ Although it is conceivable that one can simply treat this as a multi-category classification problem, there are at least two reasons why such a simple approach will not work effectively.
