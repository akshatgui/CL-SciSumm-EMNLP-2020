Schafer and Yarowsky (2002) induced translation lexicons for languages without common parallel corpora using a bridge language that is related to the target languages. $$$$$ No seed dictionary is required between English and the language of interest; a sizeable dictionary between the bridge language and English is necessary.

For example, researchers have automatically developed translation lexicons by seeing if words from each language have similar frequencies, contexts (Koehn and Knight, 2002), burstiness, inverse document frequencies, and date distributions (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002). $$$$$ When intra-family orthographic shifts are clear and systematic, such models can be quite effective on their own.
