For example, researchers have automatically developed translation lexicons by seeing if words from each language have similar frequencies, contexts (Koehn and Knight, 2002), burstiness, inverse document frequencies, and date distributions (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002). $$$$$ For each language task, English news data was marked as originating either locally or non'Words with length < 5 characters were excluded. locally with respect to areas where the language is spoken, in order to facilitate computation of datedistributional similarities across both strongly related, same-region news sources (date-local) and a general, worldwide aggregate news corpus (date-all).
