Both Hall et al (2007) and Nivre and McDonald (2008) can be seen as methods to combine separately defined models. $$$$$ Thus, the new feature representation will map an arc and the entire predicted MaltParser graph to a high dimensional feature representation, f(i, j,l, GMalt x ) E Rk+m.
Both Hall et al (2007) and Nivre and McDonald (2008) can be seen as methods to combine separately defined models. $$$$$ Combinations of graph-based and transition-based models for data-driven dependency parsing have previously been explored by Sagae and Lavie (2006), who report improvements of up to 1.7 percentage points over the best single parser when combining three transition-based models and one graph-based model for unlabeled dependency parsing, evaluated on data from the Penn Treebank.
Both Hall et al (2007) and Nivre and McDonald (2008) can be seen as methods to combine separately defined models. $$$$$ However, given that we are dealing with data-driven models, it should be possible to integrate at learning time, so that the two complementary models can learn from one another.
Both Hall et al (2007) and Nivre and McDonald (2008) can be seen as methods to combine separately defined models. $$$$$ Simply put, MaltParser has an advantage in its richer feature representations, but this advantage is gradually diminished by the negative effect of error propagation due to the greedy inference strategy as sentences and dependencies get longer.

 $$$$$ This can be seen as a greedy search for the optimal dependency graph, based on a sequence of locally optimal decisions in terms of the transition system.
 $$$$$ There are many conceivable ways of combining the two parsers, including more or less complex ensemble systems and voting schemes, which only perform the integration at parsing time.
 $$$$$ Preliminary experiments suggested that cross-validation with more folds had a negligible impact on the results.
 $$$$$ Furthermore, MaltParser is more accurate for dependents that are nouns and pronouns, whereas MSTParser is more accurate for verbs, adjectives, adverbs, adpositions, and conjunctions.

For example, Nivre and McDonald (2008) present the combination of two state of the art dependency parsers feeding each another, showing that there is a significant improvement over the simple parsers. $$$$$ In this paper, we show how these results can be exploited to improve parsing accuracy by integrating a graph-based and a transition-based model.

Nivre and McDonald (2008) present an application of stacked learning to dependency parsing, in which a second predictor is trained to improve the performance of the first. $$$$$ An advantage of graph-based methods is that tractable inference enables the use of standard structured learning techniques that globally set parameters to maximize parsing performance on the training set (McDonald et al., 2005a).

 $$$$$ All features are conjoined with the part-of-speech tags of the words involved in the dependency to allow the guided parser to learn weights relative to different surface syntactic environments.

Nivre and McDonald (2008) and Zhang and Clark (2008) proposed stacking methods to combine graph-based parsers with transition-based parsers. $$$$$ Although both Malt and MST use discriminative algorithms, Malt uses a batch learning algorithm (SVM) and MST uses an online learning algorithm (MIRA).
Nivre and McDonald (2008) and Zhang and Clark (2008) proposed stacking methods to combine graph-based parsers with transition-based parsers. $$$$$ The simplest parameterization is the arc-factored model that defines a real-valued score function for arcs s(i, j, l) and further defines the score of a dependency graph as the sum of the score of all the arcs it contains.
Nivre and McDonald (2008) and Zhang and Clark (2008) proposed stacking methods to combine graph-based parsers with transition-based parsers. $$$$$ More interestingly, MaltMST outperforms both Malt and MST for arcs up to length 9, which provides evidence that MaltMST has learned specifically to trust the guide features from MST for longer dependencies.
Nivre and McDonald (2008) and Zhang and Clark (2008) proposed stacking methods to combine graph-based parsers with transition-based parsers. $$$$$ The difference, of course, is that standard co-training is a weakly supervised method, where guide features replace, rather than complement, the gold standard annotation during training.

Therefore, the integration of both techniques as in Nivre and McDonald (2008) seems to be very promising. $$$$$ Preliminary experiments suggested that cross-validation with more folds had a negligible impact on the results.

 $$$$$ On the other hand, an online learning algorithm will recognize the guided features as strong indicators early in training and give them a high weight as a result.
 $$$$$ To learn a scoring function on transitions, these systems rely on discriminative learning methods, such as memory-based learning or support vector machines, using a strictly local learning procedure where only single transitions are scored (not complete transition sequences).
 $$$$$ By letting one model generate features for the other, we consistently improve accuracy for both models, resulting in a significant improvement of the state of the art when evaluated on data sets from the CoNLL-X shared task.

Although Mate's performance was not significantly better than Berkeley's in our setting, it has the potential to tap richer features and other advantages of dependency parsers (Nivre and McDonald, 2008) to further boost accuracy, which may be difficult in the generative framework of a typical constituent parser. $$$$$ We call this system MSTParser, or simply MST for short, which is also the name of the freely available implementation.2 Transition-based dependency parsing systems use a model parameterized over transitions of an abstract machine for deriving dependency graphs, such that every transition sequence from the designated initial configuration to some terminal configuration derives a valid dependency graph.

We experimented on French using a part-of-speech tagger but we could also use another parser and either use the methodology of (Johnsonand Ural, 2010) or (Zhang et al, 2009) which fusion n-best lists form different parsers, or use stacking methods where an additional parser is used as a guide for the main parser (Nivre and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ But where MST is good, MSTMalt is often significantly better.
