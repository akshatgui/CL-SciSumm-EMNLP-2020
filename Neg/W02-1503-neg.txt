Over the past few years, there has been considerable progress in the ability of manually created large-scale grammars, such as the English Resource Grammar (ERG, Copestake and Flickinger (2000)) or the ParGram grammars (Butt et al, 2002), to parse wide-coverage text and assign it deep semantic representations. $$$$$ For example, if a language does not have an ADEGREE (adjective degree) feature, the question will arise as to whether the grammar analyzes comparative and superlative adjectives.

The only rule-based approach to German LFG-parsing we are aware of is the hand-crafted German grammar in the ParGram Project (Buttet al, 2002). $$$$$ Even if not all of the languages have the construction in question, as was the case with clefts, the grammar writers for that language may have interesting ideas on how to analyze it.

In order for our approach to work, the coverage of the precision grammars must be broad enough to parse a large corpus of grammatical sentences, and for this reason, we choose the XLE (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996), an efficient and robust parsing system for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplanand Bresnan, 1982) and the ParGram English grammar (Butt et al, 2002) for our experiments. $$$$$ Norwegian assumes a typological middle position between German and English, sharing different properties with each of them.
