Over the past few years, there has been considerable progress in the ability of manually created large-scale grammars, such as the English Resource Grammar (ERG, Copestake and Flickinger (2000)) or the ParGram grammars (Butt et al, 2002), to parse wide-coverage text and assign it deep semantic representations. $$$$$ If they do not, then they should be added and should use the ADEGREE feature; if they do, then the question arises as to why they do not have this feature as part of their analysis.

These tools have been developed to serve an Arabic Lexical Functional Grammar parser using XLE (Xerox Linguistics Environment) platform as part of the ParGram Project (Butt et al 2002). $$$$$ However, even when the grammars are used for different purposes and have different additional features, they have maintained their basic parallelism in analysis and have profited from the shared grammar writing techniques and technology.

Aspects of this research have often had their own separate fora, such as the ACL 2005 workshop on deep lexical acquisition (Baldwin et al, 2005), as well as the TAG+ (Kallmeyer and Becker, 2006), Alpino (van der Beek et al, 2005), ParGram (Butt et al, 2002) and DELPH-IN (Oepen et al, 2002) projects and meetings. $$$$$ For instance, the Norwegian grammar, unlike the other grammars, implements the principles in (Bresnan, 2001) concerning the relationship between an X -based c-structure and the f-structure.

A full system using the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) parsing system XLE and the grammars from the Parallel Grammar development project (ParGram; (Butt et al., 2002)) has been implemented, and we present preliminary results on English-to-German translation with a tree-labeling system trained on a small subsection of the Europarl corpus. $$$$$ The Norwegian and Urdu grammars are smaller scale but are experimenting with incorporating different kinds of information into the grammar.

 $$$$$ The grammars’ analyses show a large degree of parallelism, despite being developed at different sites.
 $$$$$ Despite this typological challenge, the Japanese grammar has achieved broad coverage and high performance within a year and a half.
 $$$$$ It was found that the grammar writing techniques and guidelines to maintain parallelism shared in the ParGram project could be efficiently applied to the Japanese grammar.

The experiments reported in this paper use the German LFG grammar constructed as part of the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ In addition, time was spent on improving existing lexical resources ( 80,000 lemmas) and adapting them to the XLE format.
The experiments reported in this paper use the German LFG grammar constructed as part of the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ However, providing a ANIM + feature to known animates, such as people’s names and pronouns, allows the grammar to encode information that is relevant for interpretation.

We compared the output of the XLE system, a deep-grammar-based parsing system using the English Lexical-Functional Grammar previously constructed as part of the Pargram project (Butt et al, 2002), to the same gold standard. $$$$$ Given this system, in a year and a half, using two grammar writers, the Japanese grammar has attained coverage of 99% for 500 sentences of a copier manual and 95% for 10,000 sentences of an eCRM (Voice-of-Customer) corpus.

The grammar used for this experiment was developed in the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ The experiences of the ParGram grammar writers has shown that the parallelism of analysis and implementation in the ParGram project aids further grammar development efforts.

The only rule-based approach to German LFG-parsing we are aware of is the hand-crafted German grammar in the ParGram Project (Buttet al, 2002). $$$$$ However, as the grammars expand coverage, more constructions need to be integrated into the grammars, and these constructions tend to be ones for which there is no standard analysis in the linguistic literature; so, differences can easily arise in these areas.

In order for our approach to work, the coverage of the precision grammars must be broad enough to parse a large corpus of grammatical sentences, and for this reason, we choose the XLE (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996), an efficient and robust parsing system for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplanand Bresnan, 1982) and the ParGram English grammar (Butt et al, 2002) for our experiments. $$$$$ LFG assumes a version of Chomsky’s Universal Grammar hypothesis, namely that all languages are structured by similar underlying principles.
