Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employ a great many sophisticated post-hoc adjustments to obtain the right conflation sets for words by pure corpus analysis without annotations. $$$$$ Our algorithm extends earlier approaches to morphology induction by combining various induced information sources: the semantic relatedness of the affixed forms using a Latent Semantic Analysis approach to corpusbased semantics (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), affix frequency, syntactic context, and transitive closure.
Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employ a great many sophisticated post-hoc adjustments to obtain the right conflation sets for words by pure corpus analysis without annotations. $$$$$ SVD computations can be expensive and impractical for large values of N. Yet due to the fact that U and VT are orthogonal matrices, we can start with a matrix of reasonablesized N and “fold in” the remaining terms, which is the approach we have followed.
Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employ a great many sophisticated post-hoc adjustments to obtain the right conflation sets for words by pure corpus analysis without annotations. $$$$$ In an attempt to avoid this labor-intensive process, recent work has focused on machine-learning approaches to induce morphological structure using large corpora.

Approaches to the induction of morphology as presented in e.g. Schone and Jurafsky (2001) or Goldsmith (2001) show that the morphological properties of a small subset of languages can be induced with high accuracy, most of the existing approaches are motivated by applied or engineering concerns, and thus make assumptions that are less cognitively plausible. $$$$$ Additionally, highfrequency function words may be conflated due to having weak semantic information (“as”—“a”).

Schone and Jurafsky (2001) select words with frequency higher than 5 to induce morphological segmentation. $$$$$ A validity threshold (T ) of morphological variants is directly derivable from the 85% would mean that the four bottom PPMVs cost of transforming C1 into C2. would be deemed invalid.

Presupposing input driven learning, it has been shown in the literature that initial segmenations into words (or word-like units) is possible with unsupervised methods (e.g. Brent and Cartwright (1996)), that induction of morphology is possible (e.g. Goldsmith (2001), Schone and Jurafsky (2001)) and even the induction of syntactic structures (e.g. Van Zaanen (2001)). $$$$$ Our algorithm is also applied to German and Dutch and evaluated on its ability to find prefixes, suffixes, and circumfixes in these languages.

In later work, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) extend their technique to identify not only suffixes but also prefixes and circumfixes by building both forward and backward tries over a corpus. $$$$$ Yet we build upon this algorithm in several ways in that we: [1] consider circumfixes, [2] automatically identify capitalizations by treating them similar to prefixes [3] incorporate frequency information, [4] use distributional information to help identify syntactic properties, and [5] use transitive closure to help find variants that may not have been found to be semantically related but which are related to mutual variants.

 $$$$$ Such word sets form Prs-o (valid) = Prsem +Prorth - (Prsem Prorth ).
