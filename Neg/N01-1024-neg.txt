Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employ a great many sophisticated post-hoc adjustments to obtain the right conflation sets for words by pure corpus analysis without annotations. $$$$$ To our knowledge, this serves as the first evaluation of complete regular morphological induction of German or Dutch (although researchers such as Nakisa and Hahn (1996) have evaluated induction algorithms on morphological sub-problems in German).

Approaches to the induction of morphology as presented in e.g. Schone and Jurafsky (2001) or Goldsmith (2001) show that the morphological properties of a small subset of languages can be induced with high accuracy, most of the existing approaches are motivated by applied or engineering concerns, and thus make assumptions that are less cognitively plausible. $$$$$ For the future, we expect improvements could be derived by coupling this work, which focuses primarily on inducing regular morphology, with that of Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), who assume some information about regular morphology in order to induce irregular morphology.

Presupposing input driven learning, it has been shown in the literature that initial segmenations into words (or word-like units) is possible with unsupervised methods (e.g. Brent and Cartwright (1996)), that induction of morphology is possible (e.g. Goldsmith (2001), Schone and Jurafsky (2001)) and even the induction of syntactic structures (e.g. Van Zaanen (2001)). $$$$$ Our algorithm combines cues from orthography, semantics, and syntactic distributions to induce morphological relationships in German, Dutch, and English.
