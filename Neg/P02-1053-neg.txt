Most of the authors traditionally use a classification-based approach for sentiment extraction and sentiment polarity detection (for example, Pang et al (2002), Turney (2002), Kim and Hovy (2004) and others), however, the research described in this paper uses the information retrieval (IR) paradigm which has also been used by some researchers. $$$$$ Hearst (1992) observes that most search engines focus on finding documents on a given topic, but do not allow the user to specify the directionality of the documents (e.g., is the author in favor of, neutral, or opposed to the event or item discussed in the document?).

At phase level, Turney (2002) presents a technique for inferring the orientation and intensity of a phrase according to its PMI-IR statistical association with a set of strongly-polarized seed words. $$$$$ It appears that movie reviews are difficult to classify, because the whole is not necessarily the sum of the parts; thus the accuracy on movie reviews is about 66%.

Based on (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) and (Turney, 2002), we consider four types of structures (as shown in Table 5) during sentiment phrase extraction. $$$$$ However, in this case, Google1 reports about 5,000 matches.

Different from (Turney, 2002), we consider phrases with negations as their initial words. $$$$$ PMI-IR has been empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), obtaining a score of 74% (Turney, 2001).
Different from (Turney, 2002), we consider phrases with negations as their initial words. $$$$$ The following estimate of SO can be derived from equations (1) and (2) with some minor algebraic manipulation, if cooccurrence is interpreted as NEAR: To avoid division by zero, I added 0.01 to the hits.

The problem of sentiment extraction at the document level (sentiment classification) has been tackled as a text categorization task in which the goal is to assign to a document either positive ("thumbs up") or negative ("thumbs down") polarity (e.g. Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al. (2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al. (2003), Pang and Lee (2004)). $$$$$ A natural question, given the preceding results, is what makes movie reviews hard to classify?

Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method. $$$$$ As a courtesy to AltaVista, I used a five second delay between queries.8 The 410 reviews yielded 10,658 phrases, so the total time required to process the corpus was roughly 106,580 seconds, or about 30 hours.

Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method. $$$$$ To eliminate any possible influence from the testing data, I added “AND (NOT host:epinions)” to every query, which tells AltaVista not to include the Epinions Web site in its searches.
Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method. $$$$$ However, PMI-IR is conceptually simpler, easier to implement, and it can handle phrases and adverbs, in addition to isolated adjectives.

In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ A positive review could be summarized by picking out the sentence with the highest positive semantic orientation and a negative review could be summarized by extracting the sentence with the lowest negative semantic orientation.
In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The latter difficulty might be addressed by using semantic orientation combined with other features in a supervised classification algorithm.
In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Except for the travel reviews, there is surprisingly little variation in the accuracy within a domain.

Thus, the method we investigate can be seen as a combination of methods for propagating sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for building sentiment lexicons based on distributional characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The ratio between p(word1 & word2) and p(word1) p(word2) is thus a measure of the degree of statistical dependence between the words.
Thus, the method we investigate can be seen as a combination of methods for propagating sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for building sentiment lexicons based on distributional characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Sentences are interpreted metaphorically in terms of agents exerting force, resisting force, and overcoming resistance.
Thus, the method we investigate can be seen as a combination of methods for propagating sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for building sentiment lexicons based on distributional characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ For example, the adjective “unpredictable” may have a negative orientation in an automotive review, in a phrase such as “unpredictable steering”, but it could have a positive orientation in a movie review, in a phrase such as “unpredictable plot”.

Others, such as Turney (2002), Pang and Vaithyanathan (2002), have examined the positive or negative polarity, rather than presence or absence, of affective content in text. $$$$$ Let hits(query) be the number of hits returned, given the query query.

Much of the work in sentiment analysis in the computational linguistics domain has focused either on short segments, such as sentences (Wilson et al, 2005), or on longer documents with an explicit polarity orientation like movie or product reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ On the other hand, for banks and automobiles, it seems that the whole is the sum of the parts, and the accuracy is 80% to 84%.
Much of the work in sentiment analysis in the computational linguistics domain has focused either on short segments, such as sentences (Wilson et al, 2005), or on longer documents with an explicit polarity orientation like movie or product reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Past work has demonstrated that adjectives are good indicators of subjective, evaluative sentences (Hatzivassiloglou & Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2001).

These methods range from manual approaches of developing domain-dependent lexicons (Das and Chan, 2001) to semi-automated approaches (Hu and Liu, 2004) and fully automated approaches (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Travel reviews are an intermediate case.

Therefore, the overall sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of the content parts (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ This paper introduces a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for rating a review as thumbs up or down.
Therefore, the overall sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of the content parts (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ This could yield higher accuracies, but the intent here was to study this one feature in isolation, to simplify the analysis, before combining it with other features.
Therefore, the overall sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of the content parts (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ A pro/con summarizer could be evaluated by measuring the overlap between the reviewer’s pros and cons and the phrases in the review that have the most extreme semantic orientation.
Therefore, the overall sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of the content parts (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., “subtle nuances”) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., “very cavalier”).

Also, PMI-IR is useful for calculating semantic orientation and rating reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Messages are classified by looking for specific phrases that indicate the sentiment of the author towards the movie (e.g., “great acting”, “wonderful visuals”, “terrible score”, “uneven editing”).
Also, PMI-IR is useful for calculating semantic orientation and rating reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The semantic orientation of a given phrase is calculated by comparing its similarity to a positive reference word (“excellent”) with its similarity to a negative reference word (“poor”).
