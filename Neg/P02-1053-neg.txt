Most of the authors traditionally use a classification-based approach for sentiment extraction and sentiment polarity detection (for example, Pang et al (2002), Turney (2002), Kim and Hovy (2004) and others), however, the research described in this paper uses the information retrieval (IR) paradigm which has also been used by some researchers. $$$$$ If the words are statistically independent, then the probability that they co-occur is given by the product p(word1) p(word2).

Following (Turney, 2002), Yuen et al (2004) investigate the association between polarity words and some strongly-polarized morphemes in Chinese, and present a method for inferring sentiment orientations of Chinese words. $$$$$ I also skipped phrase when both hits(phrase NEAR “excellent”) and hits(phrase NEAR “poor”) were (simultaneously) less than four.

At phase level, Turney (2002) presents a technique for inferring the orientation and intensity of a phrase according to its PMI-IR statistical association with a set of strongly-polarized seed words. $$$$$ A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., “subtle nuances”) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., “very cavalier”).

Based on (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) and (Turney, 2002), we consider four types of structures (as shown in Table 5) during sentiment phrase extraction. $$$$$ Always guessing the majority class would yield an accuracy of 59%.

Different from (Turney, 2002), we consider phrases with negations as their initial words. $$$$$ To eliminate any possible influence from the testing data, I added “AND (NOT host:epinions)” to every query, which tells AltaVista not to include the Epinions Web site in its searches.

Turney (2002) described a way to automatically build such a lexicon based on looking at co-occurrences of words with other words whose sentiment is known. $$$$$ The log of this ratio is the amount of information that we acquire about the presence of one of the words when we observe the other.

The problem of sentiment extraction at the document level (sentiment classification) has been tackled as a text categorization task in which the goal is to assign to a document either positive ("thumbs up") or negative ("thumbs down") polarity (e.g. Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al. (2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al. (2003), Pang and Lee (2004)). $$$$$ 170 (41%) of the reviews are not recommended and the remaining 240 (59%) are recommended.

Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method. $$$$$ They note that there are linguistic constraints on the semantic orientations of adjectives in conjunctions.

In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Table 4 describes the 410 reviews from Epinions that were used in the experiments.
In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ NNP and NNPS (singular and plural proper nouns) are avoided, so that the names of the items in the review cannot influence the classification.
In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ However, PMI-IR is conceptually simpler, easier to implement, and it can handle phrases and adverbs, in addition to isolated adjectives.

Thus, the method we investigate can be seen as a combination of methods for propagating sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for building sentiment lexicons based on distributional characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The difficulty with movie reviews is that there are two aspects to a movie, the events and actors in the movie (the elements of the movie), and the style and art of the movie (the movie as a gestalt; a unified whole).

Others, such as Turney (2002), Pang and Vaithyanathan (2002), have examined the positive or negative polarity, rather than presence or absence, of affective content in text. $$$$$ Preliminary experiments indicate that semantic orientation is also useful for summarization of reviews.

Much of the work in sentiment analysis in the computational linguistics domain has focused either on short segments, such as sentences (Wilson et al, 2005), or on longer documents with an explicit polarity orientation like movie or product reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The core of the algorithm is the second step, which uses PMI-IR to calculate semantic orientation (Turney, 2001).

These methods range from manual approaches of developing domain-dependent lexicons (Das and Chan, 2001) to semi-automated approaches (Hu and Liu, 2004) and fully automated approaches (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ In addition to recommended and not recommended, Epinions reviews are classified using the five star rating system.

Therefore, the overall sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of the content parts (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ On the other hand, for banks and automobiles, it seems that the whole is the sum of the parts, and the accuracy is 80% to 84%.

Like our class-attribute associations, the common-sense knowledge that the word cool is positive while unethical is negative can be learned from associations in web-scale data (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ This could yield higher accuracies, but the intent here was to study this one feature in isolation, to simplify the analysis, before combining it with other features.
