Empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which a discourse marker occurs, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse usages in about 80% of cases. $$$$$ The most prominent accent in a phrase is termed the nuclear stress, or nuclear H* accent on now. accent, of the phrase.

We extract the initial unigram, bigram, and trigram of each utterance as discourse features (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ These results strengthen the claim that the discourse structures crucial to computational models of interaction, in this case, certain lexical indicators of discourse structure, can indeed be identified.

In the literature, there is still no consistent definition for discourse markers (Hirschberg and Litman 1993). $$$$$ Lexical items that do bear pitch accents are said to be accented, while those not so marked are said to be deaccented.

This is due to the fact that, similar to the question of cue phrase polysemy (Hirschberg and Litman 1993), many Chinese discourse markers have both discourse senses and alternate sentential senses in different utterances. $$$$$ This work was partially supported by DARPA under contract N00039-84-C-0165.

Annotation includes two stages: first, we allowed two coders to choose 'explanation' relations signaled by because using (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993)'s 3-way classification. $$$$$ However, while cue phrases may convey discourse structure, each also has one or more alternate uses.

Many discourse segmentation techniques (e.g. Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) as well as some topic segmentation algorithms rely on cue words and phrases. $$$$$ Furthermore, we found that orthographic cues (from transcription) successfully disambiguate between discourse and sentential usage in 675 cases (80.1% of the 843).
Many discourse segmentation techniques (e.g. Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) as well as some topic segmentation algorithms rely on cue words and phrases. $$$$$ Of the 953 tokens in this corpus, we agreed in our judgments of 878 cue phrases (92.1%) as discourse or sentential.
Many discourse segmentation techniques (e.g. Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) as well as some topic segmentation algorithms rely on cue words and phrases. $$$$$ So, a broader discourse scope for a cue phrase may be signalled by setting it apart from other items that it might potentially modify if interpreted more narrowly.

 $$$$$ Are there perhaps orthographic correlates of the intonational features that we have found to be important in speech?
 $$$$$ Although distinguishing discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases is critical to the interpretation and generation of discourse, the question of how speakers and hearers accomplish this disambiguation is rarely addressed.
