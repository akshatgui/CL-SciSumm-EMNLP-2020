Empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which a discourse marker occurs, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse usages in about 80% of cases. $$$$$ A prosodic model that characterizes these distinctions is identified.

We extract the initial unigram, bigram, and trigram of each utterance as discourse features (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ For example, signal the beginning of a subtopic or a return a previous topic, while mark subsequent material as a response to prior material, or as an explanatory comment.
We extract the initial unigram, bigram, and trigram of each utterance as discourse features (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ So, perhaps it is the intonational information present in speech, but missing generally in transcription, which aids hearers in disambiguating between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases.

We extract the initial unigram, bigram, and trigram of each utterance as discourse features (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ These results strengthen the claim that the discourse structures crucial to computational models of interaction, in this case, certain lexical indicators of discourse structure, can indeed be identified.

In the literature, there is still no consistent definition for discourse markers (Hirschberg and Litman 1993). $$$$$ In this account, the L* accent is analyzed as conveying that an item is salient in the discourse, but for some reason should not be added to speaker and hearer's mutual belief space.

This is due to the fact that, similar to the question of cue phrase polysemy (Hirschberg and Litman 1993), many Chinese discourse markers have both discourse senses and alternate sentential senses in different utterances. $$$$$ We thank Ron Brachman for providing one of our corpora and Jan van Santen for helpful comments on this work.

Annotation includes two stages $$$$$ The corpus was transcribed by Martha Pollack and Julia Hirschberg in 1982, in connection with another study.

Annotation includes two stages $$$$$ Based on these studies, we have proposed an intonational model for cue phrase disambiguation in speech, based on intonational phrasing and pitch accent, and a model for cue phrase disambiguation in text, based on orthographic indicators and part-ofspeech information.

Many discourse segmentation techniques (e.g. Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) as well as some topic segmentation algorithms rely on cue words and phrases. $$$$$ Uttered as two phrases (Bill doesn't drink—because he's unhappy), it is more likely to convey that Bill does not drink—and the reason for his abstinence is his unhappiness.

We use a list of cue phrases identified by Hirschberg and Litman (1993). $$$$$ Although distinguishing discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases is critical to the interpretation and generation of discourse, the question of how speakers and hearers accomplish this disambiguation is rarely addressed.
We use a list of cue phrases identified by Hirschberg and Litman (1993). $$$$$ L* accents, on the other hand, are used to indicate that an item is salient in the discourse but for some reason should not be part of what is added to the mutual belief space; standard yes/no question contour in English employs L* accents.

We use a list of cue phrases identified by Hirschberg and Litman (1993). $$$$$ This paper reports results of empirical studies on discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases, in which both text-based and prosodic features were examined for disambiguating power.

Perhaps the most studied cue for discourse structure are lexical cues, also called cue phrases, which are defined as follows by Hirschberg and Litman (1993). $$$$$ Based on these studies, it is proposed that discourse versus sentential usage may be distinguished by intonational features, specifically, pitch accent and prosodic phrasing.

For example Hirschberg and Litman (1993) found that into national phrasing and pitch accent play a role in disambiguating cue phrases, and hence in helping determine discourse structure. $$$$$ Note that without cue phrases as explicit indicators of this topic structure, one would have to infer the relationships among discourse segments by appeal to a more detailed analysis of the semantic content of the passage.
For example Hirschberg and Litman (1993) found that into national phrasing and pitch accent play a role in disambiguating cue phrases, and hence in helping determine discourse structure. $$$$$ However, although we chose to study now for its ambiguity between discourse and sentential (temporal adverbial) uses, it may of course also be seen as representative of sense ambiguities between temporals and nontemporals or deictics and nondeictics.

Many researchers have attempted to make use of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Once we had classified the tokens in the corpus, we analyzed them for their prosodic and syntactic features as well as their orthographic context, in the same way we had examined tokens for the earlier two studies.
