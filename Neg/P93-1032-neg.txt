Techniques for the automatic acquisition of subcategofization dictionaries have been developed by Manning (1993), Bfiscoe and Carroll (1997) and Carroll and Rooth (1998). $$$$$ The finite state parser The finite state parser essentially works as follows: it scans through text until it hits a verb or auxiliary, it parses any auxiliaries, noting whether the verb is active or passive, and then it parses complements following the verb until something recognized as a terminator of subcategorized arguments is reached.11 Whatever has been found is entered in the histogram.
