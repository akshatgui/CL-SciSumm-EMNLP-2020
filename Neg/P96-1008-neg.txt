This use of model-theoretic interpretation represents an important extension to thesemantic grammars used in existing statistical spoken language interfaces, which rely on co-occurrences among lexically-determined semantic classes and slot fillers (Miller et al, 1996), in that the probability of an analysis is now also conditioned on the existence of denoted entities and relations in the world model. $$$$$ The models are fully integrated, resulting in an end-to-end system that maps input utterances into meaning representation frames.

Transition probabilities are estimated directly by observing occurrence and transition frequencies in a training corpus of annotated parse trees.

Examples include an early statistical method for learning to fill slot-value representations (Miller et al, 1996) and a more recent approach for recovering semantic parse trees (Ge & Mooney, 2006). $$$$$ In this test, the system was trained on approximately 4000 ATIS 2 and ATIS 3 sentences, and then evaluated on the December 1994 test material (which was held aside as a blind test set).

The Miller et al (1996) approach is fully supervised and produces a final meaning representation in SQL. $$$$$ Given a string of input words W and a discourse history H, the task of a statistical language understanding system is to search among the many possible discourse-dependent meanings MD for the most likely meaning Mo: Mo = arg max P(MD I W, H).
The Miller et al (1996) approach is fully supervised and produces a final meaning representation in SQL. $$$$$ A common approach in non-statistical natural language systems is to bridge this gap by introducing intermediate representations such as parse structure and pre-discourse sentence meaning.
The Miller et al (1996) approach is fully supervised and produces a final meaning representation in SQL. $$$$$ This assumption is justified because the word tags in our parse representation specify both semantic and syntactic class information.
