This use of model-theoretic interpretation represents an important extension to thesemantic grammars used in existing statistical spoken language interfaces, which rely on co-occurrences among lexically-determined semantic classes and slot fillers (Miller et al, 1996), in that the probability of an analysis is now also conditioned on the existence of denoted entities and relations in the world model. $$$$$ The final result of these steps is the n-best set of candidate pre-discourse meanings, scored according to the measure P(Ms,T) P(W IT) .

Examples include an early statistical method for learning to fill slot-value representations (Miller et al, 1996) and a more recent approach for recovering semantic parse trees (Ge & Mooney, 2006). $$$$$ We have presented a fully trained statistical natural language interface system, with separate models corresponding to the classical processing steps of parsing, semantic interpretation and discourse.

We are only aware of one system that learns to construct context-dependent interpretations (Miller et al, 1996). $$$$$ This inheritance phenomenon, similar in spirit to one-anaphora, is illustrated by the following dialog:: SYSTEM2: <displays Boston to Denver flights for Tuesday> In USER2, it is obvious from context that the user is asking about flights whose ORIGIN is BOSTON and whose DESTINATION is DENVER, and not all flights between any two cities.
