In POS tagging, the previous best performance was reported by (Shen et al, 2007) as summarized in Table 7. $$$$$ Each span p considered by the algorithm is associated with one or more hypotheses, that is, sequences over T having the same length as p. Part of the label sequence of each hypothesis is used as a context for labeling tokens outside the span p. For example, if a tri-gram model is adopted, we use the two labels on the left boundary and the two labels on the right boundary of the hypothesis for labeling outside tokens.
