We have used LTPOS (Mikheev, 1997), which performed the task almost error less. $$$$$ The cascading guesser also helped to improve the accuracy on unknown proper nouns by about 1% in comparison to Brill's guesser and about 3°/0 in comparison to Xerox's guesser.

The search for such rules has previously been conducted in the context of supervised part-of-speech tagging (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ As for Brill's schemata that checks the presence of a particular character in an unknown word, we capture a similar feature by collecting the endingguessing rules for proper nouns and hyphenated words separately.

PoS tagging can be performed using LTPOS (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ This means that neither the HMM tagger nor the cascading guesser had been trained on the texts and words used for evaluation.

A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ For instance, discussing the problem of unknown words for the robust parsing Bod (1995, 84) writes: &quot;Notice that richer, morphological annotation would not be of any help here; the words &quot;return&quot;, &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;cost&quot; do not have a morphological structure on the basis of which their possible lexical categories can be predicted.&quot; When we applied the ending-guessing rules to these words, the words return and stop were correctly classified as noun/verbs (NN vs vim)) and only the word cost failed to be guessed by the rules.

The next stage in the linguistic analysis module performs noun group and verb group chunking using fsg match with the specialised hand-written rule sets which were the core part of LT CHUNK (Finch and Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ This can be accounted for by the fact that the unguessed capitalized words were taken by default to be proper nouns and that the Brill tagger and the HMM tagger had slightly different strategies to apply to the first word of a sentence.

The stripping-recoding rules could be manually encoded, mined from a monolingual corpus usinga learning method such as (Mikheev, 1997), or supplied by a source terminology extraction system that handles morphological variations. $$$$$ This technique has been partially outlined in (Mikheev 1996a, 1996b) and, along with a level of accuracy for the induced rules that is higher than any previously quoted, it has an advantage in terms of quantity and simplicity of annotation of data for training.

Transitions to the normal and pivotal stage occur when an estimator of the relative frequency is high enough, for example by taking the lower bound of the confidence interval (Mikheev,1997). $$$$$ Since, arguably, the guessing of proper nouns is easier than is the guessing of other categories, we also measured the error rate for the subcategory of capitalized unknown words separately.
