We will perform a semi-automatic validation of BabelNet, e.g. by exploiting Amazon's Mechanical Turk (Callison-Burch, 2009) or designing a collaborative game (von Ahn, 2006) to validate low-ranking mappings and translations. $$$$$ We evaluate non-expert Turker judges by measuring their inter-annotator agreement with the WMT08 expert judges, and by comparing the correlation coefficient across the rankings of the machine translation systems produced by the two sets of judges. equal.

For example, Callison-Burch (2009) used MTurk to evaluate machine translations. $$$$$ The low cost of the non-expert labor found on Mechanical Turk is cheap enough to collect redundant annotations, which can be utilized to ensure translation quality.
For example, Callison-Burch (2009) used MTurk to evaluate machine translations. $$$$$ Amazon provides three mechanisms to help ensure quality: First, Requesters can have each HIT be completed by multiple Turkers, which allows higher quality labels to be selected, for instance, by taking the majority label.
For example, Callison-Burch (2009) used MTurk to evaluate machine translations. $$$$$ We show that:

The use of crowd sourcing to evaluate machine translation and to build development sets was pioneered by Callison-Burch (2009) and Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2009). $$$$$ They were asked to rank the translations relative to each other, assigning scores from best to worst and allowing ties.

Following Callison-Burch (2009), we treat evaluation as a weighted voting problem where each annotator's contribution is weighted by agreement with either a gold standard or with other annotators. $$$$$ Anyone with an Amazon account can either submit HITs or work on HITs that were submitted by others.

It has also been used in MT evaluation (Callison-Burch, 2009), though that evaluation used reference translations. $$$$$ Answers to Where was Ms. Locklear two months ago? that were judged to be correct: Arizona hospital for treatment of depression; at a treatmend clinic in Arizona; in the Arizona clinic being treated for nervous breakdown; a clinic in Arizona; Arizona, under treatment for depression; She was a patient in a clinic in Arizona undergoing treatment for anxiety and depression; In an Arizona mental health facility ; A clinic in Arizona.

As an example, among the collected material several translations in languages other than English revealed a massive and defective use of on-line translation tools by untrusted workers, as also observed by (Callison-Burch, 2009). $$$$$ The witness stated that around 4.30pm Ms. Locklear “hit the accelerator very roughly, making excessive noise and trying to take the car out from the parking space with abrupt back and forth maneuvers.
As an example, among the collected material several translations in languages other than English revealed a massive and defective use of on-line translation tools by untrusted workers, as also observed by (Callison-Burch, 2009). $$$$$ Public evaluation campaigns provide a ready source of goldstandard data that non-expert annotations can be compared to.
