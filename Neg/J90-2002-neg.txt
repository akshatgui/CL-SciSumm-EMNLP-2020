Systems for automatic translation between languages have been divided into transfer-based approaches, which rely on interpreting the source string into an abstract semantic representation from which text is generated in the target language, and statistical approaches, pioneered by Brown et al (1990), which estimate parameters for a model of word-to-word correspondences and word re-orderings directly from large corpora of parallel bilingual text. $$$$$ The word par is produced from a special English word which is denoted by ( null ).
