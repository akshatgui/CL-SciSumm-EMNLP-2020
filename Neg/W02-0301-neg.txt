In the case of term classification, Kazama et al (2002) used a more exhaustive feature set containing lexical information, POS tags, affixes and their combinations in order to recognise and classify terms into a set of general biological classes used within the GENIA project (GENIA, 2003). $$$$$ Experiments on the GENIA corpus show that our class splitting technique not only enables the training with the GENIA corpus but also improves the accuracy.
