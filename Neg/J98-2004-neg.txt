The (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) article considers a number of different figures of merit for ordering the agenda, and ultimately recommends one that reduces the number of edges required for a full parse into the thousands. $$$$$ The literature shows many implementations of best-first parsing, but none of the previous work shares our goal of explicitly comparing figures of merit.
The (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) article considers a number of different figures of merit for ordering the agenda, and ultimately recommends one that reduces the number of edges required for a full parse into the thousands. $$$$$ Appendix A gives details of our on-line computation of 0.
The (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) article considers a number of different figures of merit for ordering the agenda, and ultimately recommends one that reduces the number of edges required for a full parse into the thousands. $$$$$ Sections 4 and 5 have a similar structure to Section 3, with Section 4 evaluating two figures of merit using statistics on the left-side context of the constituent, and Section 5 evaluating three additional figures of merit using statistics on the context on both sides of the constituent.

(Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and [Gold98] use a figure which indicates the merit of a given constituent or edge, relative only to itself and its children but independent of the progress of the parse we will call this the edge's independent merit (IM). $$$$$ Again, see Appendix B for details of how these estimates were obtained.
(Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and [Gold98] use a figure which indicates the merit of a given constituent or edge, relative only to itself and its children but independent of the progress of the parse we will call this the edge's independent merit (IM). $$$$$ Similarly, the boundary trigram estimate is an approximation to an estimate involving the full context, i.e., an estimate involving the outside probability a.
(Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and [Gold98] use a figure which indicates the merit of a given constituent or edge, relative only to itself and its children but independent of the progress of the parse we will call this the edge's independent merit (IM). $$$$$ We assume that the probability of the nonterminal depends only on the immediately preceding tag, and that the probability of the tag immediately following the nonterminal depends only on the nonterminal (see Figure 10), giving: We can calculate 0(1\711,k) and the tritag probabilities as usual.
(Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and [Gold98] use a figure which indicates the merit of a given constituent or edge, relative only to itself and its children but independent of the progress of the parse we will call this the edge's independent merit (IM). $$$$$ Since we have a complete parse, the inside and outside probabilities and the sentence probability can be easily computed.

 $$$$$ Adding right contextual information in the boundary trigram estimate gives us the best performance on this measure of any of our figures of merit.
 $$$$$ Bobrow (1990) and Chitrao and Grishman (1990) introduced statistical agendabased parsing techniques.
 $$$$$ We propose and evaluate several figures of merit for best-first parsing, and we identify an easily computable figure of merit that provides excellent performance on various measures and two different grammars.
 $$$$$ Some figure of merit is needed by which to compare the likelihood of constituents, and the choice of this figure has a substantial impact on the efficiency of the parser.

 $$$$$ Since the boundary trigram estimate has none of the overhead associated with the prefix estimate, it is the best performer in terms of CPU time as well.
 $$$$$ Sentence length was limited to a maximum of 30 because of the huge number of edges that are generated in doing a full parse of long sentences; using this grammar, sentences in this length range have produced up to 130,000 edges.
 $$$$$ While several parsers described in the literature have used such techniques, there is little published data on their efficacy, much less attempts to judge their relative merits.

Again it is reminiscent of a best-first parser (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) in the use of an agenda and a chart, but is fundamentally different due to the fact that there is no input order. $$$$$ The authors are very grateful to Heidi Fox for obtaining the speed vs. accuracy data discussed in Appendix C. We also wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

 $$$$$ This figure has the additional advantage that it can be easily incorporated into existing best-first parsers using a figure of merit based on inside probability.

Chitrao and Grishman (1990), Caraballo and Charniak (1998), Charniak et al (1998), and Collins (1999) describe best-first parsing, which is intended for a tabular item-based framework. $$$$$ We will refer to this figure as the boundary trigram estimate.

Best-first parsers deal with this by allowing an upward propagation, which updates such edges' scores (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ However, while these two models produce Average CPU time for 95% of the probability mass for the 0 estimates. near-equivalent performance for short sentences, for longer sentences, with length greater than about 15 words, the trigram estimate gains a clear advantage.

To situate our results, the FOMs used by (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) require 10K edges to parse 96% of these sentences, while BF requires only 6K edges. $$$$$ The authors are very grateful to Heidi Fox for obtaining the speed vs. accuracy data discussed in Appendix C.

Therefore, we were less concerned with improving efficiency, and more with the properties of this algorithm, which we consider a baseline method upon which more sophisticated techniques such as best-first parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ Some figure of merit is needed by which to compare the likelihood of constituents, and the choice of this figure has a substantial impact on the efficiency of the parser.
Therefore, we were less concerned with improving efficiency, and more with the properties of this algorithm, which we consider a baseline method upon which more sophisticated techniques such as best-first parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ An alternative way to rewrite the &quot;ideal&quot; figure of merit is as follows: Once again applying the usual independence assumption that given a nonterminal, the tag sequence it generates depends only on that nonterminal, we can rewrite the figure of merit as follows: To derive an estimate of this quantity for practical use as a figure of merit, we make some additional independence assumptions.

Similar to a best-first parser (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998), the highest scored hypothesis is expanded first. $$$$$ We can derive a similar estimate using context on both sides of the constituent as follows: Once again applying the usual independence assumption that given a nonterminal, the tag sequence it generates depends only on that nonterminal and also assuming that the probability of t depends only on the previous tags, we can rewrite the figure of merit as follows: Now we add some new independence assumptions.

For efficiency reasons, we use a coarse-to-fine pruning scheme like that of Caraballo and Charniak (1998). $$$$$ Second, when we consider only the two conditional-probability models, we can see that the additional information obtained from context in the prefix estimate gives a substantial improvement in this measure as compared to the trigram estimate.

The standard methods of the best analysis selection (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) usually use simple stochastic functions independent on the peculiarities of the underlying language. $$$$$ For each edge e in E' we compute the product of cti, of the nonterminal appearing on the left-hand pc, side (lhs) of the rule, the probability of the rule itself, and 13 of each nonterminal Ks appearing to the left of NI hk in the rule.
