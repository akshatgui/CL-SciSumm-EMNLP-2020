The (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) article considers a number of different figures of merit for ordering the agenda, and ultimately recommends one that reduces the number of edges required for a full parse into the thousands. $$$$$ A simple extension to the normalized 0 model allows us to estimate the perword probability of all tags in the sentence through the end of the constituent under consideration.

The (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) article considers a number of different figures of merit for ordering the agenda, and ultimately recommends one that reduces the number of edges required for a full parse into the thousands. $$$$$ For this experiment, we used the probabilistic context-free grammar learned from the Brown corpus and the average-length test sentences described in Section 5.4.

(Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and [Gold98] use a figure which indicates the merit of a given constituent or edge, relative only to itself and its children but independent of the progress of the parse we will call this the edge's independent merit (IM). $$$$$ Here, for the best-first parsers, we will use for convenience the time needed to get 95% of the sentence's total probability mass.

(Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and [Gold98] use a figure which indicates the merit of a given constituent or edge, relative only to itself and its children but independent of the progress of the parse we will call this the edge's independent merit (IM). $$$$$ Recall is defined as the percentage of constituents in the treebank test data that are found by our parser.

 $$$$$ These updates can be quite expensive in terms of CPU time.
 $$$$$ Magerman and Marcus (1991) use the geometric mean to compute a figure of merit that is independent of constituent length.
 $$$$$ Best-first parsing methods for natural language try to parse efficiently by considering the most likely constituents first.
 $$$$$ The results for the figures of merit introduced in the previous section according to the measurements given in Section 2.2 are shown in Table 3.

 $$$$$ (This improvement comes later than in the edge count statistics because of the small additional amount of overhead work needed to use the trigram estimate.)
 $$$$$ We will refer to this figure as the left boundary trigram estimate.
 $$$$$ We can also obtain the count C(ti_i) simply by counting the number of sentences in which that tag appears in position j - 1.
 $$$$$ This figure has the additional advantage that it can be easily incorporated into existing best-first parsers using a figure of merit based on inside probability.

Again it is reminiscent of a best-first parser (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) in the use of an agenda and a chart, but is fundamentally different due to the fact that there is no input order. $$$$$ While several parsers described in the literature have used such techniques, there is little published data on their efficacy, much less attempts to judge their relative merits.

Again it is reminiscent of a best-first parser (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) in the use of an agenda and a chart, but is fundamentally different due to the fact that there is no input order. $$$$$ Since precision is not a useful measure, we have not included precision data for these figures of merit.

 $$$$$ We also derived an estimate of the ideal figure of merit that takes advantage of statistics on the first j â€” 1 tags of the sentence as well as ti,k.
 $$$$$ The treebank grammar is much larger and more ambiguous than our original grammar, containing about 16,000 rules and 78 terminal and nonterminal symbols, and it was impractical to parse sentences to exhaustion using our existing hardware, so the figures based on 95% of the probability mass could not be computed.
 $$$$$ Since we use the tags as our input, the probability of a nonterminal appearing with a particular previous tag is the same as the probability of that nonterminal appearing in any sentence containing that tag.
 $$$$$ For this experiment, we used the probabilistic context-free grammar learned from the Brown corpus and the average-length test sentences described in Section 5.4.

Best-first parsers deal with this by allowing an upward propagation, which updates such edges' scores (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ We can then count the probability-weighted occurrences of a nonterminal given the previous tag as follows: That is, for each sentence that contains the previous tag tj_i, we increment our count by the probability of the nonterminal Nk occurring immediately following ti_i in that sentence.

To situate our results, the FOMs used by (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) require 10K edges to parse 96% of these sentences, while BF requires only 6K edges. $$$$$ The edge-count percentages were generally within .01 of their final values after processing only 200 sentences, so the results were quite stable by the end of our 500-sentence test corpus.
