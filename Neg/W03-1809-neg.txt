Bannard et al (2003) extended this research in looking explicitly at the task of classifying verb-particles as being compositional or not. $$$$$ They measure the cosine between the vector representation for the candidate MWE and a weighted vector sum of its component words, suggesting that a small cosine would indicate compositionality.

Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ We then implemented four different techniques and showed that they offer a significant improvement over a naive approach.

Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ Verb-particle constructions (hereafter referred to as VPCs) consist of a head verb and one or more obligatory particles, in the form of intransitive prepositions (e.g. hand in), adjectives (e.g. cut short) or verbs (e.g. let go) .
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ The first of these loosely followed Lin in measuring the extent to which the component verb or particle of any VPC could be replaced with items of a similar semantic class to form a corpusattested VPC; WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) was used as the source for verb substitution candidates, and a hand-build semantic taxonomy for particles.

They are also extremely diverse $$$$$ We created a set of gold-standard data, based on non-expert judgements acquired via a web-based experiment.
They are also extremely diverse $$$$$ As with any corpus-based approach to lexical semantics, our study of VPCs is hampered by polysemy, e.g. carry outTRANSin the execute and transport out (from a location) senses.'
They are also extremely diverse $$$$$ In addition to the binary compositional/non-compositional judgement that Lin offers (which seems to be equivalent to TASK 1), we tested the method over the other three tasks.
They are also extremely diverse $$$$$ We selected the English verb-particle construction as our test case MWE in this paper.

Note that although Lin characterizes his work as detecting non-compositionality, we agree with Bannard et al (2003) that it is better thought of as tapping into productivity.plore whether the light verbs themselves show different patterns in terms of how they are used semi productively in these constructions. $$$$$ In order to test the effects of polysemy in the example sentences on inter-annotator agreement, we analysed the agreement obtained over those VPCs which have only one meaning according to WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).

Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully com positional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ As such it describes the development of a resource for implementing and evaluating statistical models of MWE meaning, based on nonexpert human judgements.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully com positional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ A (partial) Parsons-style semantic analysis of this might be as follows: Sentence (4), on the other hand requires a rather different analysis.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully com positional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ That is, the verb and the particle make independent contributions to the sentence.

Bannard et al (2003), on the other hand, look at the separate contribution of the verb and particle, but assume that a binary decision on the compositionality of each is sufficient. $$$$$ So as to avoid introducing any bias into the experiment through artificially-generated sentences, we chose to extract the sentences from naturallyoccurring text, namely the written component of the British National Corpus (BNC, Burnard (2000)).

 $$$$$ Finally, we ran a stochastic chunk-based grammar over the chunker output to extend extraction coverage to include mistagged particles and also more reliably determine the valence of the VPC.
 $$$$$ For (2), it is not true that either Susan or the paper were up, and the VPC therefore does not entail the particle.
 $$$$$ The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
 $$$$$ We created a set of gold-standard data, based on non-expert judgements acquired via a web-based experiment.

They do not fall cleanly into mutually exclusive classes, but populate the continuum between the two extremes (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ However, (3) and (4) produce a rather different result.

Possible alternatives for dealing with this issue are discussed by both Bannard et al (2003) and McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ We can see then that the best classifiers perform only marginally below the upper bound on at least two of the tasks.
Possible alternatives for dealing with this issue are discussed by both Bannard et al (2003) and McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ The semantic representation of multiword expressions (MWEs) has recently become the target of renewed attention, notably in the area of hand-written grammar development (Sag et al., 2002; Villavicencio and Copestake, 2002).

Bannard et al (2003) tested techniques using statistical models to infer the meaning of verb-particle constructions (VPCs), focus 2 In this lexicon, many MWEs are encoded as templates,. $$$$$ We mapped the gold-standard data onto four binary (yes/no) classification tasks over VPC items: Note the partial conditional chaining between these tests, e.g. an item for which the verb and particle contribute their simplex meaning (i.e. positive exemplars for TASKS 3 and 4) is completely compositional (i.e. a positive exemplar for TASK 1).

 $$$$$ The following sections describe four methods for modelling VPC compositionality, each of which is tested over the 4 individual compositionality classification tasks.
 $$$$$ The results in Table 4 show that on all tasks (for the majority-view based data and three out of four for the centroid data), at least one of the four statistical methods offers an improvement in precision over the baseline, and that there is an improvement in F-score for TASK 1 on both sets of data.
 $$$$$ These are only very slightly higher than the overall scores, suggesting, although by no means proving, that polysemy was not a significant confounding factor.
 $$$$$ One property they try and pick up on in doing so is non-compositionality.
