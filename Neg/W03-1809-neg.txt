Bannard et al (2003) extended this research in looking explicitly at the task of classifying verb-particles as being compositional or not. $$$$$ Baldwin et al. used LSA to calculate the distributional similarity between an MWE and its head word, and demonstrate a correlation between similarity and compositionality (modelled in terms of endocentricity) by way of items with higher similarity being more compositional.
Bannard et al (2003) extended this research in looking explicitly at the task of classifying verb-particles as being compositional or not. $$$$$ In order to test the effects of polysemy in the example sentences on inter-annotator agreement, we analysed the agreement obtained over those VPCs which have only one meaning according to WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).
Bannard et al (2003) extended this research in looking explicitly at the task of classifying verb-particles as being compositional or not. $$$$$ The following sections describe four methods for modelling VPC compositionality, each of which is tested over the 4 individual compositionality classification tasks.

Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ On TASK 3, Method 2 achieved the highest classification accuracy at .600, and on TASK 4, Method 4 achieved a classification accuracy of .675.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ While there has been some work on statistical approaches to the semantics of compositional compound nominals (e.g.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ This paper describes a distributional approach to the semantics of verb-particle (e.g.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ The results for each method are given in Table 4, in which the baseline for each task is the score obtained when we assign the most frequent label to all items.

They are also extremely diverse: for example ,onthe semantic dimension alone, MWEs cover an en tire spectrum, ranging from frozen, fixed idioms to free combinations of words (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ We report first on a framework for implementing and evaluating such models.

Note that although Lin characterizes his work as detecting non-compositionality, we agree with Bannard et al (2003) that it is better thought of as tapping into productivity.plore whether the light verbs themselves show different patterns in terms of how they are used semi productively in these constructions. $$$$$ There are swings in the relative scores obtained over the majority as compared to centroid annotator data for a given task.

Bannard (2005), extending work by Bannard et al (2003), instead considers the extent to which the verb and particle each contribute semantically to the VPC. $$$$$ On TASK 3, Method 2 achieved the highest classification accuracy at .600, and on TASK 4, Method 4 achieved a classification accuracy of .675.

Bannard (2005), extending work by Bannard et al (2003), instead considers the extent to which the verb and particle each contribute semantically to the VPC. $$$$$ In our implementation we replaced Linâ€™s collocations with our VPCs, treating the relationship between a verb and a particle as a kind of grammatical relation.
Bannard (2005), extending work by Bannard et al (2003), instead considers the extent to which the verb and particle each contribute semantically to the VPC. $$$$$ We created a set of gold-standard data, based on non-expert judgements acquired via a web-based experiment.

Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully com positional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ We then implemented four different techniques and showed that they offer a significant improvement over a naive approach.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully com positional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ In terms of relative performance, the semantic similarity based approach of Methods 3 and 4 outperform the distribution based approach of Methods 1 and 2 in terms of F-score, on 6 of the 8 sets of results reported.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully com positional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ They were all native speakers of English, recruited by advertisements posted to newsgroups and mailing lists.

Bannard et al (2003), on the other hand, look at the separate contribution of the verb and particle, but assume that a binary decision on the compositionality of each is sufficient. $$$$$ This is similar to the assumption made in Schone and Jurafsky (2001), except that we make a distinction between the contribution of the different component parts.
Bannard et al (2003), on the other hand, look at the separate contribution of the verb and particle, but assume that a binary decision on the compositionality of each is sufficient. $$$$$ Semantically, they often cannot be understood through the simple composition of their independent parts.
Bannard et al (2003), on the other hand, look at the separate contribution of the verb and particle, but assume that a binary decision on the compositionality of each is sufficient. $$$$$ The unique challenge posed by MWEs for empirical NLP is precisely that they do not fall cleanly into the binary classes of compositional and non-compositional expressions, but populate a continuum between the two extremes.

 $$$$$ We therefore replicated the approach described in Lin (1998a) to build the thesaurus, using BNC data and including prepositions.
 $$$$$ The assumption that non-compositionality is requisite for the presence of a MWE in a dictionary, while interesting, is not well-founded, and hence it does not seem to us that the poor results reflect a failure of the LSA approach in measuring compositionality.

They do not fall cleanly into mutually exclusive classes, but populate the continuum between the two extremes (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ The underlying intuition is that identifying the degree of semantic similarity between a VPC and its component verb and/or particle will indicate whether that component part contributes independent semantics.

Possible alternatives for dealing with this issue are discussed by both Bannard et al (2003) and McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ We calculated the similarity between two terms by finding the cosine of the angle between their vectors.
Possible alternatives for dealing with this issue are discussed by both Bannard et al (2003) and McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ Participants were advised that if they felt more that one meaning was present in the set of five sentences, they should base their decision on the sense that had the greatest number of occurrences in the set.

 $$$$$ We then go on to report on the implementation of some techniques for using statistical models acquired from corpus data to infer the meaning of verb-particle constructions.
 $$$$$ We observed significant correlations for a number of the regressions (notably all items vs. the centroid annotator, and monosemous items vs. 60% agreement).
 $$$$$ As a consequence of Philipâ€™s action the intruder is down, but since there is no simplex verb to gun, we would not say that anyone gunned or was gunned The semantic analysis is consequently as follows: gun down(e1, x, y) n philip(x) n intruder(y) n down(e1, y) In the linguistic literature, the semantics of VPCs is frequently viewed in rather more complicated terms than we are suggesting here, with particles often seen as making significant construction-specific contributions in terms of aspect (e.g.
