For instance, Teufel and Moens (2002) summarize scientific articles by selecting rhetorical elements that are commonly present in scientific abstracts. $$$$$ As we do not have much annotated material, cross-validation is a practical way to test as it can make use of the full development corpus for training, without ever using the same data for training and testing. substantial improvement over the baseline in terms of precision and recall of the important categories AIM, BACKGROUND, CONTRAST, and BASIS.

This requires adaptation of the high-level features used in AZ (Teufel and Moens, 2002) to chemistry. $$$$$ Sparck Jones (1999) argues that it is crucial for a summarization strategy to relate the large-scale document structure of texts to readers’ tasks in the real world (i.e., to the proposed use of the summaries).

Previous work on rhetorical analysis of scientific articles focus on either; 1) hierarchical discourse relations between sentences (e.g. Mann and Thompson, 1987), 2) genre analysis within a descriptive framework (e.g. Swales 1990), or 3) ZI in a flat structure and a statistical evaluation of the annotation scheme from a machine learning perspective (e.g. Teufel and Moens, 2002). $$$$$ Another important construct that expresses relations to other researchers’ work is formal citations, to which we will now turn.

As these schemes are too fine grained for abstracts (some of the categories do not appear in abstracts at all), we adopt a reduced version of AZ which integrates seven categories from (Teufel and Moens, 2002) and (Mizuta et al, 2005) those which actually appear in abstracts. $$$$$ Also, the verbs are very different (base, be related, use, follow).
