Our methodology builds and extends the Teufel and Moens (Teufel and Moens, 2002) approach to automatic summarisation. $$$$$ On Landis and Koch’s (1977) more forgiving scale, agreement of .0–.2 is considered as showing “slight” correlation, .21–.4 as “fair,” .41–.6 as “moderate,” .61– 0.8 as “substantial,” and .81 –1.0 as “almost perfect.” According to these guidelines, our results can be considered reliable, substantial annotation.

Our methodology builds and extends the Teufel and Moens (Teufel and Moens, 2002) approach to automatic summarisation. $$$$$ As our immediate goal is to select important content from a text, we also need a second set of gold standards that are defined by relevance (as opposed to rhetorical status).

It is also similar conceptually to content selection algorithms that have been used for text summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002) and text generation (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009), both of which rely on finding highly-relevant passages within source texts. $$$$$ The authors would like to thank Jean Carletta for her help with the experimental design, Chris Brew for many helpful discussions, Claire Grover and Andrei Mikheev for advice on the XML implementation, and the annotators, Vasilis Karaiskos and Anne Wilson, for their meticulous work and criticism, which led to several improvements in the annotation scheme.

Related to this is the work by Teufel and Moens (2002) on rhetorical classification for content selection. $$$$$ We provide a gold standard for summaries of this kind consisting of a substantial corpus of conference articles in computational linguistics annotated with human judgments of the rhetorical status and relevance of each sentence in the articles.
