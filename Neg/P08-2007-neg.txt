More recently, DeNero and Klein (2008) have proven the NP-completeness of the phrase alignment problem. $$$$$ Since SAT is NPcomplete and our construction requires only polynomial time, we conclude that D is NP-complete.2 SAT: Given vectors of boolean variables v = (v) and propositional clauses3 C = (C), decide whether there exists an assignment to v that simultaneously satisfies each clause in C. For a SAT instance (v, C), we construct f to contain one word for each clause, and e to contain several copies of the literals that appear in those clauses. φ scores only alignments from clauses to literals that satisfy the clauses.
