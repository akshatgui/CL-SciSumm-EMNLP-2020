Our view of relations in a concept network being the interpretations of metonymies is strongly reminiscent of older work in metonymy resolution such as Hobbs et al1993), Fass (1991), Markert and Hahn (2002) or the use of a generative lexicon. $$$$$ The second component of CS is the process of collation.

Wilks (1978) advocates that the typically hard constraints that define a literal semantics should instead be modeled as soft preferences that can accommodate the violations that arise in metaphoric utterances, while Fass (1991) builds on this view to show how these violation scan be repaired to thus capture the literal intent be hind each metaphor. $$$$$ The left side of Figure 20 shows the knowledge representation part of the sentence representation: a simple case-frame based representation of (20).

One of the first attempts to identify and interpret metaphorical expressions in text automatically is the approach of Fass (1991). $$$$$ Gibbs (1984, p. 275) concludes that the distinction between literal and metaphoric meanings has &quot;little psychological validity.&quot; Among AT researchers, Martin (1990) shares many of Gibbs's views in criticizing the &quot;literal meaning first approach&quot; (ibid., p. 24).

Fass (1991) developed a system called met*, capable of discriminating between literalness, metonymy, metaphor and anomaly. $$$$$ Regarding the problem that &quot;everything shares some feature or category... with everything else,&quot; CS is in agreement: the only significant combination of features in a metaphor are those involved in a relevant analogy.

For example, 'the rock is becoming brittle with age' (Reddy, 1969, p. 242), has "a literal interpretation when uttered about a stone and a metaphorical one when said about a decrepit professor emeritus" (Fass, 1991, p. 54). $$$$$ In the met* method, literalness is distinguished because it satisfies contextual constraints that the nonliteral others all violate.
