In his program, (Fass 1991) makes use of formal definitions of several kinds of metonymic relations. $$$$$ &quot;The ham sandwich is waiting for his check.&quot; For example, in (2) the metonymy is that the concept for ham sandwich is related to an aspect of another concept, for &quot;the person who ordered the ham sandwich.&quot; Several attempts have been made to organize instances of metonymy into categories (e.g., Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Stern 1931; Yamanashi 1987) or &quot;metonymic concepts,&quot; as Lakoff and Johnson call them.

Our view of relations in a concept network being the interpretations of metonymies is strongly reminiscent of older work in metonymy resolution such as Hobbs et al1993), Fass (1991), Markert and Hahn (2002) or the use of a generative lexicon. $$$$$ The problem that &quot;the most obvious shared features are often irrelevant,&quot; i.e., that the most obvious shared features are irrelevant to a metaphor, is borne out by experience with CS — for example, animals and cars share some basic physical objectlike properties, but these have a minor role in understanding cars drinking.

 $$$$$ Some examples of meta5's analysis of metaphor and metonymy are given.
 $$$$$ Metonymy is discriminated from metaphor and anomaly in a way that [1] supports Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) view that in metonymy one entity stands for another whereas in metaphor one entity is viewed as another, [2] permits chains of metonymies (Reddy 1979), and [3] allows metonymies to co-occur with instances of either literalness, metaphor, or anomaly.

 $$$$$ Metaphor is distinguished from anomaly because the former contains a relevant analogy, unlike the latter.

Fass (Fass, 1991) uses selectional preference violation technique to detect metaphors. $$$$$ Regarding the first difference, I would argue that the difference is a mistaken one and that interaction theorists are simply using a sophisticated form of comparison.

Wilks (1978) advocates that the typically hard constraints that define a literal semantics should instead be modeled as soft preferences that can accommodate the violations that arise in metaphoric utterances, while Fass (1991) builds on this view to show how these violation scan be repaired to thus capture the literal intent be hind each metaphor. $$$$$ Metonymy interpretation has been investigated only for adjective-noun and subject-verb-object constructions; metaphor interpretation, only for the latter.

One of the first attempts to identify and interpret metaphorical expressions in text automatically is the approach of Fass (1991). $$$$$ In metaphor, an aspect of one concept is similar to an aspect of another concept; e.g., in (1), an aspect of the concept for animal, that animals drink potable liquids, is similar to an aspect of another concept, that cars use gasoline.

For example, 'the rock is becoming brittle with age' (Reddy, 1969, p. 242), has "a literal interpretation when uttered about a stone and a metaphorical one when said about a decrepit professor emeritus" (Fass, 1991, p. 54). $$$$$ The right side of Figure 20, within the grey partition, is the coherence representation component of the sentence representation: abridged semantic vectors for the two main semantic dependencies in (20).

Almost simultaneously with the work of Fass (1991),. $$$$$ In Section 2, two main differences were noted between the interaction and comparison views: first, that similarities are &quot;created&quot; in the interaction view, whereas only pre-existing similarities are found in the comparison view, and second, that a whole system of similarities are evoked in the interactions view, unlike the comparisons view, which focuses upon finding a single similarity.

A similar path-finding methodology for deriving metonymies was used by the met* system (Fass, 1991), in which connections between the sense frames of textual concepts are retrieved from a lexicon of the size of 500 word senses. $$$$$ The above analysis also illustrates, I hope, why metonymy and metaphor are easily confused: both are nonliteral and are found through the discovery of some aspect (a property) shared by the source, a preference, and the target, in the above case a surface noun.
