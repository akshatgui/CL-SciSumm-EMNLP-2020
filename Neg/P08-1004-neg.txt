The information extraction oeuvre has a gamut of relation extraction methods for entities like persons, organizations, and locations, which can be classified as open or closed-domain depending on the restrictions on extractable relations (Banko and Etzioni, 2008). $$$$$ This section contrasts the performance of O-CRF with that of O-NB on an Open IE task, and shows that O-CRF achieves both double the recall and increased precision relative to O-NB.
