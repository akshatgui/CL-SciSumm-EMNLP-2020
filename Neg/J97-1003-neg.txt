This similarity is computed by applying in the style of Hearst (1997) a cosine-based metric on the morphed segments. $$$$$ If the token is a stop word then it is not passed on to the next 8 &quot;Stop list&quot; is a term commonly used in Information Retrieval (Salton 1989).

Foltz et al's (1998) approach is in line with the earlier TextTiling method that identifies subtopic structure in text (Hearst, 1997). $$$$$ This formulation allows the interface to reflect each conceptual part of the query: the medical terms, the diagnosis terms, and the software terms.
Foltz et al's (1998) approach is in line with the earlier TextTiling method that identifies subtopic structure in text (Hearst, 1997). $$$$$ Thus if there are k sentences within a block, each sentence occurs in k *2 score computations (except for sentences at the extreme ends of the text).

Table 1 also presents the performance of a typical topic segmentation algorithm, TextTiling (Hearst, 1997). $$$$$ In the block comparison algorithm, adjacent pairs of blocks of tokensequences are compared for overall lexical similarity.
Table 1 also presents the performance of a typical topic segmentation algorithm, TextTiling (Hearst, 1997). $$$$$ Because the goal is to partition texts into contiguous, nonoverlapping subtopic segments, I call the general approach TextTiling (Hearst, 1993, 1994a, 1994b).1 Subtopic discussions are assumed to occur within the scope of one or more overarching main topics, which span the length of the text.

Many researchers have attempted to make use of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993), especially for segmentation both in prose (Hearst, 1997) and conversation (Galley et al, 2003). $$$$$ One way to evaluate the algorithm is in terms of how well it distinguishes entire articles from one another when they are concatenated into one file.
Many researchers have attempted to make use of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993), especially for segmentation both in prose (Hearst, 1997) and conversation (Galley et al, 2003). $$$$$ The algorithm has three parts: tokenization into terms and sentence-sized units, determination of a score for each sentence-sized unit, and detection of the subtopic boundaries, which are assumed to occur at the largest valleys in the graph that results from plotting sentence-units against scores.
Many researchers have attempted to make use of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993), especially for segmentation both in prose (Hearst, 1997) and conversation (Galley et al, 2003). $$$$$ As in the block version of the algorithm, the score is plotted at the token-sequence gap, and scores can range from 0 to 1, inclusive.

Pairwise mean kappa scores were calculated by comparing a coder's segmentation against a reference segmentation formulated by the majority opinion strategy used in Passonneau and Litman (1993, p. 150) (Hearst, 1997, pp. 53-54). $$$$$ Internal numbers indicate location of gaps between paragraphs; x-axis indicates token-sequence gap number, y-axis indicates judge number, a break in a horizontal line indicates a judge-specified segment break.

Coders often disagree in segmentation tasks (Hearst, 1997, p. 56), making it improbable that a single, correct, reference segmentation could be identified from human codings. $$$$$ This work, along with that of Nomoto and Nitta (1994), on Japanese, and Hasnah (1996), on Arabic, also provides evidence that TextTiling is applicable to a wide range of natural languages.

This category choice is similar to those chosen by Hearst (1997, p. 53), who computed chance agreement in terms of the probability that coders would say that a segment boundary exists (segt), and the probability that they would not (unsegt). $$$$$ Youmans' goal is to study the distribution of vocabulary in discourse rather than to segment it along topical lines, but upon examining many English narratives, essays, and transcripts he notices that sharp upturns after deep valleys in the curve &quot;correlate closely to constituent boundaries and information flow&quot; (p. 788).

Finally, score(r) — score(i) is added to score(1) — score(i), and the result is the depth score at i.

Automatic segmentation of discourse forms the basis for many applications, from information retrieval and text summarisation to anaphora resolution (Hearst, 1997). $$$$$ Brown and Yule (1983, 140) state that this kind of division is one of the most basic in discourse.

While agreement among annotators regarding linear segmentation has been found to be higher than 80% (Hearst, 1997), with respect to hierarchical segmentation it has been observed to be as low as 60% (Flammia and Zue, 1995). $$$$$ As one safeguard, the algorithm uses smoothing (described below) to help eliminate small perturbations of the kind seen at 174.

So far, it has been used mainly in the context of automatic text segmentation, where a change in vocabulary is often the mark of topic change (Hearst, 1997), and, to a lesser extent, in discourse studies (see, e.g., (Foltz et al, 1998)). $$$$$ More formally, for a given token-sequence gap i, the program records the lexical score of the token-sequence gap 1 to the left of i until the score for 1 — 1 is smaller than the score for 1 (meaning the top of the peak was found at 1).
