 $$$$$ After defining the similarity measure in one domain, the similarity between two verb meanings, e. g, a target verb and a source verb, can be defined as a summation of weighted similarities between pairs of simpler concepts in each of the domains the two verbs are projected onto.
 $$$$$ A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT.
 $$$$$ Therefore, we propose a novel method for defining verbs based on a set of shared semantic domains.
 $$$$$ The translations from English verbs to Chinese verb compounds that we present here provide evidence of the reference to the context and to a fine-grained level of semantic representation.

 $$$$$ Four hundred Brown corpus sentences which contain these 21 English verbs have been selected, Among them, 100 sentences with concrete objects are used as training samples.
 $$$$$ Selection restrictions on verb arguments can only define default situations for verb events, and are often overridden by context information.
 $$$$$ This representation scheme not only takes care of the semantic-syntactic correspondence, but also provides similarity measures for the system for the performance of inexact matches based on verb meanings.
 $$$$$ For test set one, the lexical selection of the system got a correct rate 57.8% before encoding the meaning of the unknown verb arguments; and a correct rate 99.45% after giving the unknown English words conceptual meanings in the system's conceptual hierarchy.
