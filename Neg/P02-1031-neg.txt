Gildea and Palmer (2002) achieve a recall of 0.50, a precision of 0.58, and an F-measure of 0.54 when using the full parser of Collins (1999). $$$$$ In particular, sentential complements (which comprise 11% of the data) and prepositional phrases (which comprise 10%) always correspond to more than one chunk, and therefore cannot be correctly labeled by our system which assigns roles to single chunks.

 $$$$$ Among such systems, (Hobbs et al., 1997) built finite-state recognizers for various entities, which were then cascaded to form recognizers for higher-level relations, while (Ray and Craven, 2001) used low-level &quot;chunks&quot; from a general-purpose syntactic analyzer as observations in a trained Hidden Markov Model.
