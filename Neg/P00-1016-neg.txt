(Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000) and (Ngai, 2001) provide a thorough description of many experiments involving rule-based systems and statistical learners for NP bracketing. $$$$$ Although several systems have recently achieved slightly higher published results (Munoz et al. : 92.8, Tjong Kim Sang & Veenstra: 92.37, XTAG Research Group: 92.4), their algorithms are significantly more costly, or not feasible, to implement in an active learning framework.
(Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000) and (Ngai, 2001) provide a thorough description of many experiments involving rule-based systems and statistical learners for NP bracketing. $$$$$ Sets of 50 sentences were selected because it takes approximately 15-30 minutes for humans to annotate them, a reasonable amount of work and time for the annotator to spend before taking a break while the machine selects the next set.

Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) investigated the effectiveness of rule-writing versus annotation (using active learning) for chunking, and found the latter to be far more effective. $$$$$ In general, these methods calculate the usefulness of an example by first having the learner classify it, and then seeing how uncertain that classification was.

Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) investigated the effectiveness of rule-writing versus annotation (using active learning) for chunking, and found the latter to be far more effective. $$$$$ This section will analyze and compare the performance of systems constructed with hand-built rules with systems that were trained from data selected during real-time active learning.
Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) investigated the effectiveness of rule-writing versus annotation (using active learning) for chunking, and found the latter to be far more effective. $$$$$ Results show that it is more efficient and more successful by several measures to train a system using active learning annotation rather than hand-crafted rule writing at a comparable level of human labor investment.

Another relatively early work in our field along these lines was the work of Ngai and Yarowsky (2000), which measured actual times of annotation to compare the efficacy of rule writing versus annotation with AL for the task of BaseNP chunking. $$$$$ A significant amount of work has been done in this domain and many different methods have been applied: Church's PARTS (1988) program used a Markov model; Bourigault (1992) used heuristics along with a grammar; Voutilainen's NPTool (1993) used a lexicon combined with a constraint grammar; Juteson and Katz (1995) used repeated phrases; Veenstra (1998), Argamon, Dagan & Krymolowski (1998), Daelemans, van den Bosch & Zavrel (1999) and Tjong Kim Sang & Veenstra (1999) used memory-based systems; Ramshaw & Marcus (1999) and Cardie & Pierce (1998) used rule-based systems, Munoz et al.
