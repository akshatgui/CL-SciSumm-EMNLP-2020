Wellington et al. (2006) reports that discontinuities are very useful for translational equivalence analysis using binary branching structures under word alignment and parse tree constraints while they are almost of no use if under word alignment constraints only. $$$$$ This freedom in word choice reduced the frequency of cognates and thus imposed fewer constraints on the hierarchical alignment, which resulted in looser estimates of the lower bounds.
