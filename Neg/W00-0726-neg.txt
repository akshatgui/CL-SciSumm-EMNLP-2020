Unlike the shallow phrases defined for the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), base phrases correspond directly to constituents that appear in full parses, and hence can provide a straightforward constraint on edges within a chart parser. $$$$$ The CoNLL-2000 shared task attempts to fill this gap.
