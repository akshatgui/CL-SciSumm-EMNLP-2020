This data set was used for CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ We will give a global description of the various chunk types in the next section.

Text chunking consists of dividing text into syntactically related non overlapping groups of words (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ These phrases are non-overlapping which means that one word can only be a member of one chunk Here is an example sentence: [NP He ] [vp reckons ] [NP the current account deficit] [vp will narrow] [pp to [NP only 1.8 billion] [pp in] [NP September] .

Text chunking consists of dividing text into syntactically related non overlapping groups of words (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Conjunctions can consist of more than one word as well: as well as, instead of, rather than, not only, but also.

Unlike the shallow phrases defined for the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), base phrases correspond directly to constituents that appear in full parses, and hence can provide a straightforward constraint on edges within a chart parser. $$$$$ Other chunk types have not received the same attention as NP chunks.

For the chunker, we ran fnTBL over the lemmatised tagged data, training over CoNLL 2000 style (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) chunk converted versions of the full Brown and WSJ corpora. $$$$$ This is the case with fixed multi-word prepositions such as such as, because of, due to, with prepositions preceded by a modifier: well above, just after, even in, particularly among or with coordinated prepositions: inside and outside.
