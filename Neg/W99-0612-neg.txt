Some have assumed only partially tagged training corpora (Merialdo, 1994), while others have begin with small tagged seed word lists (such as Collins and Singer (1999) and Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) for named-entity tagging). $$$$$ Before describing the algorithm, we will present a brief overview of some of its goals: Three important concepts are used in our model: 2.1 Trie structures are used for both morphological and contextual information Tries provide an effective, efficient and flexible data structure for storing both contextual and morphological patterns and statistics.
Some have assumed only partially tagged training corpora (Merialdo, 1994), while others have begin with small tagged seed word lists (such as Collins and Singer (1999) and Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) for named-entity tagging). $$$$$ A simpler model can use just one parameter (setting /3 = an), but this has limited flexibility in optimizing the hierarchical inheritance - the probability of a class given the first letter is often not very informative for some languages (such as English or Romanian) or, by contrast, may be extremely important for others (e.g.

The bootstrapping methods for language independent NER of Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) have a similar effect. $$$$$ Each distribution also has two standard classes, named &quot;questionable&quot; (unassigned probability mass in terms of entity classes, to be motivated below) and &quot;non-entity&quot;.
The bootstrapping methods for language independent NER of Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) have a similar effect. $$$$$ The basic concept of this bootstrapping procedure is to iteratively leverage relatively independent sources of information.

Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) exploit morphological and contextual patterns to propose a language-independent solution to NER. $$$$$ The combination of relatively independent morphological and contextual evidence sources in an iterative bootstrapping framework converges upon a successful named entity recognizer, achieving a competitive 70.5%-75.4% F-measure (measuring both named entity identification and classification) when applied to Romanian text.
Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) exploit morphological and contextual patterns to propose a language-independent solution to NER. $$$$$ Because approximately 96% of words in the Hindi text are not named entities, without additional orthographic clues the prior probability for &quot;non-entity&quot; is so strong that the morphological or contextual evidence in favor of one of the named entity classes must be very compelling to overcome this bias.

Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) built a cross language NER, and the performance on English was low compared to supervised single-language NER such as Identi Finder. $$$$$ Configuration (c) used the default parameters, but the more conservative &quot;dominant&quot; criterion was utilized, clearly favoring precision at the expense of recall.

Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) built a cross language NER, and the performance on English was low compared to supervised single-language NER such as Identi Finder. $$$$$ Beginning with some seed names for each class, the algorithm learns contextual patterns that are indicative for those classes and then iteratively learns new class members and word-internal morphological clues.

It has been previously attempted by Cucerzan and Yarowsky in their language independent NER work which used morphological and contextual evidences (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999). $$$$$ We consider this to be a plausible lower bound measure if the training words have not been selected from the test text.

It has been previously attempted by Cucerzan and Yarowsky in their language independent NER work which used morphological and contextual evidences (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999). $$$$$ Another significant performance measure is forced classification accuracy, where the entities have been previously identified in the text and the only task is selecting their name class.

We can also exploit what Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) call the one sense per discourse phenomenon, the tendency of terms to have a fixed meaning within a single document. $$$$$ Japanese).
We can also exploit what Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) call the one sense per discourse phenomenon, the tendency of terms to have a fixed meaning within a single document. $$$$$ Moreover, he claims that the number of instances of the new entity is not associated with the document length but with the importance of the entity with regard to the subject/discourse.

 $$$$$ Identifying and classifying personal, geographic, institutional or other names in a text is an important task for numerous applications.
 $$$$$ Fixed k-way classification accuracy on given entities ranges between 73%-79% on 5 diverse languages for a difficult firstname/lastname/place partition, and approaches 92% accuracy for the simpler person/place discrimination.

Both (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) and (Collins and Singer, 1999) present algorithms to obtain NEs from untagged corpora. $$$$$ What should be underlined here is that these systems were trained for a specific domain and a particular language (English), typically making use of hand-coded rules, taggers, parsers and semantic lexicons.

The NER task for Hindi has been explored by Cucerzan and Yarowsky in their language independent NER work which used morphological and contextual evidences (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999). $$$$$ The algorithm learns from unannotated text and achieves competitive performance when trained on a very short labelled name list with no other required language-specific information, tokenizers or tools.
The NER task for Hindi has been explored by Cucerzan and Yarowsky in their language independent NER work which used morphological and contextual evidences (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999). $$$$$ When analyzing large texts, a segmentation phase should be considered, so that all the instances of a name in a segment have a high probability of belonging to the same class, and thus the contextual information for all instances within a segment can be used jointly when making a decision.

Tries have previously been used in both supervised (Patrick et al, 2002) and unsupervised (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) named entity recognition. $$$$$ These can be estimated from the 3 training wordlists (150-300 words total), but without an independent source of information (e.g. context) via which bootstrapping can iterate, there is no available path by which these models can learn the behaviour of previously unseen affixes and conquer new territory.
Tries have previously been used in both supervised (Patrick et al, 2002) and unsupervised (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) named entity recognition. $$$$$ These results were achieved using only unannotated training texts, with absolutely no required language-specific information, tokenizers or other tools, and requiring no more than 15 minutes total human effort in training (for short wordlist creation) The observed robust and consistent performance and very rapid, low cost rampup across 5 quite different languages shows the potential for further successful and diverse applications of this work to new languages and domains.
Tries have previously been used in both supervised (Patrick et al, 2002) and unsupervised (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) named entity recognition. $$$$$ Thus the model is entirely static on just the initial training data.

Earlier papers have taken a character-level approach to named entity recognition (NER), notably Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999), which used prefix and suffix tries, though to our knowledge incorporating all character grams is new. $$$$$ The decision with regard to the presence of an entity and its classification is made by combining them.

The bootstrapping stage (5) uses the initial or current entity assignments to estimate the class conditional distributions for both entities and contexts along their trie paths, and then re-estimates the distributions of the contexts/entity-candidates to which they are linked, recursively, until all accessible nodes are reached, as presented in Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999). $$$$$ Such morphological information is automatically learned during bootstrapping.
