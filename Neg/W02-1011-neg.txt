Sentiment classification is a special task of text classification whose objective is to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains (Pang et al, 2002), e.g., favorable or unfavorable, positive or negative. $$$$$ As a rough approximation to determining this kind of structure, we tagged each word according to whether it appeared in the first quarter, last quarter, or middle half of the document14.

For the purpose of this work, we follow the definition of Pang et al (2002) and Turney (2002) and consider a binary classification task for output labels as positive and negative. $$$$$ Past work on sentiment-based categorization of entire documents has often involved either the use of models inspired by cognitive linguistics (Hearst, 1992; Sack, 1994) or the manual or semi-manual construction of discriminant-word lexicons (Huettner and Subasic, 2000; Das and Chen, 2001; Tong, 2001).

We choose to use SVM since it performs the best for sentiment classification (Pang et al, 2002). $$$$$ One might also suspect that there are certain words people tend to use to express strong sentiments, so that it might suffice to simply produce a list of such words by introspection and rely on them alone to classify the texts.

Much of this research explores sentiment classification, a text categorization task in which the goal is to classify a document as having positive or negative polarity (e.g., Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al (2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al (2003), Pang and Lee (2004)). $$$$$ Fi,c is a feature/class function for feature fi and class c, defined as follows:6 class c. The parameter values are set so as to maximize the entropy of the induced distribution (hence the classifier’s name) subject to the constraint that the expected values of the feature/class functions with respect to the model are equal to their expected values with respect to the training data: the underlying philosophy is that we should choose the model making the fewest assumptions about the data while still remaining consistent with it, which makes intuitive sense.
