The low recall for adjective POS based synsets can be detrimental to classification since adjectives are known to express direct sentiment (Pang et al, 2002). $$$$$ On the other hand, it seems that distinguishing positive from negative reviews is relatively easy for humans, especially in comparison to the standard text categorization problem, where topics can be closely related.

The low recall for adjective POS based synsets can be detrimental to classification since adjectives are known to express direct sentiment (Pang et al, 2002). $$$$$ Despite its simplicity and the fact that its conditional independence assumption clearly does not hold in real-world situations, Naive Bayes-based text categorization still tends to perform surprisingly well (Lewis, 1998); indeed, Domingos and Pazzani (1997) show that Naive Bayes is optimal for certain problem classes with highly dependent features.
The low recall for adjective POS based synsets can be detrimental to classification since adjectives are known to express direct sentiment (Pang et al, 2002). $$$$$ Note that bigrams and unigrams are surely not conditionally independent, meaning that the feature set they comprise violates Naive Bayes’ conditional-independence assumptions; on the other hand, recall that this does not imply that Naive Bayes will necessarily do poorly (Domingos and Pazzani, 1997).
