This score is used, for instance, in the collocation compiler XTract (Smadja, 1993) and in the lexicon extraction system Champollion (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ Surprisingly, we found that with moderate values of a (close to 1) this method gives a very low failure rate even for high final threshold values, and is preferable to using a constant but lower threshold just to reduce the failure rate.

Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem of collocation identification, we may say that we are more interested in precision than recall (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ Then, each corpus is separately run through a partof-speech tagger and noun phrase recognizer.
Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem of collocation identification, we may say that we are more interested in precision than recall (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ As shown in Maarek and Smadja (1989) and more recently in Broglio et al. (1995), the precision of information retrieval systems can be improved through the use of collocations in addition to the more traditional single word indexing units.
Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem of collocation identification, we may say that we are more interested in precision than recall (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ Our goal is to provide a tool for compiling bilingual lexical information above the word level in multiple languages, for different domains.
Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem of collocation identification, we may say that we are more interested in precision than recall (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ Finally, a quick look at a bilingual dictionary, even for two widely studied languages such as English and French, shows that correspondences between collocations in two languages are largely unexplored.

This highlights the need for finding multi-word translation correspondences. Previous works that focus on multi-word translation correspondences from parallel corpora include noun phrase correspondences (Kupiec, 1993), fixed flexible collocations (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ By applying Champollion to a corpus in a new domain, translations for the domain-specific collocations can be automatically compiled and inaccurate results filtered by a native speaker of the target language.

Our preliminary finding supports the work on collocation by Smadja et al (1996) in that gapped sequences are also an important class of multi-word translations. $$$$$ Their system, Termight, first extracts candidate technical terms, presenting them to a terminologist for filtering.
Our preliminary finding supports the work on collocation by Smadja et al (1996) in that gapped sequences are also an important class of multi-word translations. $$$$$ Since determining the thresholds is the only training required for our statistical method, using the same corpus as both the database and the source of input collocations is not a case of testing on the training data.
Our preliminary finding supports the work on collocation by Smadja et al (1996) in that gapped sequences are also an important class of multi-word translations. $$$$$ For this scenario, when a translator begins work on a collocation inside a translation editor, the translation produced by Champollion could be provided as a prompt giving the translator the opportunity to approve it.

Smadja et al (1996) limits to find French translation of English collocation identified by his Xtract system. $$$$$ Note that these problems are quite similar to the difficulties in translating technical terminology, which also is usually part of a particular technical sublanguage (Dagan and Church 1994).
Smadja et al (1996) limits to find French translation of English collocation identified by his Xtract system. $$$$$ In the current implementation of Champollion, we were restricted to using tools for only one of the two languages, since at the time of implementation tools for French were not readily available.

The relationship between pointwise Mutual Information and the Dice coefficient is also discussed in (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ Since some information extraction systems, such as General Electric's NLToolset (Jacobs and Rau 1990), already produce similar representations for Japanese and English news articles, the addition of an English summary generator will automatically allow for English summarization of Japanese.
The relationship between pointwise Mutual Information and the Dice coefficient is also discussed in (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ But, given the many possible groups of words that can appear in each sentence, the fact that neither of two groups of words appears in a pair of aligned sentences does not offer any information about their similarity.
The relationship between pointwise Mutual Information and the Dice coefficient is also discussed in (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ Canadian family is another example; it is often translated as famille (the Canadian qualifier is dropped in the French version).
The relationship between pointwise Mutual Information and the Dice coefficient is also discussed in (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ In Section 9, we describe a later version of Champollion in which we added the capability to identify these types of closed-class words during the last stage.

A number of corpus-based methods to extract bilingual lexicons have been proposed (Smadja et al,1996). $$$$$ More precisely, for a given source collocation, Champollion initially identifies a set S of k words that are highly correlated with the source collocation.
A number of corpus-based methods to extract bilingual lexicons have been proposed (Smadja et al,1996). $$$$$ Collocations are notoriously difficult for non-native speakers to translate, primarily because they are opaque and cannot be translated on a word-by-word basis.
A number of corpus-based methods to extract bilingual lexicons have been proposed (Smadja et al,1996). $$$$$ Published translations of such collocations are not readily available, even for languages such as French and English, despite the fact that collocations have been recognized as one of the main obstacles to second language acquisition (Leed and Nakhimovsky 1979).

 $$$$$ We wish to thank Pascale Fung and Dragomir Radev for serving as evaluators, Thanasis Tsantilas for discussions relating to the average-case complexity of Champollion, and the anonymous reviewers for providing useful comments on an earlier version of the paper.
 $$$$$ While they also align groups of words across languages in the process of translation, they are careful to point out that such groups may or may not occur at constituent breaks in the sentence.
 $$$$$ These systems also need access to bilingual phrases.

Commonly used association measures are the Mutual Information (Fano, 1961) and the Dice factor (Smadja et al 1996). $$$$$ For interlingua systems, identification of collocations and their translations provide a means of augmenting the interlingua.
Commonly used association measures are the Mutual Information (Fano, 1961) and the Dice factor (Smadja et al 1996). $$$$$ Testing Champollion on three years' worth of the Hansards corpus yielded the French translations of 300 collocations for each year, evaluated at 73% accuracy on average.
Commonly used association measures are the Mutual Information (Fano, 1961) and the Dice factor (Smadja et al 1996). $$$$$ An additional direction for future experiments is to vary the thresholds (and especially the frequency threshold Tf) according to the size of the database corpus and the frequency of the collocation being translated.
Commonly used association measures are the Mutual Information (Fano, 1961) and the Dice factor (Smadja et al 1996). $$$$$ For example, employment equity is translated as equite en matiere d' emploi with prepositions in place of the empty slots shown in Table 8 on page 27.

 $$$$$ Another potential application, as demonstrated by Dagan and Church (1994), is machine-aided human translation.
 $$$$$ We reduced the effects of low frequencies by purposefully limiting ourselves to source collocations of frequencies higher than 10, containing individual words with frequencies higher than 15.
 $$$$$ Instead, a speaker must be aware of the meaning of the phrase as a whole in the source language and know the common phrase typically used in the target language.
 $$$$$ In this section we describe some of them and we give possible directions for future research.

Our method is similar to that of Smadja et al (1996), except that we incorporate lexical-level information into the association-based method. $$$$$ This is appropriate in the context of communications for which mutual information was originally developed (Shannon 1948), where the ones and zeros encode two different states with no special preference for either of them.
