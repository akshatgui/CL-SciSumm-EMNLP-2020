Riezler et al (2007) define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem. $$$$$ Both SMT-based techniques take the entire query context into account when adding new terms to the original query.
Riezler et al (2007) define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem. $$$$$ SMT-based query expansion is done by i) using a full-sentence paraphraser to introduce synonyms in context of the entire query, and ii) by translating query terms into answer terms using a full-sentence SMT model trained on question-answer pairs.
Riezler et al (2007) define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem. $$$$$ After stopword removal, the average number of expansion terms produced was 7.8 for paraphrasing, and 3.1 for question-answer translation.

With the exception of the query expansion approaches (Riezler et al, 2007), all works discussed here use some form of noisy-channel model (translation model and target language model) but do not perform the decoding part of the SMT process to generate translations, nor use the rich set of features of a full SMT. $$$$$ We present an approach to query expansion in answer retrieval that uses Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to bridge the lexical gap between questions and answers.
