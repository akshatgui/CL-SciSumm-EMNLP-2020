Recently (Riezler et al, 2007) used statistical machine translation for query expansion and took a step towards bridging the lexical gap between questions and answers. $$$$$ QA has approached the problem of the lexical gap by various techniques for question reformulation, including rule-based syntactic and semantic reformulation patterns (Hermjakob et al., 2002), reformulations based on shared dependency parses (Lin and Pantel, 2001), or various uses of the WordNet ontology to close the lexical gap word-by-word (Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001).

Riezler et al (2007) define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem. $$$$$ Since not all those pages are actually FAQs, we manually labeled 1,000 of those pages to train an online passiveaggressive classificier (Crammer et al., 2006) in a 10-fold cross validation setup.
Riezler et al (2007) define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem. $$$$$ We evaluate these global, context-aware query expansion techon from 10 million question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ pages.

With the exception of the query expansion approaches (Riezler et al, 2007), all works discussed here use some form of noisy-channel model (translation model and target language model) but do not perform the decoding part of the SMT process to generate translations, nor use the rich set of features of a full SMT. $$$$$ Despite the small-scale nature of our current experimental results, we hope to apply the presented techniques to general web retrieval in future work.
