Literature on automatic relation discovery (Fader et al, 2011) has shown that verbal phrases uncover a large fraction of binary predicates while reducing the amount of noisy phrases that do not denote any relations. $$$$$ The lexical constraint provides a significant boost in performance, with REVERB achieving an AUC 23% higher than REVERB—Lex.
Literature on automatic relation discovery (Fader et al, 2011) has shown that verbal phrases uncover a large fraction of binary predicates while reducing the amount of noisy phrases that do not denote any relations. $$$$$ Open IE solves this problem by identifying relation phrases—phrases that denote relations in English sentences (Banko et al., 2007).
Literature on automatic relation discovery (Fader et al, 2011) has shown that verbal phrases uncover a large fraction of binary predicates while reducing the amount of noisy phrases that do not denote any relations. $$$$$ Thus, as we show in Section 5, systems such as TEXTRUNNER are unable to learn the constraints embedded in REVERB.

To this end, we used a random sample from the large scale web-based ReVerb corpus (Fader et al, 2011), comprising tuple extractions of predicate templates with their argument instantiations. $$$$$ Other approaches to large-scale IE have included Preemptive IE (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), OnDemand IE (Sekine, 2006), and weak supervision for IE (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2010).

To this end, we used a random sample from the large scale web-based ReVerb corpus (Fader et al, 2011), comprising tuple extractions of predicate templates with their argument instantiations. $$$$$ Our work differs from these approaches by focusing on relation phrase patterns expressed in terms of POS tags and NP chunks, instead of full parse trees.

Two example systems implementing this paradigm are TEXTRUN NER (Yates et al, 2007) and REVERB (Fader et al, 2011). $$$$$ It is natural, then, to consider whether the combination of heuristically labeled training examples, CRF learning, and our constraints will result in superior performance.

To that end, we applied the methods on a set of one billion extractions (generously provided by Fader et al (2011)) automatically extracted from the ClueWeb09 web crawl, where each extraction comprises a predicate and two arguments. $$$$$ In contrast, REVERB uses a specified model of relations for extraction, and requires labeled data only for assigning confidence scores to its extractions.

To that end, we applied the methods on a set of one billion extractions (generously provided by Fader et al (2011)) automatically extracted from the ClueWeb09 web crawl, where each extraction comprises a predicate and two arguments. $$$$$ The POS pattern will match the phrase: is offering only modest greenhouse gas reduction targets at (1) Thus, there are phrases that satisfy the syntactic constraint, but are not relational.

 $$$$$ The phrase for assumed is clearly not a valid relation phrase: it begins with a preposition and splices together two distant words in the sentence.
 $$$$$ In summary, this paper articulates two simple but surprisingly powerful constraints on how binary relationships are expressed via verbs in English sentences, and implements them in the REVERB Open IE system.
 $$$$$ Of course, a learning system, utilizing a different hypothesis space, and an appropriate set of training examples, could potentially learn and refine the constraints in REVERB.
 $$$$$ Finally, the extractor chooses an extraction’s arguments heuristically, and cannot backtrack over this choice.
