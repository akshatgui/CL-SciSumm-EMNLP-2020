We have implemented the Greedy Agreement Algorithm (Abney, 2002) which, based on two independent views of the data, is able to learn two binary classifiers from a set of hand-typed seed rules. $$$$$ Thus, given the precision of an arbitrary rule G, we can compute the precision of any otherview rule F. Then we can compute the precision of rules based on the same view as G by using the precision of some other-view rule F. Hence we can compute the precision of every rule given the precision of any one.
