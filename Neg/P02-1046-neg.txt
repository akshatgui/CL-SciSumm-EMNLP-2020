In recent work, (Abney, 2002) shows that the independence assumption can be relaxed, and co-training is still effective under a weaker independence assumption. $$$$$ Because not all test instances are labeled (some are neither persons nor locations nor organizations), and because classifiers do not label all instances, we show precision and recall rather than a single error rate.
In recent work, (Abney, 2002) shows that the independence assumption can be relaxed, and co-training is still effective under a weaker independence assumption. $$$$$ We have also given a theoretical analysis of the Yarowsky algorithm for the first time, and shown that it can be justified by an independence assumption that is quite distinct from the independence assumption that co-training is based on.

However, as theoretically shown in (Abney, 2002), and then empirically in (Clark et al,2003), co-training still works under a weaker independence assumption, and the results we obtain concur with these previous observations. $$$$$ This addresses one of the shortcomings of the original co-training paper: it gives a proof that justifies searching for classifiers that agree on unlabeled data.

Rather than comparing the two learners on whether they categorically select the same preferred parse on a number of examples, we can view active learning as the inverse of agreement-based co-training (Abney, 2002). $$$$$ Intuitively, the Yarowsky algorithm increases recall while holding precision above a threshold that represents the desired precision of the final classifier.
