In natural language learning, co-training was applied to statistical parsing (Sarkar, 2001), reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2003), part of speech tagging (Clark et al., 2003), and others, and was generally found to bring improvement over the case when no additional unlabeled data are used. $$$$$ We also produce a more embellished parse in which phenomena such as predicate-argument structure, subcategorization and movement are given a probabilistic treatment.

The other approach, and the focus of this paper, is co-training (Sarkar, 2001), a mostly unsupervised algorithm that replaces the human by having two (or more) parsers label training examples for each other. $$$$$ The approach uses the notion of tree rewriting as defined in the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) formalism (Joshi and Schabes, 1992)1 which retains the notion of lexicalization that is crucial in the success of a statistical parser while permitting a simple definition of tag dictionary.
