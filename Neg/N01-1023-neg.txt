Co-training (Sarkar, 2001) and classifier combination (Nivre and McDonald, 2008) are two technologies for training improved dependency parsers. $$$$$ By explicitly representing these two steps independently, we can pursue independent statistical models for each step: These two models have to agree with each other on the trees assigned to each word in the sentence.
Co-training (Sarkar, 2001) and classifier combination (Nivre and McDonald, 2008) are two technologies for training improved dependency parsers. $$$$$ In the initial runs we also limit the length of the sentences entered into the cache because shorter sentences are more likely to beat out the longer sentences in any case.

In natural language learning, co-training was applied to statistical parsing (Sarkar, 2001), reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2003), part of speech tagging (Clark et al., 2003), and others, and was generally found to bring improvement over the case when no additional unlabeled data are used. $$$$$ A history of the bi-lexical dependencies that define the probability model used to construct the parse is shown in Figure 3.

The other approach, and the focus of this paper, is co-training (Sarkar, 2001), a mostly unsupervised algorithm that replaces the human by having two (or more) parsers label training examples for each other. $$$$$ During the iterations we set the beam size to a value which is likely to prune out all derivations for a large portion of the cache except the most likely ones.
The other approach, and the focus of this paper, is co-training (Sarkar, 2001), a mostly unsupervised algorithm that replaces the human by having two (or more) parsers label training examples for each other. $$$$$ There is a useful approximation for Pinit: Pr(T, w, pjtop = 1) ti Pr(labeljtop = 1) where label is the label of the root node of T. where N is the number of bracketing labels and a is a constant used to smooth zero counts.

Feature-based integration also has points in common with co-training, which have been applied to syntactic parsing by Sarkar (2001) and Steedman et al. $$$$$ Once the words in a sentence have selected a set of elementary trees, parsing is the process of attaching these trees together to give us a consistent bracketing of the sentences.
