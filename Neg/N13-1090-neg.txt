However, not only are these techniques intractable to train with high-order context vectors, they also lack the neural network's ability to semantically generalize (Mikolov et al, 2013) and learn nonlinear relationships. $$$$$ For example, take the ClassInclusion:Singular Collective relation with the prototypical word pair clothing:shirt.
However, not only are these techniques intractable to train with high-order context vectors, they also lack the neural network's ability to semantically generalize (Mikolov et al, 2013) and learn nonlinear relationships. $$$$$ In this method, we assume relationships are present as vector offsets, so that in the embedding space, all pairs of words sharing a particular relation are related by the same constant offset.

While all the previous data sets are relatively standard in the DSM field to test traditional count models, our last benchmark was introduced in Mikolov et al (2013a) specifically to test predict models. $$$$$ We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset.

Note however that, because of the way the task is framed, performance also depends on the size of the vocabulary to be searched $$$$$ For example, if we denote the vector for word i as xi, and focus on the singular/plural relation, we observe that x apple−xapples ≈ xcar−xcars, xfamily−xfamilies ≈ xcar−xcars, and so on.
Note however that, because of the way the task is framed, performance also depends on the size of the vocabulary to be searched $$$$$ This has been used to good effect, for example in (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010) where induced word representations are used with sophisticated classifiers to improve performance in many NLP tasks.

Word embeddings have been empirically shown to preserve linguistic regularities, such as the semantic relationship between words (Mikolov et al, 2013b). $$$$$ We note that this measure is qualitatively similar to relational similarity model of (Turney, 2012), which predicts similarity between members of the word pairs (xb, xd), (x,-, xd) and dis-similarity for (xa, xd).
