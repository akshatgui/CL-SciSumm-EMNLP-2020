This contribution has been built based on the data released for the Quality Estimation task of the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) 2012 (Callison-Burch et al, 2012). $$$$$ The merit of the M5P Regression Trees is that it provides compact models that are less prone to overfitting.

The two-scale scoring for adequacy and fluency used in NIST evaluation has been abandoned by some evaluation campaigns, most notably the WMT shared task series, see Koehn and Monz (2006) through Callison-Burch et al (2012) 1. $$$$$ A few variations of the training data were provided, including version with cases restored and a version detokenized.

Callison-Burch et al (2012) report for several automatic metrics on the whole WMT12 English-to-Czech dataset, the best of which correlates at?= 0.18. $$$$$ We introduced a new quality estimation task this year, and evaluated submissions from 11 teams.
Callison-Burch et al (2012) report for several automatic metrics on the whole WMT12 English-to-Czech dataset, the best of which correlates at?= 0.18. $$$$$ We used the ranking of these systems to measure how strongly automatic metrics correlate with human judgments of translation quality for 12 evaluation metrics.

In line with our observation, Czech-to-English correlations reported by Callison-Burch et al (2012) are higher $$$$$ We conducted a large-scale manual evaluation of 103 machine translation systems submitted by 34 teams.

On the other hand, it is quite possible that the WMT-style rankings taken as the gold standard are of a disputable quality themselves, see Section 3.1 or the detailed report on inter annotator agreement and a long discussion on interpreting the rankings in Callison-Burch et al (2012). $$$$$ However, the two types of ranking lead to significantly different outcomes.

It is possible that Callison-Burch et al (2012) use some what different METEOR settings apart from the different subset of the data. $$$$$ Manual evaluation is time consuming, and it requires a large effort to conduct on the scale of our workshop.
It is possible that Callison-Burch et al (2012) use some what different METEOR settings apart from the different subset of the data. $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).

Nevertheless, in the context of this Quality Evaluation Shared task (see (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) for a detailed description) we have also used supervised learning as a final stage, in order to submit results which can be compared to other methods (see? 4). We investigate the use of various similarity measures for evaluating the quality of machine translated sentences. $$$$$ A second difference is that this year we no longer include comparisons against reference translations.

The TCD-M5P-resources-only submission ranked 5th (among 17) in the ranking task, and 5th among 19 (tied with two other systems) in the scoring task (Callison-Burch et al, 2012). Unfortunately the TCD-M5P-all submission contained an error.13 Below are the official results for TCD-M5P-resources-only and the corrected results for TCD-M5P-all $$$$$ Structured learning techniques were successfully used by the “UU” submissions – the second best performing team – to represent parse trees.

The WMT 2012 shared task on QE for MT (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) required participants to score and rank a set of automatic English to Spanish translations output by a state of-the-art phrase based machine translation system. $$$$$ Although the translations were done professionally, we observed a number of errors.
The WMT 2012 shared task on QE for MT (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) required participants to score and rank a set of automatic English to Spanish translations output by a state of-the-art phrase based machine translation system. $$$$$ Some judges tend to give more moderate scores (in the middle of available range), while others like to commit also to scores that are more in the extremes of the available range.
The WMT 2012 shared task on QE for MT (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) required participants to score and rank a set of automatic English to Spanish translations output by a state of-the-art phrase based machine translation system. $$$$$ To ensure we had enough data to measure agreement, we occasionally showed annotators items that were repeated from previously completed items.
The WMT 2012 shared task on QE for MT (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) required participants to score and rank a set of automatic English to Spanish translations output by a state of-the-art phrase based machine translation system. $$$$$ As the metrics produce absolute scores, compared to five relative ranks in the human assessment, it would be potentially unfair to the metric to count a slightly different metric score as discordant with a tie in the relative human rankings.

An analysis of the Pearson correlation of the baseline features (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) with human quality assessments shows that the two strongest individual predictors of post-editing effort are the n-gram language model perplexities estimated on source and target sentences. $$$$$ In our case, this happens randomly, say, 1:A, 2:B, 3:C, 4:D (for simplicity’s sake).
An analysis of the Pearson correlation of the baseline features (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) with human quality assessments shows that the two strongest individual predictors of post-editing effort are the n-gram language model perplexities estimated on source and target sentences. $$$$$ We argue that since the HTER metric is considered a good approximation for the effort required in post-editing, effort-like scores derived from the HTER score provide a good way to compute oracle scores in a deterministic manner.
An analysis of the Pearson correlation of the baseline features (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) with human quality assessments shows that the two strongest individual predictors of post-editing effort are the n-gram language model perplexities estimated on source and target sentences. $$$$$ It would thus be useful to have some measure of confidence in the quality of the output, which has potential usefulness in a range of settings, such as deciding whether output needs human post-editing or selecting the best translation from outputs from a number of systems.
