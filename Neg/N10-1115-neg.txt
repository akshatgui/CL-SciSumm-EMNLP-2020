 $$$$$ Beam search can be incorporated into our parser as well.
 $$$$$ This means that in case of relative clauses such as “I saw the boy [who ate the pizza] with my eyes”, the parser must decide if the PP “with my eyes” should be attached to “the pizza” or not before it is allowed to build parts of the outer NP (“the boy who... ”).
 $$$$$ Our non-directional parser addresses these deficiencies by discarding the strict left-to-right processing order, and attempting to make easier decisions before harder ones.
