Our initial experiments with the integration of GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997), the evolving German version of WordNet, seem to confirm the positive results described for WordNet (de Buenaga Rodriguez et al, 1997) and will thus be extended. $$$$$ We use the Princeton WordNet technology for the database format, database compilation, as well as the Princeton WordNet interface, applying extensions only where necessary.

To divide adjectives into groups, Tsvetkov et al (2014) use 13 top-level classes from the adapted taxonomy of Hundsnurscher and Splett (1982), which is incorporated in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ It is compatible with the Princeton WordNet but integrates principlebased modifications on the constructional and organizational level as well as on the level of lexical and conceptual relations.

Synonyms in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) receive the score 1. $$$$$ The basic framework of GermaNet is similar to the Princeton WordNet (Miller et al., 1993), guaranteeing maximal compatibility.
Synonyms in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) receive the score 1. $$$$$ However, these two cases are quite distinct from each other, justifying their separation into two different relations in GermaNet.
Synonyms in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) receive the score 1. $$$$$ For example offnen (to open) causes offen (open).
Synonyms in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) receive the score 1. $$$$$ Furthermore, linguistic resources are becoming increasingly important as training and evaluation material for statistical methods.

GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) is a large lexical database, where words are associated with POS in formation and semantic sorts, which are organized in a fine-grained hierarchy. $$$$$ A number of proposals have been made for the representation of regular polysemy in the lexicon.
GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) is a large lexical database, where words are associated with POS in formation and semantic sorts, which are organized in a fine-grained hierarchy. $$$$$ The frames used in GermaNet differ from those in WordNet, and particle verbs as such are treated in WordNet at all.
GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) is a large lexical database, where words are associated with POS in formation and semantic sorts, which are organized in a fine-grained hierarchy. $$$$$ It is compatible with the Princeton WordNet but integrates principlebased modifications on the constructional and organizational level as well as on the level of lexical and conceptual relations.

For German, we address this issue by introducing two further types of features into our model based on the GermaNet resource (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ It is compatible with the Princeton WordNet but integrates principlebased modifications on the constructional and organizational level as well as on the level of lexical and conceptual relations.

 $$$$$ Nevertheless such a structuring is important because it captures semantic intuitions every speaker of German has and it groups verbs according to their semantic relatedness.
 $$$$$ Systematic crossclassification allows to capture this fine-grained distinction easily and in a principle-based way.
 $$$$$ This pointer is semantic and not morphological in nature because different morphological realizations can be used to denote derivations from different meanings of the same lemma (e.g. konventionell is related to Konvention (Regein des Umgangs) (social rule), while konventzonal is related to Konvention (juristischer Text) (agreement).
 $$$$$ This list is further tuned by using other available sources such as the CELEX German database.

This paper presents an algorithm for finding systematic polysemous classes in WordNet (Miller et al 1990) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg 1997) - a semantic database for German similar to WordNet. $$$$$ The relation of hyponymy ('is-a') holds for all word classes and is implemented in GermaNet as in WordNet, so for example Rotkehlchen (robin) is a hyponym of Vogel (bird).
This paper presents an algorithm for finding systematic polysemous classes in WordNet (Miller et al 1990) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg 1997) - a semantic database for German similar to WordNet. $$$$$ GermaNet provides frames for verb senses, rather than for lemmas, implying a full disambiguation of the CELEX complementation codes for GermaNet.

The system currently uses two different terminological onto logies WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) as chaining resources which have been mapped onto the database for mat. $$$$$ Each verb sense is linked to one or more syntactic frames which are encoded on a lexical rather than on a conceptual level.

We select the hyper parameters of our model using an independent development set, which we extract from the lexical resource GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ We use the Princeton WordNet technology for the database format, database compilation, as well as the Princeton WordNet interface, applying extensions only where necessary.

Thus they can be cut out on the interface level if the user wishes so.
