 $$$$$ An approximation to Labeled LDA is also shown to be competitive with a strong baseline (multiple one vs-rest SVMs) for multi-label classification.

 $$$$$ A first question we ask of Labeled LDA is how its topics compare with those learned by traditional LDA on the same collection of documents.
 $$$$$ In the sections that follow, we examine mechanisms by which Labeled LDA’s credit assignment mechanism can be utilized to help support browsing and summarizing tagged document collections.
 $$$$$ From that larger dataset, we selected uniformly at random four thousand documents that contained at least one of the 20 tags, and then filtered each document’s tag set by removing tags not present in our tag set.
 $$$$$ A third model, MM-LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), is not constrained to one label per document because it models each document as a bag of words with a bag of labels, with topics for each observation drawn from a shared topic distribution.

Modeling Tweets in a Latent Space $$$$$ This paper has introduced Labeled LDA, a novel model of multi-labeled corpora that directly addresses the credit assignment problem.
Modeling Tweets in a Latent Space $$$$$ Hence the model is same as traditional LDA, except the constraint that the topic prior α(d) is now restricted to the set of labeled topics X(d).
Modeling Tweets in a Latent Space $$$$$ In addition to providing automatic summaries of the words best associated with each tag in the corpus, Labeled LDA’s credit attribution mechanism can be used to augment the view of a single document with rich contextual information about the document’s tags.

Distant Supervision with Topic Models $$$$$ The projection step constitutes the deterministic step 6 in Table 1.
Distant Supervision with Topic Models $$$$$ In a traditional one-versus-rest Multinomial Naive Bayes model, a separate classifier for each label would be trained on all documents with that label, so each word can contribute a count of 1 to every observed label’s word distribution.
Distant Supervision with Topic Models $$$$$ By explicitly modeling the importance of each label in the document, Labeled LDA can effective perform some contextual word sense disambiguation, which suggests why L-LDA can outperform SVMs on the del.icio.us dataset.
