However, one interesting result came from extending the feature space with topics derived from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using similar methods to Ramage et al (2009). $$$$$ Steps 1 and 2—drawing the multinomial topic distributions over vocabulary )3k for each topic k, from a Dirichlet prior 77—remain the same as for traditional LDA (see (Blei et al., 2003), page 4).
However, one interesting result came from extending the feature space with topics derived from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using similar methods to Ramage et al (2009). $$$$$ L-LDA and multiple one-vs-rest SVMs were trained on the first 80% of documents and evaluated on the remaining 20%, with results averaged across 10 random permutations of the dataset.

 $$$$$ The difference between these scores was highly significant (p < .001) by the sign test.
 $$$$$ Next, we define the vector of document’s labels to be X(d) = {k|Λ(d) k = 1}.
 $$$$$ Figure 2 shows the top words associated with 20 topics learned by Labeled LDA and 20 topics learned by unsupervised LDA on the del.icio.us document collection.
 $$$$$ But because the document as a whole is more about design than programming(incorporating words not shown here), inferring the document’s topic-mixture θ enables L-LDA to correctly re-assign most words. that L-LDA correctly infers that most of the words in this passage have more to do with design than programming.

 $$$$$ In addition to providing automatic summaries of the words best associated with each tag in the corpus, Labeled LDA’s credit attribution mechanism can be used to augment the view of a single document with rich contextual information about the document’s tags.
 $$$$$ In fact, the higher probability for the tag more than makes up the difference in the likelihood for all the words except “CMS” (Content Management System), so underline) words are generated from the design tag; red (dashed underline) from the programming tag.
 $$$$$ Labeled LDA’s topics are directly named with the tag that corresponds to each topic, an improvement over standard practice of inferring the topic name by inspection (Mei et al., 2007).
 $$$$$ In contrast to many existing text datasets, our tagged corpus is highly multiply labeled: almost 90% of of the documents have more than one tag.

Labeled LDA (LLDA) (Ramage et al 2009a) can be used to solve this problem. $$$$$ In a traditional one-versus-rest Multinomial Naive Bayes model, a separate classifier for each label would be trained on all documents with that label, so each word can contribute a count of 1 to every observed label’s word distribution.
