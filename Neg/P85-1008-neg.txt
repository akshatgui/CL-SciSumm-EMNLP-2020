Second, in keeping with ontological promiscuity (Hobbs, 1985), we represent the importance of attributes by the salience of events and states in the discourse model - these states and events now have the same status in the discourse model as any other entities. $$$$$ We are forced, though not unwillingly, into a position of individuating eventualities according to very fine-grained criteria.
Second, in keeping with ontological promiscuity (Hobbs, 1985), we represent the importance of attributes by the salience of events and states in the discourse model - these states and events now have the same status in the discourse model as any other entities. $$$$$ Since we are using only predicates, the uniqueness of the value of a function must be encoded with an axiom like (dz, y, z)father(z, z) A f ather(y, z) D z = y if: and y are both fathers of z, then z and y are the same.

Note that the predicate language representation utilized by Carmel-Tools is in the style of Davidsonian event based semantics (Hobbs, 1985). $$$$$ The first possibility is the approach of researchers who treat belief as an operator rather than as a predicate, and then re• strict substitution inside the operator?
Note that the predicate language representation utilized by Carmel-Tools is in the style of Davidsonian event based semantics (Hobbs, 1985). $$$$$ Substitution in referentially transparent contexts would be achieved by use of the axiom schema where es is the kth argument of p and p is referentially transparent in its kth argument.
Note that the predicate language representation utilized by Carmel-Tools is in the style of Davidsonian event based semantics (Hobbs, 1985). $$$$$ Axioms will express the fact that rw-identieal is an equivalence relation: Finally, the following axiom, together with axiom (17), would express Leibniz's Law: (Nies, es)rw-identical(63, es) 3 (Ezist(et ) n Ezist(e2)) From all of this we can prove that if the Evening Star rises then the Morning Star rises, but we cannot prove from John's belief that the Evening Star rises that John believes the Morning Star rises.

 $$$$$ This would have to be replaced by the axiom ('dz, y, z)father(z, z)A f ather(y, z) D rw-identical(z, y) The very common problems involving reasoning about equality, which can be done efficiently, are thus translated into problems involving reasoning about the predicate rw-identical, which is very cumbersome.
 $$$$$ There would be such an axiom for the first argument of believe but not for its referentially opaque second argument.
 $$$$$ This may seem counterintuitive, and even bizarre, at first blush.

 $$$$$ Although for a simple sentence like 'John runs&quot;, a logical form like (2) seems a bit overblown, when we come to real sentences in English discourse with their variety of tenses, modalities and adverbial modifiers, the more elaborated logical form is necessary.
