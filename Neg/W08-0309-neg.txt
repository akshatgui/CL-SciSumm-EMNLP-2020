Tests were run on the ACL WSMT 2008 test set (Callison-Burch et al, 2008). $$$$$ Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher value for p is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower p. Measuring sentence-level correlation under our human evaluation framework was made complicated by the fact that we abandoned the fluency and adequacy judgments which are intended to be absolute scales.
Tests were run on the ACL WSMT 2008 test set (Callison-Burch et al, 2008). $$$$$ We validate our manual evaluation methodology by measuring intraand inter-annotator agreement, and collecting timing information.

Spearman's rank correlation coefficients on the document (system) level between all the metrics and the human ranking are computed on the English, French, Spanish, German and Czech texts generated by various translation systems in the frame work of the third (Callison-Burch et al, 2008), fourth (Callison-Burch et al, 2009), fifth (Callison Burch et al, 2010) and sixth (Callison-Burch et al, 2011) shared translation tasks. $$$$$ Table 12 gives K values for inter-annotator agreement, and Table 13 gives K values for intraannotator agreement.

This increased the BLEU score by about 1 BLEU point in comparison to the results reported in the official evaluation (Callison-Burch et al, 2008). $$$$$ The svn-rank which had the lowest overall correlation at the system level does the best at consistently predicting the translations of syntactic constituents into other languages.
This increased the BLEU score by about 1 BLEU point in comparison to the results reported in the official evaluation (Callison-Burch et al, 2008). $$$$$ We presented them with five screens of sentence rankings, ten screens of constituent rankings, and ten screen of yes/no judgments.
This increased the BLEU score by about 1 BLEU point in comparison to the results reported in the official evaluation (Callison-Burch et al, 2008). $$$$$ This paper presents the results the shared tasks of the 2008 ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, which builds on two past workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007).
This increased the BLEU score by about 1 BLEU point in comparison to the results reported in the official evaluation (Callison-Burch et al, 2008). $$$$$ The interpretation of Kappa varies, but according to Landis and Koch (1977), 0−.2 is slight, .2 −.4 is fair, .4 −.6 is moderate, .6 −.8 is substantial and the rest almost perfect.
