Two main extensions from that work that we are making use of are $$$$$ 52-53; Pereira and Warren, 1983), it becomes possible to integrate syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in a very thorough and elegant way.a Below is a simple grammar written in Prolog style, but incorporating calls to local pragmatics.
Two main extensions from that work that we are making use of are $$$$$ In Section 3, we justify the last two clauses by describing our scheme of abductive inference.
Two main extensions from that work that we are making use of are $$$$$ The authors have profited from discussions with Todd Davies, John Lowrance, Stuart Shieber, and Mabry Tyson about this work.

The domain axioms will bind the body variables to their most likely referents during unification with facts, and previously assumed and proven propositions similarly to (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ An inspection is a looking at that causes one to learn a property relevant to the function of the inspected object.
The domain axioms will bind the body variables to their most likely referents during unification with facts, and previously assumed and proven propositions similarly to (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ The process of interpreting sentences in discourse can be viewed as the process of providing the best explanation of why the sentences would be true.

A third approach, exemplified by Moldovan et al (2003) and Raina et al (2005), is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasi-logical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ Its use in solving the local pragmatics problems of reference, compound nominals, syntactic ambiguity, and metonymy is described and illustrated.

As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ The research was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-85-C-0013.

As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ In addition to type checking, we have introduced two other techniques that are necessary for controlling the explosion--unwinding recursive axioms and making use of syntactic noncoreference information.

While pursuing the path tracing enabling minimal explanation, now we are going to propose a connectability measure similar such as "weighted abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988). $$$$$ The system got the correct interpretation, that the lube oil was the lube oil in the lube oil system of the air compressor, and it assumed that that lube oil was adequate.
