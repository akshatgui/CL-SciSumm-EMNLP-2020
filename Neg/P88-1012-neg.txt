Two main extensions from that work that we are making use of are: 1) proofs falling below a user defined cost threshold halt the search 2) a simple variable typing system reduces the number of axioms written and the size of the search space (Hobbs et al, 1988, pg 102). $$$$$ In any case, in our work, we are not buying into this notion that the universe is typed.

The domain axioms will bind the body variables to their most likely referents during unification with facts, and previously assumed and proven propositions similarly to (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ The syntax portion is represented in standard Prolog manner, with nonterminals treated as predicates and having as two of its arguments the beginning and end points of the phrase spanned by the nonterminal.
The domain axioms will bind the body variables to their most likely referents during unification with facts, and previously assumed and proven propositions similarly to (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ Accordingly, the aim of the TACITUS Project has been to investigate how knowledge is used in the interpretation of discourse.
The domain axioms will bind the body variables to their most likely referents during unification with facts, and previously assumed and proven propositions similarly to (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ To interpret a sentence: An approach to abductive inference developed in the TACITUS project has resulted in a dramatic simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized.
The domain axioms will bind the body variables to their most likely referents during unification with facts, and previously assumed and proven propositions similarly to (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ The fact that a variable occupies the second argument position of the predicate lube-oil' does not mean it is lube oil.

A third approach, exemplified by Moldovan et al (2003) and Raina et al (2005), is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasi-logical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ It also suggests an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ The authors have profited from discussions with Todd Davies, John Lowrance, Stuart Shieber, and Mabry Tyson about this work.
As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ It has been implemented in the TACITUS System (Stickel, 1982; Hobbs, 1986; Hobbs and Martin, 1987) and has been and is being used to solve a variety of interpretation problems in casualty reports, which are messages about breakdowns in machinery, as well as in other texts.1 It is well-known that people understand discourse so well because they know so much.
As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ Its use in solving the local pragmatics problems of reference, compound nominals, syntactic ambiguity, and metonymy is described and illustrated.
As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ The research was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-85-C-0013.

While pursuing the path tracing enabling minimal explanation, now we are going to propose a connectability measure similar such as "weighted abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988). $$$$$ In addition to type checking, we have introduced two other techniques that are necessary for controlling the explosion--unwinding recursive axioms and making use of syntactic noncoreference information.
