To compare relations in two instance sentences X, Y Culotta and Sorensen (2004) proposes to compare the subtrees induced by the relation arguments x 1, x 2 and y 1, y 2, i.e. computing the node kernel between the two lowest common ancestors (lca) in the dependecy tree of the relation argument nodes K DTK (X, Y)=? (lca (x 1, x 2) ,lca (y 1, y 2)). $$$$$ Formally, a relation instance is a dependency tree T with nodes It0 ... tn}.

 $$$$$ An improved system might use a different method to detect candidate relations and then use this kernel method to classify the relations.
 $$$$$ Intuitively, whenever we find a pair of matching nodes, we search for all matching subsequences of the children of each node.
 $$$$$ For two dependency trees T1, T2, with root nodes r1 and r2, we define the tree kernel K(T1, T2) as where Kc is a kernel function over children.
