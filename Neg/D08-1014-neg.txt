Banea et al (2008) use machine translation for multilingual sentiment analysis. $$$$$ As it was the case for Romanian, the SVM classifier produces the best results, with absolute improvements over the Naive Bayes classifier ranging from 0.2% to 3.5%.

Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored in Banea et al (2008b). $$$$$ A Naive Bayes classifier was then trained on the subjectivity annotated Romanian corpus and tested on the same gold standard as used in our experiments.

Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored in Banea et al (2008b). $$$$$ The second scenario, based on a corpus automatically annotated with a tool for subjectivity analysis, is subsequently divided into two experiments depending on the direction of the translation and on the dataset that is translated.

 $$$$$ Interestingly, the experiment conducted on Romanian shows an improvement of 3.5% to 9.5% over the results obtained on English, which indicates that subjective content may be easier to learn in Romanian versus English.
 $$$$$ The experiment is illustrated in Figure 1.
 $$$$$ We compare our results with those obtained by a previously proposed method that was based on the manual translation of the SemCor subjectivityannotated corpus.

A primary question is whether such lexicons improve performance over a translate-to-English strategy (Banea et al, 2008). $$$$$ Through comparative evaluations on two different languages (Romanian and Spanish), we show that automatic translation is a viable alternative for the construction of resources and tools for subjectivity analysis in a new target language.

Banea et al (2008) proposed several approaches for cross lingual subjectivity analysis by directly applying the translations of opinion corpus in source language to train the opinion classifier on target language. $$$$$ In all three experiments, we use English as a source language, given that it has both a corpus manually annotated for subjectivity (MPQA (Wiebe et al., 2005)) and a tool for subjectivity analysis (OpinionFinder (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005)).
