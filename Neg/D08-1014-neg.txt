Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored in Banea et al (2008b). $$$$$ In this paper, we explored the use of machine translation for creating resources and tools for subjectivity analysis in other languages, by leveraging on the resources available in English.

Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored in Banea et al (2008b). $$$$$ Through comparative evaluations on two different languages (Romanian and Spanish), we show that automatic translation is a viable alternative for the construction of resources and tools for subjectivity analysis in a new target language.
Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored in Banea et al (2008b). $$$$$ Although research in other languages is increasing, much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data, mainly due to the large body of electronic resources and tools that are available for this language.

 $$$$$ Instead, the automatic annotations produced with a rule-based tool (OpinionFinder), relying on overt mentions of words in a subjectivity lexicon, seems to be more robust to translation, further resulting in better classification results.
 $$$$$ This is the same evaluation dataset as used in (Mihalcea et al., 2007).
 $$$$$ In this paper, we explore multiple paths that employ machine translation while leveraging on the resources and tools available for English, to automatically generate resources for subjectivity analysis for a new target language.
 $$$$$ Therefore, in this paper we explore a different approach where, instead of relying on manually translated parallel corpora, we use machine translation to produce a corpus in the new language.

Similar to the approach proposed in (Banea et al, 2008), Wan's method also uses machine translation to produced a labeled Chinese review corpus from the available labeled English review data. $$$$$ In this paper, we explored the use of machine translation for creating resources and tools for subjectivity analysis in other languages, by leveraging on the resources available in English.
Similar to the approach proposed in (Banea et al, 2008), Wan's method also uses machine translation to produced a labeled Chinese review corpus from the available labeled English review data. $$$$$ As shown in Table 1, this classifier has higher precision but lower recall as compared to the high-coverage classifier we used in our previous experiments.
Similar to the approach proposed in (Banea et al, 2008), Wan's method also uses machine translation to produced a labeled Chinese review corpus from the available labeled English review data. $$$$$ The agreement of the two annotators is 0.83% (κ = 0.67); when the uncertain annotations are removed, the agreement rises to 0.89 (κ = 0.77).

A primary question is whether such lexicons improve performance over a translate-to-English strategy (Banea et al, 2008). $$$$$ This could imply that a classifier cannot be so easily trained on the cues that humans use to express subjectivity, especially when they are not overtly expressed in the sentence and thus can be lost in the translation.

Banea et al (2008) use machine translation for multilingual sentiment analysis. $$$$$ In that work, we found that the projection of annotations across parallel texts can be successfully used to build a corpus annotated for subjectivity in the target language.

Mihalcea et al, (2007) and Banea et al, (2008) used machine translation technique to leverage English resources for analysis in Romanian and Spanish languages. $$$$$ Thus, the two classifiers used the same training data, the same test data, and the same subjectivity annotations, the only difference being the language used (English or Romanian).

Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored by Banea et al (Banea et al,2008b). $$$$$ Interestingly, the experiment conducted on Romanian shows an improvement of 3.5% to 9.5% over the results obtained on English, which indicates that subjective content may be easier to learn in Romanian versus English.

Another approach in obtaining subjectivity lexicons for other languages than English was explored by Banea et al (Banea et al,2008b). $$$$$ To build a test dataset, a native speaker of Spanish translated the gold standard of 504 sentences into Spanish.

 $$$$$ A large number of text processing applications have already employed techniques for automatic subjectivity analysis, including automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), tracking sentiment timelines in on-line forums and news (Lloyd et al., 2005; Balog et al., 2006), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).
 $$$$$ The results suggest that either a manually annotated dataset or an automatically annotated one can provide sufficient leverage towards building a tool for subjectivity analysis.
 $$$$$ Table 1 shows the performance of the two OpinionFinder classifiers as measured on the MPQA corpus (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).
 $$$$$ We use a manual translation of this corpus available in the target language.

Similarly, (Banea et al, 2008) propose a method based on machine translation to generate parallel texts, followed by a cross-lingual projection of subjectivity labels, which are used to train subjectivity annotation tools for Romanian and Spanish. $$$$$ The results of the two experiments exploring the portability to Spanish are shown in Table 4.

 $$$$$ Although we could have used a Spanish text to carry out a similar experiment, due to the fact that the dataset would have been different, the results would not have been directly comparable.

Figure 1 $$$$$ For this reason, a machine learning algorithm may not be able to identify the same amount of information on subjective content in an English versus a Romanian text.
Figure 1 $$$$$ To build a test dataset, a native speaker of Spanish translated the gold standard of 504 sentences into Spanish.
Figure 1 $$$$$ To exemplify, consider the following subjective sentence from the MPQA corpus, which does not include overt clues of subjectivity, but was annotated as subjective by the human judges because of the structure of the sentence: It is the Palestinians that are calling for the implementation of the agreements, understandings, and recommendations pertaining to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

translating a source language training corpus into target language and creating a corpus based system in target language (Banea et al, 2008). $$$$$ Our experiments have generated corpora of about 20,000 sentences annotated for subjectivity in Romanian and Spanish, which are available for download at http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Downloads, along with the manually annotated data sets.

translating a source language training corpus into target language and creating a corpus based system in target language (Banea et al, 2008). $$$$$ The baseline on this data set is 54.16%, represented by the percentage of sentences in the corpus that are subjective, and the upper bound (UB) is 71.83%, which is the accuracy obtained under the scenario where the test data is translated into the source language and then annotated using the high-coverage OpinionFinder tool.

Banea et al (2008) proposed several approaches for cross lingual subjectivity analysis by directly applying the translations of opinion corpus in source language to train the opinion classifier on target language. $$$$$ To evaluate our methods, we generate a Romanian training corpus annotated for subjectivity on which we train a subjectivity classifier, which is then used to label the test data.

As stressed in some work (Banea et al., 2008), researchers have shown that in sentiment analysis, an approach in two steps is often beneficial, in which we first distinguish objective from subjective texts, and then classify subjective texts depending on their polarity (Kim and Hovy, 2006). $$$$$ This work was partially supported by a National Science Foundation grant IIS#0840608.
