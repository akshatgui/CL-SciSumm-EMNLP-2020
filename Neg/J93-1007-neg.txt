Therefore, sublanguage techniques such as Sager (1981) and Smadja (1993) do not work. $$$$$ Kathy McKeown read earlier versions of this paper and was helpful in both the writing and the research.

 $$$$$ Collocations come in a large variety of forms.
 $$$$$ Depending on their interests and points of view, researchers have focused on different aspects of collocations.
 $$$$$ For example, in some cases, the words of a collocation must be adjacent, as in sentences 1-5 above, while in others they can be separated by a varying number of other words.

Schone & Jurafsky's results indicate similar results for log-likelihood & T-score, and strong parallelism among information-theoretic measures such as ChiSquared, Selectional Association (Resnik 1996), Symmetric Conditional Probability (Ferreira and Pereira Lopes, 1999) and the Z-Score (Smadja 1993). $$$$$ Part of this work has been done in collaboration with Bell Communication Research, and part of this work has been supported by DARPA grant NO0039-84-C-0165, by NSF grant IRT-84-51438, and by ONR grant NO0014-89-J-1782.

 $$$$$ In a 10 million—word corpus, with about 60,000 different words, there are about 3.6 x 109 possible bigrams, 2.16 x 1014 trigrams, and 3 x 1033 7-grams.
 $$$$$ A collocation as defined in their work is a pair of correlated words.
 $$$$$ For example, for sentence (10), there is a syntactic label for the bigram faced-test, but there is none for the bigram stock-returning.
 $$$$$ For example, out of the 10,000 expressions proposed each month, fewer than 400 are serious candidates for the OED, which represents a current rate of 4%.
