Figure 1: Lexical entries and a sample derivation in LUD Logical Form, QLF which also is a monotonic representation language for compositional semantics as discussed in (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ A rough summary is as follows:
Figure 1: Lexical entries and a sample derivation in LUD Logical Form, QLF which also is a monotonic representation language for compositional semantics as discussed in (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ Making a resolution to QLF only specifies when and how an expression should be evaluated during semantic derivation; it does not carry out that part of the derivation.

This led to the development of underspecified semantic representations (e.g. QLF, Alshawi and Crouch (1992) and MRS, Copestake et al (2005)) which are easier to produce from text without contextual inference but which can be further specified as necessary for the task being performed. $$$$$ Resolution is a formula (the 'referent' of the form expression), or is a meta-variable if the form expression is unresolved.

In contrast to statements of a fully specified logic in which denotations are typically taken to be functions from possible worlds to truth values (Montague, 1973), denotations of a statement in an under specified logic are typically taken to be relations between possible worlds and truth values (Alshawi and Crouch (1992), Alshawi (1996)). $$$$$ The paper describes how monotonic reference resolution and scoping can be carried out using a revised Quasi Logical Form (QLF) representation.

Secondly, monotonicity guarantees that interpretation algorithms can proceed incrementally, combining information from various sources in a nondestructive way (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ We will use the notation [[E]]m for the truth value of an expression E with respect to a model m (but will leave m implicit). m includes an interpretation function / for mapping constants and predicates into domain individuals and relations.

Secondly, monotonicity guarantees that interpretation algorithms can proceed incrementally, combining information from various sources in a nondestructive way (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ Since monotonic resolution does not carry out the final composition of meanings, but merely sets out conditions on how it is to take place, there is no need to unpick composed meanings and put them back together again.

First, a quasi logical form allows the under-specification of several types of information, such as anaphoric references, ellipsis and semantic relations (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ .
