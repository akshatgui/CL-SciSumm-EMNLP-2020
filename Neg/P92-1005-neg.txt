Figure 1 $$$$$ The salience relation S can be implemented as procedures that search for properties, objects or indices in context.
Figure 1 $$$$$ Furthermore, the different orders in which quantifier assumptions may be discharged in categorial derivation correspond to the choices that the quantifier rules permit for discharging quantified terms.

Figure 1 $$$$$ By contrast, aspects of semantic interpretation, such as reference and quantifier scope resolution, are often realised by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations.

This led to the development of underspecified semantic representations (e.g. QLF, Alshawi and Crouch (1992) and MRS, Copestake et al (2005)) which are easier to produce from text without contextual inference but which can be further specified as necessary for the task being performed. $$$$$ The sentence has two readings: a sloppy reading where John claims that he is clever, and a strict one where John claims that each of the boys is clever.

In contrast to statements of a fully specified logic in which denotations are typically taken to be functions from possible worlds to truth values (Montague, 1973), denotations of a statement in an under specified logic are typically taken to be relations between possible worlds and truth values (Alshawi and Crouch (1992), Alshawi (1996)). $$$$$ For John slept we might have: _s:sleep(term(+e,<type=event>, E-form(<type=trel,tense=past>, 11- and( event (E) ,R(E)) , _t) , _q1,_e), term(+j,<type=name>, J-name(J,'John'),_q2,_j)).

Secondly, monotonicity guarantees that interpretation algorithms can proceed incrementally, combining information from various sources in a nondestructive way (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ These changes have been implemented in a further development of the Core Language Engine (Alshawi 1992), although we will ignore most implementation issues in the present paper.

First, a quasi logical form allows the under-specification of several types of information, such as anaphoric references, ellipsis and semantic relations (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ Evaluation rules will be given for W(F,m,v), but since more than one rule may apply (or a rule may apply in more than one way), W will in general be a relation.
