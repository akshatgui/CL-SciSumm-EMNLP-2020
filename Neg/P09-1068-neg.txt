Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) describe a process to induce a partially ordered set of events related by a common protagonist by using an unsupervised distributional method to learn relations between events sharing co referring arguments, followed by temporal classification to induce partial order. $$$$$ The Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) model learns chains completely unsupervised, (albeit after parsing and resolving coreference in the text) by counting pairs of verbs that share coreferring arguments within documents and computing the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between these verb-argument pairs.

Inspired by Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) we acquire story plots automatically by recording events, their participants, and their precedence relationships as at tested in a training corpus. $$$$$ Unfortunately, creating these supervised corpora is an expensive and difficult multi-year effort, requiring complex decisions about the exact set of roles to be learned.

Our narrative schemas differ slightly from Chambers and Jurafsky (2009). $$$$$ Our argument learning algorithm not only performs unsupervised induction of situation-specific role classes, but the resulting roles and linking structures may also offer the possibility of (unsupervised) FrameNet-style semantic role labeling.
Our narrative schemas differ slightly from Chambers and Jurafsky (2009). $$$$$ Schemas are now learned by adding events that maximize equation 5: where |v |is the number of observed verbs and vj is the jth such verb.
