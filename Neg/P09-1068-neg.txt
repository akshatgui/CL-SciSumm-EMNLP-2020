Second, recent work by Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) has induced narrative chains, i.e., likely sequences of events, by their use of similar head words. $$$$$ Our model thus does not assume the set of roles is known in advance, and it learns the roles at the same time as clustering verbs into frame-like schemas.

Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) describe a process to induce a partially ordered set of events related by a common protagonist by using an unsupervised distributional method to learn relations between events sharing co referring arguments, followed by temporal classification to induce partial order. $$$$$ Argument Roles Finally, we evaluate the learned sets of entities that fill the argument slots.

Chambers and Jurafsky (2009, 2008) propose an unsupervised method for learning narrative schemas, chains of events whose arguments are filled with participant semantic roles defined over words. $$$$$ We use head words in the examples below, but we also evaluate with argument clustering by mapping head words to member clusters created with the CBC clustering algorithm (Pantel and Lin, 2002).

Inspired by Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) we acquire story plots automatically by recording events, their participants, and their precedence relationships as at tested in a training corpus. $$$$$ By jointly addressing both tasks, we improve on previous results in narrative/frame learning and induce rich frame-specific semantic roles.

Our narrative schemas differ slightly from Chambers and Jurafsky (2009). $$$$$ This paper describes a new approach to event semantics that jointly learns event relations and their participants from unlabeled corpora.

Our narrative schemas differ slightly from Chambers and Jurafsky (2009). $$$$$ Our significant improvement in the cloze evaluation shows that even though narrative cloze does not evaluate argument types, jointly modeling the arguments with events improves event clustering.

The unsupervised setting has also been considering for the related problem of learning narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009). $$$$$ An incorrect argument is test, as it was judged that a test is not a product.
The unsupervised setting has also been considering for the related problem of learning narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009). $$$$$ Our argument learning algorithm not only performs unsupervised induction of situation-specific role classes, but the resulting roles and linking structures may also offer the possibility of (unsupervised) FrameNet-style semantic role labeling.

Similar observations can be made with respect to Chambers and Jurafsky (2009) and Kasch and Oates (2010), who also study a single discourse relation (narration), and are thus more limited in scope than the approach described here. $$$$$ We now constrain the protagonist to be of a certain type or role.
