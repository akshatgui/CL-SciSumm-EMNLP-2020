One approach that can, in principle, better exploit both alignments from bitextsand make use of non-parallel corpora is the distributional collocational approach, e.g., as used by Fung and Yee (1998) and Rapp (1999). $$$$$ We also implement the Dice coefficient into similarity measure S2: where wic = TFie x IDFi Si is often used in comparing a short query with a document text, whereas S2 is used in comparing two document texts.
