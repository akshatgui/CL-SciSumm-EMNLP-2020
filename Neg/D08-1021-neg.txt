A well-known problem of phrase-based methods to paraphrase or term variation acquisition is the fact that a large proportion of the term variations or paraphrases proposed by the system are superor sub-strings of the original term (Callison-Burch, 2008). $$$$$ This is achieved by parsing the English side of a parallel corpus and altering the phrase extraction algorithm to extract phrase labels alongside bilingual phrase pairs.
