Human evaluators were then asked to score each pair of an original sentence and a paraphrased sentence with the following two 5-point scale grades proposed by Callison-Burch (2008): Grammaticality: whether the paraphrased sentence is grammatical (1: horrible, 5: perfect) Meaning: whether the meaning of the original sentence is properly retained by the paraphrased sentence (1: totally different, 5: equivalent). $$$$$ 30 items were excluded from our results subsequent to evaluation on the grounds that they consisted solely of punctuation and stop words like determiners, prepositions and pronouns.

Table 1 shows the average of the original 5-point scale scores and the percentage of examples that are judged correct based on a binary judgment (Callison-Burch, 2008): an example is considered to be correct iff the grammaticality score is 4 or above and/or the meaning score is 3 or above. $$$$$ We find that the quality of the paraphrases that are generated in this fashion improves significantly when they are required to be the same syntactic type as the phrase that they are paraphrasing.
