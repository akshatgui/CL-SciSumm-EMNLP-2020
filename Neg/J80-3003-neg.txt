 $$$$$ The speaker of 5.b or 5.c may in fact want the hearer to reach the salt, as does the speaker of 5.a, but he does not want his intention to be recognized by the hearer.
 $$$$$ The indirect interpretation can also be downgraded in the presence of stronger expectations.
 $$$$$ Thus only an indirect interpretation is possible.

In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ Throughout the paper we identify &quot;want&quot; and &quot;intend&quot;.
In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ The definitions of the speech acts REQUEST and INFORM used in this paper .are slightly different from the ones in Cohen and Perrault [1979] in that they rely on the existence of speech act bodies to account for indirect forms.

Indirect speech acts are studied by Clark (1979), Perrault and Allen (1980), Allen and Perrault (1980) and Asher and Lascarides (2003), who identify a wide range of factors that govern how speakers convey their intended messages and how hearers seek to uncover those messages from uncertain and conflicting signals. $$$$$ The operator definitions for speech acts used here are intended to facilitate the statement of the plan construction and inference rules.

This is computationally much less complex than classical speech act planning (Perrault and Allen, 1980), in which the intended physical effect comes at the end of a long chain of inferences. $$$$$ Brown proposes what she calls &quot;frozen ISA forms&quot; which directly relate surface form and indirect illocutionary force, bypassing the literal force.
