 $$$$$ But 2.3e is infelicitous as a (literal) question since there is no context where one can acquire information by querying one's own mental state.
 $$$$$ This cooperative behaviour is independently motivated and may or may not be intended by speakers.
 $$$$$ If the hearer believes it is intended, he or she can recognize the speech act as indirect; otherwise it is interpreted directly.

In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ If its preconditions are satisfied in the initial world, the plan is complete.
In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ He classified speech acts into three classes, the locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts.
In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ Certain syntactic and semantic devices, such as mood and explicit performative verbs, are used to indicate illocutionary force.
In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ These difficulties notwithstanding, we hope that we have helped show that the interaction of logic, philosophy of language, linguistics and artificial intelligence is productive and that the whole will shed light on each of the parts.

Indirect speech acts are studied by Clark (1979), Perrault and Allen (1980), Allen and Perrault (1980) and Asher and Lascarides (2003), who identify a wide range of factors that govern how speakers convey their intended messages and how hearers seek to uncover those messages from uncertain and conflicting signals. $$$$$ This step will only be reasonable if S can do the action, by a precondition-based heuristic.

This is computationally much less complex than classical speech act planning (Perrault and Allen, 1980), in which the intended physical effect comes at the end of a long chain of inferences. $$$$$ We propose an account of indirect forms of speech acts to request and inform based on the hypothesis that language users can recognize actions being performed by others, infer goals being sought, and cooperate in their achievement.
