Schone and Jurafsky (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001) applied Latent-Semantic Analysis (LSA) to the analysis of MWEs in the task of MWE discovery, by way of rescoring MWEs extracted from the corpus. $$$$$ Some researchers start with words and propose MWU induction methods that make use of parts of speech, lexicons, syntax or other linguistic structure (Justeson and Katz, 1995; Jacquemin, et al., 1997; Daille, 1996).
Schone and Jurafsky (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001) applied Latent-Semantic Analysis (LSA) to the analysis of MWEs in the task of MWE discovery, by way of rescoring MWEs extracted from the corpus. $$$$$ Our goal is to identify an automatic, knowledge-free algorithm that finds all and only those collocations where it is necessary to supply a definition.

Regarding (i), Schone and Jurafsky (2001) compare the semantic vector of a phrase p and the vectors of its component words in two ways $$$$$ Once we tokenize, we use Church’s (1995) suffix array approach to identify word n-grams that occur at least T times (for T=10).
Regarding (i), Schone and Jurafsky (2001) compare the semantic vector of a phrase p and the vectors of its component words in two ways $$$$$ One approximation redefines X and Y to be, respectively, the word sequences w1w2 ...wi and wi+1wi+2...wn, where i is chosen to maximize PXPY.

Statistical association measures are frequently used for MWU detection and collocation extraction (e.g. Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Evert and Krenn (2001), Pecina (2010)). $$$$$ We saw that MWU headword evaluations using WordNet provide similar results to those obtained from far more extensive webbased resources.

Examples include automatic thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994), word sense discrimination (Schutze, 1998) and disambiguation (McCarthy et al, 2004), collocation extraction (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001), text segmentation (Choi et al, 2001), and notably information retrieval (Salton et al, 1975). $$$$$ We proposed two new LSA-based approaches which attempted to address issues of non-compositionality and non-substitutivity.

By contrast, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) evaluate the identification of phrasal terms without grammatical filtering on a 6.7 million word extract from the TREC databases, applying both WordNet and on line dictionaries as gold standards. $$$$$ Prior to applying the algorithms, we lemmatize using a weakly-informed tokenizer that knows only that whitespace and punctuation separate words.

Since Schone and Jurafsky (2001) demonstrated similar results whether WordNet or on line dictionaries were used as a gold standard, WordNet was selected. $$$$$ One can conclude that WordNet may safely be used as a gold standard in future MWU headword evaluations.

There have also been a number of papers focusing on the detection of semantic non-compositional items in recent years beginning with the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2001). $$$$$ Yet the evaluations indicate that significant improvement is still needed in MWU-induction.

Furthermore, lists of topical unigrams are often made only marginally interpretable by virtue of their non-compositionality, the principle that a collocation's meaning typically is not derivable from its constituent words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001). $$$$$ An overbar signifies a variable’s complement.
