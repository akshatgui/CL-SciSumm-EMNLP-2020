In the research on recognizing contextual polarity done by Wilson et al (2009) a rich prior-polarity lexicon and dependency parsing technique were employed to detect and analyze subjectivity on phrasal level, taking into account all the power of context, captured through such features as negation, polarity modification and polarity shifters. $$$$$ However, we did change the polarity of a word if we strongly disagreed with its original class.8 For example, the word apocalypse is listed as positive in the General Inquirer; we changed its prior polarity to negative for our lexicon.

For the task of classifying the polarity of a given expression, there has been fairly extensive work on suitable classification features (Wilson et al, 2009). $$$$$ Given that by far the largest number of errors come from clues with positive, negative, or both prior polarity appearing in neutral contexts, we were motivated to try a two-step approach to the problem of sentiment classification.
