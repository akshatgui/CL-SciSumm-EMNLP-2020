This is significantly different from the previous input structure methods, which consider the linguistic structure as heuristic rules (Ding and Liu, 2007) or input features for classification (Wilson et al 2009). $$$$$ The MPQA annotation scheme has four types of annotations: objective speech event frames, two types of private state frames, and agent frames that are used for marking speakers of speech events and experiencers of private states.
