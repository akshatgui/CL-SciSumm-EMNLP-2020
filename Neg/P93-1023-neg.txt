Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ Furthermore, we plan to consider alternative evaluation methods and test our system on a much larger set of adjectives.
Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ We describe how our system exploits this linguistic knowledge to compute a measure of similarity between two adjectives, using statistical techniques and without having access to any semantic information about the adjectives.
Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ That was not done for the current evaluation because of the difficulty for humans of constructing large models.
Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ We discuss the properties of adjectival scales and of groups of semantically related adjectives and how they imply sources of linguistic knowledge in text corpora.

In this paper, we concentrate on adjectives, which have received less attention (see though Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Lapata (2001)). $$$$$ We also plan to extend the adjective-noun module to cover adjectives in predicative positions, in addition to our current use of attributive adjectives.
In this paper, we concentrate on adjectives, which have received less attention (see though Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Lapata (2001)). $$$$$ Furthermore, if the compiled information depends in any way on the domain of the application, the acquisition of lexical knowledge must be repeated whenever the system is transported to another domain.
In this paper, we concentrate on adjectives, which have received less attention (see though Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Lapata (2001)). $$$$$ Note that this evaluation method differs significantly from the alternative method of asking the humans to directly estimate the goodness of the system's results (e.g.

As evaluation measure, we used a pair-wise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic fscore as follows: Each verb pair in the cluster analysis was compared to the verb pairs in the gold standard classes, and evaluated as true or false positive (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993). $$$$$ In stage three we combine the values produced by the various similarity modules in stage two using a pre-specified algorithm.
As evaluation measure, we used a pair-wise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic fscore as follows: Each verb pair in the cluster analysis was compared to the verb pairs in the gold standard classes, and evaluated as true or false positive (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993). $$$$$ These patterns seem to suggest at least some degree of scalability.

We acknowledge previous work on the computational study of adjectival scales as in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), where a system could group gradation scales using a clustering algorithm. $$$$$ First, the results contain two clusters of gradable adjectives which fall in the same scale.
We acknowledge previous work on the computational study of adjectival scales as in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), where a system could group gradation scales using a clustering algorithm. $$$$$ To summarize, the system seems to be able to identify many of the existent semantic relationships among the adjectives, while its mistakes are limited to creating singleton groups containing adjectives that are related to other adjectives in the test set (e.g., missing the semantic associations between new-old and potential-real) and &quot;recognizing&quot; a non-significant relationship between real and new-unexpected in group 4.
We acknowledge previous work on the computational study of adjectival scales as in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), where a system could group gradation scales using a clustering algorithm. $$$$$ Finally, we thank Rebecca Passonneau and the anonymous reviewers for providing us with useful comments on earlier versions of the paper.
We acknowledge previous work on the computational study of adjectival scales as in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), where a system could group gradation scales using a clustering algorithm. $$$$$ We compute T for each pair of adjectives, adjusting for possible ties in the values of each variable, so that our statistic remains an unbiased estimator of T. We determine concordances and discordances by sorting the pairs of observations (noun frequencies) on one of the variables (adjectives), and computing how many of the (3) pairs of paired observations agree or disagree with the expected order on the other adjective.
