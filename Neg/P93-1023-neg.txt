Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ It demonstrates how high-level semantic knowledge can be computed from large amounts of low-level knowledge (essentially plain text, part-of-speech rules, and optionally syntactic relations).
Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ We conclude by presenting evaluation methods for the task at hand, and analyzing the significance of the results obtained.
Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ We describe how our system exploits this linguistic knowledge to compute a measure of similarity between two adjectives, using statistical techniques and without having access to any semantic information about the adjectives.

In this paper, we concentrate on adjectives, which have received less attention (see though Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Lapata (2001)). $$$$$ First, the results contain two clusters of gradable adjectives which fall in the same scale.

As evaluation measure, we used a pair-wise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic fscore as follows $$$$$ Finally, note that even in group 4 which is the weakest group produced, there is a positive semantic correlation between the adjectives new and unexpected.
As evaluation measure, we used a pair-wise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic fscore as follows $$$$$ As an example of this phenomenon, consider the hypothetical (single) model and partition of Figure 4; while the partition differs from the model only in that the first cluster has been split into two, the recall score abruptly falls to 50%.

We acknowledge previous work on the computational study of adjectival scales as in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), where a system could group gradation scales using a clustering algorithm. $$$$$ We have described a system for extracting groups of semantically related adjectives from large text corpora, with a flexible architecture which allows for multiple knowledge sources influencing similarity to be easily incorporated into the system.
