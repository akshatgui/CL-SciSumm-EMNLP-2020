In sentiment analysis research, Read (2005) used emoticons in newsgroup articles to extract instances relevant for training polarity classifiers. $$$$$ However, that study focused on a three-way classification (positive, negative and neutral).

We therefore experiment with multiple such conventions with apparently similar meanings - here, emoticons (following (Read, 2005)) and Twitter hash tags - allowing us to examine the similarity of classifiers trained on independent labels but intended to detect the same underlying class. $$$$$ A sub-topic of this research is that of Sentiment Classification.

The regulating aspects of semantic orientation of a text are natural language context information (Pang et al, 2002) language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the time dimension (Read, 2005). $$$$$ When the author of an electronic communication uses an emoticon, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state.

According to (Read, 2005), when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state. $$$$$ We propose a novel source of training data based on the language used in conjunction with emoticons in Usenet newsgroups.
According to (Read, 2005), when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state. $$$$$ Each subset contains further subsets of articles of positive and negative sentiment (selected by independent trained annotators), each containing 100 stories.

According to (Read, 2005), when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state. $$$$$ To investigate the effect of time on sentiment classification, we constructed a new set of movie reviews, following the same approach used by Pang et al. (2002) when they created the Polarity 1.0 dataset.

The regulating aspects which govern the lexical level semantic orientation are natural language context (Pang et al, 2002), language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimension (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hidden aspects. $$$$$ This research was funded by a UK EPSRC studentship.

The approach is similar to the one in (Read, 2005). $$$$$ The models were trained using unigram features, accounting for the presence of feature types in a document, rather than the frequency, as Pang et al. (2002) found that this is the most effective strategy for sentiment classification.
