In sentiment analysis research, Read (2005) used emoticons in newsgroup articles to extract instances relevant for training polarity classifiers. $$$$$ Traditional machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem with reasonable success, but they have been shown to work well only when there is a good match between the training and test data with respect to topic.
In sentiment analysis research, Read (2005) used emoticons in newsgroup articles to extract instances relevant for training polarity classifiers. $$$$$ This paper demonstrates that match with respect to domain and time is also important, and presents preliminary experiments with training data labeled with emoticons, which has the potential of being independent of domain, topic and time.
In sentiment analysis research, Read (2005) used emoticons in newsgroup articles to extract instances relevant for training polarity classifiers. $$$$$ As investigating skew between positive and negative distributions is outside the scope of this work, we also extracted 13,000 article extracts containing smile emoticons.

We therefore experiment with multiple such conventions with apparently similar meanings - here, emoticons (following (Read, 2005)) and Twitter hash tags - allowing us to examine the similarity of classifiers trained on independent labels but intended to detect the same underlying class. $$$$$ This paper has demonstrated that dependency in sentiment classification can take the form of domain, topic, temporal and language style.

The regulating aspects of semantic orientation of a text are natural language context information (Pang et al, 2002) language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the time dimension (Read, 2005). $$$$$ These tables report the average accuracies over three folds, with the standard deviation as a measure of error.

We have built a corpus of tweets written in English following the procedure described in (Read, 2005) and (Go et al, 2009). $$$$$ Sentiment Classification seeks to identify a piece of text according to its author’s general feeling toward their subject, be it positive or negative.

According to (Read, 2005), when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state. $$$$$ Engstr¨om (2004) demonstrated how machinelearning techniques for sentiment classification can be topic dependent.
According to (Read, 2005), when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state. $$$$$ This revealed an optimum context of a window of 50 tokens taken from a training set of 21,000 articles for the Naive Bayes classifier.
According to (Read, 2005), when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state. $$$$$ We collected a corpus of text marked-up with emoticons by downloading Usenet newsgroups and saving an article if it contained an emoticon listed in Figure 4.

The regulating aspects which govern the lexical level semantic orientation are natural language context (Pang et al, 2002), language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimension (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hidden aspects. $$$$$ Some examples of noise taken from the Emoticons dataset are: mixed sentiment, e.g.

We seed the graph using the polarity values in the OpinionFinder lexicon (Wilson et al, 2005), the known polarity of emoticons, and a maximum entropy classifier trained on 1.8 million tweets with automatically assigned labels based on the presence of positive and negative emoticons, like Read (2005) and Go et al (2009). $$$$$ Previous work has shown that traditional text classification approaches can be quite effective when applied to the sentiment analysis problem.
