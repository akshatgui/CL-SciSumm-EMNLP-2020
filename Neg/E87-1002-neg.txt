 $$$$$ The approach I intend to take is inspired, not only by finite-state morphology, broadly construed, but equally by autosegmental phonology as proposed by Goldsmith (1979) and the autosegmental morphology of McCarthy (1979) All the data that I have used in this work is taken from McCarthy (1979) and my debt to him will be clear throughout. forms that can be constructed on the basis of each of the stems shown.
 $$$$$ What is required in this case is a transducer that allows the root tape to remain stationary while the template tape moves over a &quot;G&quot;, provided no spreading will be allowed to occur later to fill consonantal slots that would Fig.
 $$$$$ Most important among the difficulties that this entails are those having to do with the different shapes that formatives assume in different environments.

One early approach, suggested by Kay (1987) and later pursued in different variants by Kiraz (1994, 2000) among others, was to, instead of modeling morphology along the more traditional finite-state transducer, modeling it with a n-tape automaton, where tapes would carry precisely this interleaving that is called for in Semitic interdigitation. $$$$$ In particular, these extensions will leave us clearly within the domain of finite-state devices.

Kay (1987) devised a framework with which each of the auto segmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form. $$$$$ Since the root vowel affects the latter part of the root, it seems reasonable that it should be positioned to the right.

A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ It is only right that I should point out the difficulty of accounting satisfactorily for the vocalic contribution of verbal roots.
A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ However it is an advantage of parallel machines that they can be used with very little loss of efficiency without combining them in this way.
A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ The bottom tape—the one containing the surface form—is therefore being written and it is for this reason that nothing appears to the right.

Kay (1987) proposes a framework with which each of the auto segmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form. $$$$$ The data in Table I is, of course, insufficient to answer question. but a plausible answer that strongly suggests itself is that the &quot;X&quot; slot prefers a consonantal filler except where that would result in gemination.
