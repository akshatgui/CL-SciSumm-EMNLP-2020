 $$$$$ The other alternative is that the transducer should enter the &quot;geminate&quot; state over a transition over a in the template with the root tape remaining stationary.
 $$$$$ If the mechanism were as just described, and the triliteral forms were &quot;CVGCVC&quot; and &quot;tVCVGCVC&quot; respectively, then the quadriliteral forms would have to be generated on a different base.

One early approach, suggested by Kay (1987) and later pursued in different variants by Kiraz (1994, 2000) among others, was to, instead of modeling morphology along the more traditional finite-state transducer, modeling it with a n-tape automaton, where tapes would carry precisely this interleaving that is called for in Semitic interdigitation. $$$$$ There must be a &quot;V&quot; on the template tape and an &quot;a&quot; in the current position of the vocalism.

When this appears, the corresponding tape is not examined, and it does not advance as the machine moves to the next state.

Kay (1987) devised a framework with which each of the auto segmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form. $$$$$ 1 shows a schema for the transition diagram of a transducer that has this effect.

A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ Consider, in particular, the following sets of forms: ktanbab dhanraj kattab dahraj takattab tadahraj Those in the second column are based on the root /dhrj/.

A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ The term two-level morphology, however, is used in a more restricted way, to apply to a system in which no intermediate forms are posited, even in the original grammatical formalism.
A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ Not surprisingly, a considerable amount of information about the language is contained just in the constitution of the alphabet.

Kay (1987) proposes a framework with which each of the auto segmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form. $$$$$ This is intended to capture the notion of spreading, from autosegmental morphology, that is, the principal according to which the last item in a string may be reused when required to fill several positions.
