The shared task of CoNLL-2002 dealt with named entity recognition for Spanish and Dutch (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). $$$$$ The Dutch data consist of four editions of the Belgian newspaper &quot;De Morgen&quot; of 2000 (June 2, July 1, August 1 and September 1).

We do not undertake the problem of named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), but rather apply an existing NER system as a preprocessing step (Finkel et al, 2005). $$$$$ We have described the CoNLL-2002 shared task: language-independent named entity recognition.

We do not undertake the problem of named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), but rather apply an existing NER system as a preprocessing step (Finkel et al, 2005). $$$$$ The system performed better with the derived word lists than with the external named entity lists (Spanish test set: F,3=1=75.78; Dutch test set: F,3=1=72.57).

Empirical evidence for this argument can be seen from the result of the CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002) (Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder, 2003), where the ranking of the participating systems changes with the test corpora. $$$$$ The shared task of CoNLL-2002 concerns language-independent named entity recognition.

Similarly to classical NLP tasks such as base noun phrase chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) or named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate the mention detection problem as a classification problem, by assigning to each token in the text a label, indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions. $$$$$ A boosted decision tree method obtained the best performance on both data sets (Carreras et al., 2002).

It is especially challenging to extract the named entities from the text sources written in languages other than English which, in practice, is supported by the results of the shared tasks on the named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). $$$$$ We will concentrate on four types of named entities: persons, locations, organizations and names of miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups.

In addition, several competitions have been organized, with a focus on multilingual NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). $$$$$ The participants of the shared task have been offered training and test data for two European languages: Spanish and Dutch.

Similarly to classical NLP tasks, such as Base Phrase Chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999) (BPC) or NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate the MD task as a sequence classification problem, i.e. the classifier assigns to each token in the text a label indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions. $$$$$ We have described the CoNLL-2002 shared task: language-independent named entity recognition.
