Interestingly, recent approaches to the semantic composition of adjectives with nouns such as Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) and Guevara (2010) draw on the classical analysis of adjectives within the Montagovian tradition of formal semantic theory (Montague, 1974), on which they are treated as higher order predicates, and model adjectives as matrices of weights that are applied to noun vectors. $$$$$ We assume that the composition of meaning in DSMs is a function mapping two or more independent vectors in a multidimensional space to a newly composed vector the same space and, further, we assume that semantic composition is dependent on the syntactic structure being instantiated in natural language.1 Assuming that each dimension in the starting vectors v1 and v2 is a candidate predictor, and that each dimension in the composed vector v3 is a dependent variable, vector-based semantic compositionality can be formulated as a problem of multivariate multiple regression.
