 $$$$$ These relations, called RST (rhetorical structure theory), are used recursively; the assumption (never explicitly stated) is that a paragraph is only coherent if all its parts can eventually be made to fit into one overarching relation.
 $$$$$ However, neither extreme is satisfactory; as is clear from paragraph (b), &quot;short&quot; spans of text can be linked and &quot;long&quot; ones left separate.
 $$$$$ For general comments, all the above, and Cede Paris, Stuart Shapiro, and Norm Sondheimer.
 $$$$$ However, for ease of use, they have been implemented as binary relations in the structurer. as well as from a few other operators such as AND and OR.

 $$$$$ This goal is produced by PEA, together with the appropriate representation elements (ASK-I.
 $$$$$ The nucleus and satellite constraints become requirements that must be met by any piece of text before it can be used in the relation (i.e., before it can be coherently juxtaposed with the preceding text).
 $$$$$ The effect field contains a description of the intended effect of the relation (i.e., the goal that the plan achieves, if properly executed).
 $$$$$ In other words, in order to bring about the state which both speaker and hearer know that the purpose of know that they both know it, etc.

Some text planners take as their goal the delivery of a single fact, or a set of facts, but take into account that other information may need to be given first for each message to be understood, other information may need to be given after to counter misconceptions, and examples may be given to aide assimilation (for in stance, the RST text planners, such as Hovy 1988). $$$$$ Unmatched constraints become subgoals which are posted on an agenda for the next level of planning.

This approach is adopted from text generation where plan-operators are responsible for choosing linguistic means in order to create coherent stretches of text (see, for instance, (Moore and Paris, 1989) and (Hovy, 1988)). $$$$$ These relations, called RST (rhetorical structure theory), are used recursively; the assumption (never explicitly stated) is that a paragraph is only coherent if all its parts can eventually be made to fit into one overarching relation.

As for any generated text, a good summary also requires a text plan (Hovy, 1988) (McKeown, 1985). $$$$$ In this text, each clause (en route, rendezvous, arrive, visit) is a separate input element; the structurer linked them using the relations Sequence and Purpose (the same Purpose as shown above; it is signalled by &quot;in order to&quot;).
