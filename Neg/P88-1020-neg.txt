 $$$$$ The problem is clear: how should sentences in the paragraph be scoped?
 $$$$$ A simplistic, brute-force way to achieve coherent text would be to search this space and pick out the coherent paragraphs.

 $$$$$ As defined by Mann and Thompson, RST relations hold between two successive pieces of text (at the lowest level, between two clauses; at the highest level, between two parts that make up a paragraph)' .
 $$$$$ They include: The problem of text coherence can be characterized in specific terms as follows.
 $$$$$ This goal is produced by PEA, together with the appropriate representation elements (ASK-I.

Some text planners take as their goal the delivery of a single fact, or a set of facts, but take into account that other information may need to be given first for each message to be understood, other information may need to be given after to counter misconceptions, and examples may be given to aide assimilation (for in stance, the RST text planners, such as Hovy 1988). $$$$$ For help with Penman, Robert Albano, John Bateman, Bob Kasper, Christian Matthiessen, Lynn Poulton, and Richard Whitney.

This approach is adopted from text generation where plan-operators are responsible for choosing linguistic means in order to create coherent stretches of text (see, for instance, (Moore and Paris, 1989) and (Hovy, 1988)). $$$$$ In essence, these schemas are paragraph templates; coherence is enforced by the correct nesting and filling-in of templates.
This approach is adopted from text generation where plan-operators are responsible for choosing linguistic means in order to create coherent stretches of text (see, for instance, (Moore and Paris, 1989) and (Hovy, 1988)). $$$$$ Unmatched constraints become subgoals which are posted on an agenda for the next level of planning.

As for any generated text, a good summary also requires a text plan (Hovy, 1988) (McKeown, 1985). $$$$$ The structurer produces all coherent paragraphs (that is, coherent as defined by the relations) that satisfy the given goal(s) for any set of input elements.
As for any generated text, a good summary also requires a text plan (Hovy, 1988) (McKeown, 1985). $$$$$ This formalization process is difficult, because it goes handin-hand with the development of terms with which to characterize the relations' goals/constraints.
