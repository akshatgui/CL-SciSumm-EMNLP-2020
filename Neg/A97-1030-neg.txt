The only exception is in (Wacholder et al 1997) where the reported performance for the sole semantic disambiguation task of PNs is 79%. $$$$$ After information about names and their referents has been extracted from individual documents, an aggregation process combines the names collected from all the documents into a dictionary, or database of names, representative of the document collection.
The only exception is in (Wacholder et al 1997) where the reported performance for the sole semantic disambiguation task of PNs is 79%. $$$$$ In terms of semantic disambiguation, Nominator failed to assign an entity type to 21% of the names it identified.
The only exception is in (Wacholder et al 1997) where the reported performance for the sole semantic disambiguation task of PNs is 79%. $$$$$ Each of these can be exploited along a continuum, from 'cheaper' to computationally and manually more expensive usage.

Since the introduction of this task in MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), numerous systems using various ways of exploiting entity-specific and local context features were proposed, from relatively simple character based models such as Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) and Klein et al (2003) to complex models making use of various lexical, syntactic ,morpho logical, and orthographical information, such as Wacholder et al (1997), Fleischman and Hovy (2002), and Florian et al (2003). $$$$$ Otherwise, it is removed from the list.

Ravin and Kazi (1999) further refined the method of solving co-reference through measuring context similarity and integrated it into Nominator (Wacholder et al, 1997), which was one of the first successful systems for named entity recognition and co-reference resolution. $$$$$ But even if an existing database is reliable, names that are not yet in it must be discovered and information in the database must be over-ridden when appropriate.

The entity identification and in-document co reference components resemble the Nominator system (Wacholder et al, 1997). $$$$$ In fact, this is what many commercially available name identification applications use (e.g., Hayes 1994).

The entity identification and in-document co reference components resemble the Nominator system (Wacholder et al, 1997). $$$$$ Thus, the string The Natural History Museum and The Board of Education is split at and because each of its substrings contains a strong-scope NP-head (as we define it) with modifiers within its scope.

As Wacholder et al (1997) noted, it is fairly common for one of the mentions of an entity in a document to be a long, typical surface form of that entity (e.g., George W. Bush), while the other mentions are shorter surface forms (e.g., Bush). $$$$$ Because of the strong scope of Museum, as mentioned above, no splitting occurs.

 $$$$$ Name identification requires resolution of a subset of the types of structural and semantic ambiguities encountered in the analysis of nouns and noun phrases (NPs) in natural language processing.
 $$$$$ Some heuristics weigh the relative scope strength in the substrings on either side of the operator.

We constructed a large, automatically annotated corpus by merging the output of Charniak's statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) with that of the IBM named entity recognition system Nominator (Wacholder et al,1997). $$$$$ Because of these difficulties, we believe that for the forseeable future, practical applications to discover new names in text will continue to require the sort of human effort invested in Nominator.
We constructed a large, automatically annotated corpus by merging the output of Charniak's statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) with that of the IBM named entity recognition system Nominator (Wacholder et al,1997). $$$$$ In general, two types of resources are available for disambiguation: context and world knowledge.

Wacholder et al (1997) use hand-written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories. $$$$$ In fact, this is what many commercially available name identification applications use (e.g., Hayes 1994).
Wacholder et al (1997) use hand-written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories. $$$$$ It may be one of the variants found in the document or it may be constructed from components of different ones As the links are formed, each group is assigned a type.
Wacholder et al (1997) use hand-written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories. $$$$$ For example, Mr. Jordan of Steptoe & Johnson is split into Mr. Jordan and Steptoe & Johnson.
Wacholder et al (1997) use hand-written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories. $$$$$ If they are sentenceinitial, Nominator accepts as names both New Sears and New Coke; it also accepts sentence-initial Five Reagan as a variant of President Reagan, if the two co-occur in a document.

Approaches to this problem include Wacholder et al (1997), focusing on the variation of surface name for a given referent, and Smith and Crane (2002), resolving geographic name ambiguity. $$$$$ Section 3 discusses the role of context and world knowledge in their disambiguation; Section 4 describes the process of name discovery as implemented in Nominator, a module for proper name recognition developed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.

A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997, Wacholder et al, 1997, Bikel et al, 1997). $$$$$ The resolution of structural ambiguity such as PP attachment and conjunction scope is required in order to automatically establish the exact boundaries of proper names.

A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997, Wacholder et al, 1997, Bikel et al, 1997). $$$$$ In addition, as the heuristics depend on linguistic conventions, they are language dependent, and need updating when stylistic conventions change.
A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997, Wacholder et al, 1997, Bikel et al, 1997). $$$$$ In its minimal use of resources, Nominator follows this trend: it relies on no syntactic information and on a small semantic lexicon — an authority list which could easily be modified to include information about new domains.
