Since the introduction of this task in MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), numerous systems using various ways of exploiting entity-specific and local context features were proposed, from relatively simple character based models such as Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) and Klein et al (2003) to complex models making use of various lexical, syntactic ,morpho logical, and orthographical information, such as Wacholder et al (1997), Fleischman and Hovy (2002), and Florian et al (2003). $$$$$ ...

Ravin and Kazi (1999) further refined the method of solving co-reference through measuring context similarity and integrated it into Nominator (Wacholder et al, 1997), which was one of the first successful systems for named entity recognition and co-reference resolution. $$$$$ This is the case with Justice Department or Frank Sinatra Building.
Ravin and Kazi (1999) further refined the method of solving co-reference through measuring context similarity and integrated it into Nominator (Wacholder et al, 1997), which was one of the first successful systems for named entity recognition and co-reference resolution. $$$$$ We identify three indicators of potential structural ambiguity, prepositions, conjunctions and possessive pronouns, which we refer to as 'ambiguous operators'.

The entity identification and in-document co reference components resemble the Nominator system (Wacholder et al, 1997). $$$$$ Otherwise, it is removed from the list.
The entity identification and in-document co reference components resemble the Nominator system (Wacholder et al, 1997). $$$$$ If they are sentenceinitial, Nominator accepts as names both New Sears and New Coke; it also accepts sentence-initial Five Reagan as a variant of President Reagan, if the two co-occur in a document.

As Wacholder et al (1997) noted, it is fairly common for one of the mentions of an entity in a document to be a long, typical surface form of that entity (e.g., George W. Bush), while the other mentions are shorter surface forms (e.g., Bush). $$$$$ While the heuristics for splitting names are linguistically motivated and rule-governed, the heuristics for handling sentence-initial names are based on patterns of word occurrence in the document.

 $$$$$ Nominator does not use this type of external context.
 $$$$$ Ambiguity remains one of the main challenges in the processing of natural language text.
 $$$$$ Beyond the ambiguities that proper names share with common nouns, some ambiguities are particular to names: noun phrases may be ambiguous between a name reading and a common noun phrase, as in Candy, the person's name, versus candy the food, or The House as an organization versus a house referring to a building.

We constructed a large, automatically annotated corpus by merging the output of Charniak's statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) with that of the IBM named entity recognition system Nominator (Wacholder et al,1997). $$$$$ Text processing applications, such as machine translation systems, information retrieval systems or natural-language understanding systems, need to identify multi-word expressions that refer to proper names of people, organizations, places, laws and other entities.
We constructed a large, automatically annotated corpus by merging the output of Charniak's statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) with that of the IBM named entity recognition system Nominator (Wacholder et al,1997). $$$$$ In addition, as the heuristics depend on linguistic conventions, they are language dependent, and need updating when stylistic conventions change.

Wacholder et al (1997) use hand-written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories. $$$$$ Most proper name recognizers that have been reported on in print either take as input text tagged by part-of-speech (e.g., the systems of (Paik et al. 1993) and (Mani et al.
Wacholder et al (1997) use hand-written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories. $$$$$ Since it is usually the case that a right-hand operator has stronger scope over a left-hand one, we evaluate strings containing operators from right to left.

Wacholder et al (1997) use hand-written rules and knowledge bases to classify proper names into broad categories. $$$$$ Similarly, an information retrieval system should not attempt to expand Candy to all of its morphological variants or suggest synonyms (Wacholder et al. 1994).

Approaches to this problem include Wacholder et al (1997), focusing on the variation of surface name for a given referent, and Smith and Crane (2002), resolving geographic name ambiguity. $$$$$ The presence or absence of a personal title is also important for determining confidence: If present, the result is a high confidence score (e.g., Mrs. Ruth Lake); No personal title with a known first name results in a low positive confidence score (e.g., Ruth Lake, Beverly Hills); and no personal title with an unknown first name results in a zero score (e.g., Panorama Lake).
Approaches to this problem include Wacholder et al (1997), focusing on the variation of surface name for a given referent, and Smith and Crane (2002), resolving geographic name ambiguity. $$$$$ A more difficult situation arises when a sentenceinitial candidate name contains a valid name that begins at the second word of the string.
Approaches to this problem include Wacholder et al (1997), focusing on the variation of surface name for a given referent, and Smith and Crane (2002), resolving geographic name ambiguity. $$$$$ The main reason that names remain untyped is insufficent evidence in the document.

A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997, Wacholder et al, 1997, Bikel et al, 1997). $$$$$ In addition, naming conventions are sometimes disregarded by people who enjoy creating novel and unconventional names.

A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997, Wacholder et al, 1997, Bikel et al, 1997). $$$$$ After information about names and their referents has been extracted from individual documents, an aggregation process combines the names collected from all the documents into a dictionary, or database of names, representative of the document collection.
