The error model LTR was trained exactly as described originally by Brill and Moore (2000). $$$$$ This is because the results on the Brown Corpus are computed per token, whereas above we were computing results per type.
The error model LTR was trained exactly as described originally by Brill and Moore (2000). $$$$$ If we took a text corpus, then extracted all the spelling errors found in the corpus and then used those errors for training, count( ) would simply be the number of times substring occurs in the text corpus.

In baseline speller we use a substring-based error model P dist (q0 $$$$$ We will define the spelling correction problem abstractly as follows: Given an alphabet Σ , a dictionary D consisting of strings in Σ * and a string s, where s ∉ D and s ∈ Σ *, find the word w∈ D that is most likely to have been erroneously input as s. The requirement that s ∉ D can be dropped, but it only makes sense to do so in the context of a sufficiently powerful language model.

The next class of approaches applied the noisy channel model to correct single word spelling errors (Kernighan et al., 1990), (Brill and Moore, 2000). $$$$$ They use as a training corpus a set of spacedelimited strings that were found in a large collection of text, and that (a) do not appear in their dictionary and (b) are no more than one edit away from a word that does appear in the dictionary.

For example, Brill and Moore (2000) combine a character-based alignment with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to develop an improved probabilistic error model for spelling correction. $$$$$ As we expected, positional information helps more when using a richer edit set than when using only single character edits.

The largest step towards an automatically trainable spelling system was the statistical model for spelling errors (Brill and Moore, 2000). $$$$$ If we think of the x-axis of the standard weight matrix for computing edit distance as corresponding to w (a word in the dictionary), then the vector at each node in the trie corresponds to a column in the weight matrix associated with computing the distance between s and the string prefix ending at that trie node.

In addition to the simple Levenshtein distance, we also use generalized string-to-string edit distance (Brill and Moore, 2000), which we trained on aligned katakana-English word pairs in the same manner as Brill et al (2001). $$$$$ The data we are using is much cleaner than that used in (Church and Gale 1991) which probably explains why reestimation benefited them in their experiments and did not give any benefit to the error models in our experiments.

One interesting future avenue to consider is to use the edit distance functions in our current model to select a subset of query-candidate pairs that are similar in terms of these functions, separately for the surface and Romanized forms, and use this subset to align the character strings in these query-candidate pairs as described in Brill and Moore (2000), and add the edit operations derived in this manner to the term variation identification classifier as features. $$$$$ After choosing this particular word and partition, the probability of generating the string fisikle with the partition f i s i k le would be P(f  |ph) *P(i  |y) * P(s  |s) *P(i  |i) * P(k  |c) *P(le  |al).3 The above example points to advantages of our model compared to previous models based on weighted Damerau-Levenshtein distance.

Brill and Moore (2000) introduced a model that worked on character sequences, not only on character level, and was conditioned on where in the word the sequences occurred. $$$$$ For the error model, they first define the confusion set of a string s to include s, along with all words w in the dictionary D such that s can be derived from w by a single application of one of the four edit operations: Let C be the number of words in the confusion set of d. Then they define the error model, for all s in the confusion set of d, as: This is a very simple error model, where is the prior on a typed word being correct, and the remaining probability mass is distributed evenly among all other words in the confusion set.
