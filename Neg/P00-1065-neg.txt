While a machine learning approach is used in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000) to determine general semantic roles, we used a simple rule-based traversal of the parse tree instead, which could also reliably determine the generic agent and patient role of a sentence, and this suffices for our current purpose. $$$$$ They show promise for a more sophisticated approach to generalize beyond the relatively small number of frames considered in the tasks.

Many researchers (Blaheta and Charniak 2000), (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000), showed that lexical and syntactic information is very useful for predicate argument recognition tasks, such as semantic roles. $$$$$ Current information extraction systems often use domain-specific frame-and-slot templates to extract facts about, for example, financial news or interesting political events.

(Pado et al., 2008) describe an unsupervised approach that, like ours, uses verbal argument patterns to deduce deverbal patterns, though the resulting labels are semantic roles used in SLR tasks (cf.
