As the result, we conclude that if we do not resolve PP attachment problem (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), to the expected extent, we will not extract he maximal noun phrases. $$$$$ There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains.

PP-attachment is known to depend on the object of the preposition (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning.

We therefore analyze the errors made on the development set to determine whether the difficult remaining cases for parsers correspond to the Hindle and Rooth (1993) style PP attachment classification task. $$$$$ Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner (1990) found lexical preferences to be the key to resolving attachment ambiguity.

One of the earliest corpus-based approaches to prepositional phrase attachment used lexical preference by computing co-occurrence frequencies (lexical associations) of verbs and nouns with prepositions (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ Of these, 467,920 were recognized as the object of a verb, and 753,843 were followed by a preposition.

 $$$$$ We began this paper by alluding to several approaches to PP attachment, specifically work assuming the construction of discourse models, approaches based on structural attachment preferences, and work indicating a dominant role for lexical preference.

There are multiple approaches ranging from purely statistical (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), to hybrid approaches that take into account the lexical semantics of the verb (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ Our results tend to confirm the importance of lexical preference.

Li and Abe (1998) use a minimum description length-based algorithm to find an optimal tree cut over WordNet for each classification problem, finding improvements over both lexical association (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) and conceptual association, and equaling the transformation-based results. $$$$$ In the situation described by Example 12a, the bar and the described event or events are presumably in the same location, and so there is no semantic reason to decide on one attachment.

Training on unambiguous cases is similar in spirit to (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ For each noun phrase head, we recorded the following preposition if any occurred (ignoring whether or not the parser had attached the preposition to the noun phrase), and the preceding verb if the noun phrase was the object of that verb.

Pattern (5) is motivated by the observation that if n1 is a pronoun, this suggests a verb attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ We use the notation NULL to emphasize that in order for a preposition licensed by the verb to be in the immediately postnominal position, the noun must have no following complements (or adjuncts).
