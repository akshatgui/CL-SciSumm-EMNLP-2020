PP-attachment is known to depend on the object of the preposition (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ We propose that many ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with verbal and nominal heads, estimated on the basis of distribution in an automatically parsed corpus.

PP-attachment is known to depend on the object of the preposition (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ And our estimation procedure has the property that it defaults (in case of novel words) to the average behavior for nouns or verbs, for instance, reflecting a default preference with of for noun attachment.

For prepositions, we consider only cases in which the parent is a noun or a verb and the child is a noun (this corresponds to the cases considered by Hindleand Rooth (1993) and others). $$$$$ This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning.

We therefore analyze the errors made on the development set to determine whether the difficult remaining cases for parsers correspond to the Hindle and Rooth (1993) style PP attachment classification task. $$$$$ Indeed, one recent proposal suggests that resolving attachment ambiguity requires the construction of a discourse model in which the entities referred to in a text are represented and reasoned about (Altmann and Steedman 1988).

Hindle and Rooth (1993) were the first to show that a corpus-based approach to PP attachment ambiguity resolution can lead to good results. $$$$$ If the noun phrase is an object, the root of the governing verb appears in the Verb column: aim is the root of aimed, the verb governing the empty category [„,, +[.

One of the earliest corpus-based approaches to prepositional phrase attachment used lexical preference by computing co-occurrence frequencies (lexical associations) of verbs and nouns with prepositions (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ We propose that many ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with verbal and nominal heads, estimated on the basis of distribution in an automatically parsed corpus.

There are multiple approaches ranging from purely statistical (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), to hybrid approaches that take into account the lexical semantics of the verb (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ Noun phrases with no head, or where the head is not a common noun, are coded in a special way: DART-PNP represents a noun phrase beginning with a definite article and headed by a proper noun, and VING represents a gerundive noun phrase.

Li and Abe (1998) use a minimum description length-based algorithm to find an optimal tree cut over WordNet for each classification problem, finding improvements over both lexical association (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) and conceptual association, and equaling the transformation-based results. $$$$$ This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning.

It is also the case that we thought PP attachment might be improved because of the increased coverage of preposition noun and preposition-verb combinations that work such as (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) show to be so important. $$$$$ From another perspective, our results are less good than what might be demanded.

Hindle and Rooth (1993) used a partial parser to extract (v, n, p) tuples from a corpus, where p is the preposition whose attachment is ambiguous between the verb v and the noun n. $$$$$ The existence of such ambiguity raises problems for language models.
