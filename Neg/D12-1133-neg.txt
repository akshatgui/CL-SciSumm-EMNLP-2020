 $$$$$ Evaluation on four languages shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy over a pipeline system with state-of-the-art results across the board.
 $$$$$ We also see improved accuracies for common and proper nouns, which are both capitalized in standard German orthography and therefore often mistagged, and for relative pronouns, which are less often confused for determiners in the joint model.

Li et al (2012) and Bohnet and Nivre (2012) use joint models for POS tagging and dependency parsing, significantly outperforming their pipeline counterparts. $$$$$ Evaluation on four languages shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy over a pipeline system with state-of-the-art results across the board.
Li et al (2012) and Bohnet and Nivre (2012) use joint models for POS tagging and dependency parsing, significantly outperforming their pipeline counterparts. $$$$$ Experiments show that joint modeling improves both tagging and parsing accuracy, leading to state-of-the-art accuracy for richly inflected languages like Czech and German as well as more configurational languages like Chinese and English.

In parsing, Bohnet and Nivre (2012) and Bohnet et al (2013) propose a model for joint morphological analysis, part-of speech tagging and dependency parsing using a Usingeval.pl from Buchholz and Marsi (2006). $$$$$ Most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins.

 $$$$$ Transition-based dependency parsing was pioneered by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and Nivre et al. (2004), who used classifiers trained to predict individual actions of a deterministic shift-reduce parser.
 $$$$$ We present a transitionbased system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with nonprojective trees.
 $$$$$ Graph features are defined over the factors of a graph-based dependency parser, which was shown to improve the accuracy of a transition-based parser by Zhang and Clark (2008).

Bohnet and Nivre (2012)'s transition-based system jointly performs POS tagging and dependency parsing, which shows higher accuracy than ours. $$$$$ The improvement in TLAS is statistically significant with p < 0.01 for all languages (paired t-test).
Bohnet and Nivre (2012)'s transition-based system jointly performs POS tagging and dependency parsing, which shows higher accuracy than ours. $$$$$ Dependency-based syntactic parsing has been the focus of intense research efforts during the last decade, and the state of the art today is represented by globally normalized discriminative models that are induced using structured learning.
Bohnet and Nivre (2012)'s transition-based system jointly performs POS tagging and dependency parsing, which shows higher accuracy than ours. $$$$$ Similarly, the score of the new hypothesis is the sum of the score f(t, h.c) Â· w of the current configuration-transition pair and the score of the old hypothesis (line 10).

Bohnet and Nivre (2012) introduced a transition-based system that jointly performed POS tagging and dependency parsing. $$$$$ In future work we intend to explore joint models that incorporate not only basic part-of-speech tags but also more fine-grained morphological features.
