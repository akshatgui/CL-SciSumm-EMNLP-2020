 $$$$$ In this notation the above equation takes the following form: Because this is a point of contrast with the parsers described in the previous section, note that all of the conditional distributions are conditioned on one lexical item (either i or h).

 $$$$$ M(c) is the constituent from which the head lexical item h is obtained according to deterministic rules that pick the head of a constituent from among the heads of its children.
 $$$$$ For example, in “united states of america”, the probability of “america” is now conditioned not just on “of” (the head of its parent) but also on “states”.
 $$$$$ Next we describe how we assign a probability to the expansion e of a constituent.
 $$$$$ Note that already our search procedure needs to revise previous most-likely-word hypotheses when the original guess makes the subsequent words very unlikely.

 $$$$$ Thus the probability of a parse is given by the equation where l(c) is the label of c (e.g., whether it is a noun phrase (np), verb phrase, etc.) and H(c) is the relevant history of c — information outside c that our probability model deems important in determining the probability in question.
 $$$$$ For the better of our two models these improvements are 24% and 14% respectively.
 $$$$$ One exception is the distribution p(e(c) j l(c), t(c), h(c), H(c)), where H only includes m and u.1 Whenever it is clear to which constituent we are referring we omit the (c) in, e.g., h(c).
 $$$$$ The grammar models did slightly better (e.g., 158.28 for the Chelba and Jelinek (C&J) parser), but it is the interpolation of the two that is clearly the winner (e.g., 137.26 for the Roark parser/trigram combination).

That is, we parse all sentences using the Charniak's parser (Charniak, 2001), relation instances are generated by iterating over all pairs of entity mentions occurring in the same sentence. $$$$$ We also suggest that improvement of the underlying parser should significantly improve the model’s perplexity and that even in the near term there is a lot of potential for improvement in immediatehead language models. are what we will call parsers in that all of the properties of the immedescendants of a constituent assigned probabilities that are conditioned on the lexical of For example, in Figure 1 the probability the into np pp conditioned on head of the “put”, as are the choices of the under the i.e., “ball” (the head of and “in” (the head of the It is the experience of the statistical parsing community that immediate-head parsers are the most accurate we can design.

The model presented by Charniak (Charniak, 2001) identifies both syntactic structural and lexical dependencies that aid in language modeling. $$$$$ First, as explicitly noted in [3], the parser does not compute the partition function (normalization constant) for its distributions so the numbers it returns are not true probabilities.

The first stage is a PCFG word-lattice parser that generates a set of candidate parses over strings in a word-lattice, while the second stage rescores these candidate edges using a lexicalized syntactic language model (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ This parsing model assigns a probability to a parse 7 by a topdown process of considering each constituent c in 7 and, for each c, first guessing the pre-terminal of c, t(c) (t for “tag”), then the lexical head of c, h(c), and then the expansion of c into further constituents e(c).
