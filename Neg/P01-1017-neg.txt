 $$$$$ First, we believe that information about rare or even truly unknown words would be useful.
 $$$$$ In anticipation of our discussion in Section 4.2, note that when we are expanding an Li we do not know the lexical items to its left, but if we properly dovetail our “guesses” we can be sure of what word, if any, appears to its right and before M, and similarly for the word to the left of Rj.
 $$$$$ As seen in Table 2, the immediate-bihead model with a perplexity of 144.98 outperforms both previous models, even though they use trigrams of words in their probability estimates.
 $$$$$ Virtually all current speech recognition systems use the so-called trigram language model in which the probability of a string is broken down into conditional probabilities on each word given On the other hand, in the last few years there has been interest in designing language models based upon parsing and Equation 2.

 $$$$$ Neither of these models uses an immediatehead parser.
 $$$$$ This is a much less powerful technique than the word-level interpolation used by both C&J and Roark, but we still observe a significant gain in performance.
 $$$$$ We now turn to this previous research.
 $$$$$ The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammarbased language model.

 $$$$$ We believe that the resulting text grossly underrepresents the useful grammatical information available to speech-recognition systems.
 $$$$$ The grammar model and the trigram model capture different facts about the distribution of words in the language, and for some set of sentences one distribution will perform better than the other.
