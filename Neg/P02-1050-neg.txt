The dependency projection method DPA (Hwa et al, 2005) based on Direct Correspondence Assumption (Hwa et al, 2002) can be described as: if there is a pair of source words with a dependency relationship, the corresponding aligned words in target sentence can be considered as having the same dependency relationship equivalently. $$$$$ That is, the thematic (who-did-what-to-whom) relationships are likely to hold true across translations evert for typologically different languages.

This idea was followed by (Hwa et al, 2002) who investigated English to Chinese projections based on the direct correspondence assumption. $$$$$ The English-Basque example (1) illustrates: if the English word buy is aligned to the Basque word erosi and gift is aligned to opari, the creation of the head-modifier relationship between buy and gift is accompanied by the creation of a corresponding head-modifier relationship between erosi and opari.

(2000) is essentially art implementation of the DCA in which relationship R has no linguistic import (i.e. anything can be a head).

Previous work has primarily focused on the projection of grammatical (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) and syntactic information (Hwa et al, 2002). $$$$$ Our experiments confirm the linguistic intuition, indicating that one cannot safely assume a direct mapping between the syntactic dependencies of one language and the syntactic dependencies of another.

We take as the starting point of annotation projection the direct correspondence assumption as formulated in (Hwa et al, 2002): for two sentences in parallel translation, the syntactic relationships in one language directly map the syntactic relationships in the other, and extend it to POS tags as well. $$$$$ (DCA): Given a pair of sentences E and F that are (literal) translations of each other with syntactic structures TreeE and TreeF, if nodes E and YE of TreeE are aligned with nodes xF and YF of TreeF, respectively, and if syntactic relationship R(x E, YE) holds in TreeE, then R(x F , YF) holds in TreeF.
