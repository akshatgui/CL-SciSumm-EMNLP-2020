The dependency projection method DPA (Hwa et al, 2005) based on Direct Correspondence Assumption (Hwa et al, 2002) can be described as $$$$$ • many-to-one if wjE, wnE E E are all uniquely aligned to WF E F, then delete all alignments between wiE (1 < i < n) and WF except for the head (denoted as whE ); moreover, if wiE , a modifier of .tchE, had its own modifiers, R(tviE, wjE) R(tch, wJF).

Analogously to Hwa et al (2002), we investigate whether there are indeed semantic correspondences between two languages, since there is little hope for projecting meaningful annotations in nonparallel semantic structures. $$$$$ Moreover, the DCA makes possible more elegant formalisms (e.g.

In a different approach, Hwa et al (2002) aligned the parallel sentences using phrase based statistical MT models and then projected the alignments back to the parse trees. $$$$$ For example, to quantify a Chinese noun with a determiner, one also needs to supply a measure word in addition to the quantity.

Many MT models implicitly make the so-called direct correspondence assumption (DCA) as defined in (Hwa et al, 2002). $$$$$ For arty derivation using this rule, if VE and NPE are the English verb and noun phrase, and they are respectively aligned with Japanese verb and noun phrase v j and NP j, then VERB-OBJECT(VE, NPE) and VERB-OBJECT(V j, NP j) mug both be true.

Since unary productions do not translate well from language to language (Hwa et al, 2002), we collapse them to their lower nodes. $$$$$ For arty derivation using this rule, if VE and NPE are the English verb and noun phrase, and they are respectively aligned with Japanese verb and noun phrase v j and NP j, then VERB-OBJECT(VE, NPE) and VERB-OBJECT(V j, NP j) mug both be true.
