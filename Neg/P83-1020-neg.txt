Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)). $$$$$ Thus, this new representation opens the way for a simple formal expression of the notion that some sentences may be vague in certain well defined ways, even though they are believed to be understood, and that this vagueness may not be resolved until a hearer's attention is called to the unresolved decision.
Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)). $$$$$ To take a commonplace example, given that &quot;John has red hair&quot; and &quot;Mr. Jones has black hair&quot;, one can be sure that John is not Mr. Jones.

This model is interesting in that it does not allow the parser to employ delay tactics, such as using a lookahead buffer (Marcus (1980), Marcus et al (1983)), or waiting for the head of a phrase to appear in the input before constructing that phrase (Abney (1987, 1989), Pritehett (1992)). $$$$$ While one could attempt to overcome this particular motivation for the two-stage parsing of NPs with some variant of the notion of pseudo-attachment (first used in [Church 801), this and related approaches have their problems too, as Church notes.

The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node. $$$$$ (11.1a) They sell INp ripe IN apples], IN pears], 1N and cherries] from local orchards].

The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node. $$$$$ These two constraints together predict that verb reanalysis is possible only when a single constituent precedes the trigger for reanalysis: Suppose that there were two constituents which preceded the trigger for reanalysis, i.e. that the order of constituents in the VP is where Cl and C2 are the two constituents, and T is the trigger.

More on Dominance Links Dominance links are quite common in tree description formalisms, where they were already in use in D-theory (Marcus et al, 1983) and in quasi-tree semantics for fb TAGs (Vijay-Shanker, 1992). $$$$$ But consider the D-theoretic analysis of (11.1); there are some surprises in store.
