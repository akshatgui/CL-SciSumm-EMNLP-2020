Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)). $$$$$ (To recast this point from an engineering point of view, this property is also a prerequisite to writing a â€¢ grammar for a subset of some given natural language which remains extensible, so that new constructions can be added to the grammar without global changes, and so that these new constructions will interact robustly with the old grammar.)

Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)). $$$$$ As viewed from the point of view of the standard referent, we believe that a D-theory parser will appear to operate, by and large, just like a tree building deterministic parser, until it creates some structure whose standard referent must be changed.
Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)). $$$$$ Furthermore, adjl is immediately to the left of and pp 1 is immediately to the right of all the nouns, so these constituents could be dominated by the same single NP that might dominate nl, n2 and n3 as well.

This model is interesting in that it does not allow the parser to employ delay tactics, such as using a lookahead buffer (Marcus (1980), Marcus et al (1983)), or waiting for the head of a phrase to appear in the input before constructing that phrase (Abney (1987, 1989), Pritehett (1992)). $$$$$ Linguists, including computational linguists, have always been fond of talking about trees.

The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node. $$$$$ Linguists, including computational linguists, have always been fond of talking about trees.
The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node. $$$$$ It turns out that Dtheory, coupled with the assumption that the parser does not interact with semantic and pragmatic processing, provides an account which is consistent with these intuitions.

More on Dominance Links Dominance links are quite common in tree description formalisms, where they were already in use in D-theory (Marcus et al, 1983) and in quasi-tree semantics for fb TAGs (Vijay-Shanker, 1992). $$$$$ We assume that the passive rule inserts a trace either immediately after a verb, or after the preposition immediately following a verb, if that preposition is lexically specified for that verb.
