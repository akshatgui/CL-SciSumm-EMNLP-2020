 $$$$$ But as Waltz and Pollack point out, it is possible that such words (e.g., writing in the context of pen ) are not explicitly present in the text under analysis, but may be inferred by the reader from the presence of other, related words (e.g., page, book, inkwell, etc.).
 $$$$$ Eventually, after a few dozen cycles, the network stabilizes in a configuration where only the sense nodes with the strongest relations to other nodes in the network are activated.

This deficiency limits the characterization of word pairs such as river bank (Wilks et al 1996) and write pen (Veronis and Ide 1990) to simple relatedness, whereas the labeled relations of MindNet specify precisely the relations river --Part -& gt; bank and write --Means --& gt; pen. $$$$$ In this paper, we describe a means for automatically building very large neural networks (VLNNs) from definition texts in machine-readable dictionaries, and demonslrate he use of these networks for word sense disambiguation.

Since the model estimation has been reduced to simple update calculations, the proposed model is similar to conventional spreading activation approaches, which have been applied, for example, to word sense disambiguation (Veronis and Ide, 1990). $$$$$ The automatic construction of VLNNs enables real-size xperiments with neural networks for natural language processing, which in turn provides insight into their behavior and design and can lead to possible improvements.
