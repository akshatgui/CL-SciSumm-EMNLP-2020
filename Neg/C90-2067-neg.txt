 $$$$$ In this paper, we describe a means for automatically building very large neural networks (VLNNs) from definition texts in machine-readable dictionaries, and demonslrate he use of these networks for word sense disambiguation.

Another related line of work is the word sense disambiguation algorithm proposed in (Veronis and Ide, 1990), where a large neural network is built by relating words through their dictionary definitions. $$$$$ The model is also more robust than the Lesk strategy, since it does not rely on the presence or absence of a particular word or words and can filter out some degree of "noise" (such as inclusion of some wrong lemmas due to lack of information about part-of-speech or occasional activation of misleading homographs).

Since the model estimation has been reduced to simple update calculations, the proposed model is similar to conventional spreading activation approaches, which have been applied, for example, to word sense disambiguation (Veronis and Ide, 1990). $$$$$ Our method brings together two earlier, independent approaches to word sense disambiguation: the use of machine-readable dictionaries and spreading and activation models.
