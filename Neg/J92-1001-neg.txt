Moreover, those relations have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994). $$$$$ To apply this information most efficiently, the approach introduces a preprocessing phase that uses preference information available prior to parsing to eliminate some of the lexical ambiguity and establish baseline preferences.

Even if most of the techniques for WSD are presented as stand-alone, it is our belief, following the ideas of (McRoy, 1992), that full-fledged lexical ambiguity resolution should combine several information sources and techniques. $$$$$ We expect to evaluate our approach on tasks in information retrieval, and, later, machine translation, to determine the likelihood of achieving substantive improvements through sense-based semantic analysis.

 $$$$$ Since the preferred interpretation also fixes the preferred sense of each word, it is at this point that the text can be given semantic tags, thus allowing sense-based information retrieval.
 $$$$$ Because determining this information accurately is knowledge-intensive, the analyzer should be as flexible as possible, requiring a minimum amount of customization for different domains.
 $$$$$ When senses share constraints (not the case in this example), they can be encoded at the level of the word entry.

 $$$$$ It is encouraging to note that, even if our encoding scheme is not entirely &quot;correct&quot; according to human intuition, as long as it is consistent, in theory it should lead to capabilities that are no worse, with zero customization, than word-based methods for information retrieval.

 $$$$$ Our approach to word sense discrimination uses information drawn from the knowledge base and the structure of the text, combining the strongest, most obvious sense preferences created by syntactic tags, word frequencies, collocations, semantic context (clusters), selectional restrictions, and syntactic cues.

 $$$$$ When a slight relaxation of the preference is satisfiable, a system should take the cautious route, and assume it has a case of overspecification and is at worst a weak failure.

We propose a tagger that makes use of several types of information (dictionary definitions, parts-of-speech, domain codes, selectional preferences and collocates) in the tradition of McRoy (McRoy, 1992) although, the information sources we use are orthogonal, unlike the sources he used, making it easier to evaluate the performance of the various modules. $$$$$ Our approach to word sense discrimination uses information drawn from the knowledge base and the structure of the text, combining the strongest, most obvious sense preferences created by syntactic tags, word frequencies, collocations, semantic context (clusters), selectional restrictions, and syntactic cues.
