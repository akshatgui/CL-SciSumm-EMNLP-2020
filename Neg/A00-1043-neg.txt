 $$$$$ For example, given a sentence &quot;The spokesperson of the University said that ...&quot;, although that-clause in the sentence may have a complicated structure and the parser gets it wrong, the reduction system is not necessarily affected since it may decide in this case to keep that-clause as it is, as humans often do, so the parsing errors will not matter in this example.

In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000). $$$$$ In that case, the task of the reduction is not to remove phrases that are extraneous in terms of the main topic of an article, but phrases that are not very relevant to users' queries.

For example, Jing (2000) trained her system on a set of 500 sentences from the Benton Foundation (http: //www.benton.org) and their reduced forms written by humans. $$$$$ The difference between these studies on text simplification and our system is that a text simplification system usually does not remove anything from an original sentence, although it may change its structure or words, but our system removes extraneous phrases from the extracted sentences.

Jing and McKeown (H. Jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed. $$$$$ One reason for this is that our probability model can hardly capture the dependencies between a particular adjective and the head noun since the training corpus is not large enough, while the other sources of information, including grammar or context information, provide little evidence on whether an adjective or an adverb should be removed.
