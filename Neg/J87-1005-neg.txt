Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987) would not be difficult. $$$$$ First, we present a proof of the termination of the algorithm.
Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987) would not be difficult. $$$$$ The syntactic structure of a sentence often manifests quite clearly the predicate-argument structure and relations of grammatical subordination.
Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987) would not be difficult. $$$$$ This paper presents, along with proofs of some of its important properties, an algorithm that generates scoped semantic forms from unscoped expressions encoding predicate-argument structure.
Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987) would not be difficult. $$$$$ Thus, from restriction (10), apply will construct the quantified wff (13) some(r, every(d, and(dept(d), in(d, <most c and(rep(r), of(r, d))), see(r, <a-few s samp(s)>)) In apply-terms, the tail recursion turns the remaining complex terms into quantifiers with wide scope.

Hobbs and Shieber (1987) extend this formalism to support operators (such as not) and present an enumeration algorithm that is more efficient than the naive wrapping approach. $$$$$ The following is the core of a COMMON LISP implementation of the deterministic algorithm which includes all but the lowest level of routines.
Hobbs and Shieber (1987) extend this formalism to support operators (such as not) and present an enumeration algorithm that is more efficient than the naive wrapping approach. $$$$$ For instance, the algorithm generates two readings for the sentence Everyone isn't here. corresponding to the two relative scopings of the universal quantifier and the negation.
Hobbs and Shieber (1987) extend this formalism to support operators (such as not) and present an enumeration algorithm that is more efficient than the naive wrapping approach. $$$$$ Wff (9) will ultimately generate the two readings in which variables d and c outscope r. Wff (10) is also partial as it still contains a complex term.
Hobbs and Shieber (1987) extend this formalism to support operators (such as not) and present an enumeration algorithm that is more efficient than the naive wrapping approach. $$$$$ Condition 3: Again, the absence of complex terms in a causes the call to apply-terms to return with result a, and p(a) = 0, so the condition holds.

The sentence has 42 readings (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987), and it is easy to imagine how the number of readings grows exponentially (or worse) in the length of the sentence. $$$$$ Form ==> a term or a wff with in-Place complex terms ScopedForm <== Form with opaque argument positions recursively scoped Scopes arguments of the given Form recursively.
The sentence has 42 readings (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987), and it is easy to imagine how the number of readings grows exponentially (or worse) in the length of the sentence. $$$$$ Proof of these five statements does not constitute a proof of correctness, but provides motivation for assuming the correctness of the algorithm.
The sentence has 42 readings (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987), and it is easy to imagine how the number of readings grows exponentially (or worse) in the length of the sentence. $$$$$ By induction, V(I) = v, also.
The sentence has 42 readings (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987), and it is easy to imagine how the number of readings grows exponentially (or worse) in the length of the sentence. $$$$$ But we can get around this if, following the approach taken by Hobbs (1983), we take a donkey to be generic, take it to refer to the unique generic donkey that m owns, and assume that to beat a generic donkey is to beat all its instances.

In summary, however, the analysis is slightly more restrictive than that of Hobbs and Shieber (1987), making predictions regarding the scope of topicalized or wh-moved constituents, relative scope of embedded quantifiers, and possibly even syntactic structure of complex NPs. $$$$$ Since s does not include t (which binds x) but does include x, U(s) = 1x1 U u.

For example, in processing (22) (adapted from Hobbs and Shieber 1987), which Park 1995 claims to have only four readings, rather than the five predicted by their account, such a system can build both readings for the S/NP every representative of three companies saw and decide which is more likely, before building both compatible readings of the whole sentence and similarly resolving with respect to statistical or contextual support $$$$$ Proof sketch: The proof is by a simple induction on the length of the expression, and uses the base case for conditions 3 and 4 proved above.
