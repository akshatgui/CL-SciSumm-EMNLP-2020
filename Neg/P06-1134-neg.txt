In recent years, Akkaya et al (2009) report a successful empirical result where WSD helps improving sentiment analysis, while Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) study the distinction between objectivity and subjectivity in each different sense of a word, and their empirical effects in the context of sentiment analysis. $$$$$ Though both of these areas are concerned with the semantics of a text, over time there has been little interaction, if any, between them.

In recent years, Akkaya et al (2009) report a successful empirical result where WSD helps improving sentiment analysis, while Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) study the distinction between objectivity and subjectivity in each different sense of a word, and their empirical effects in the context of sentiment analysis. $$$$$ The second is subjectivity classification of sentences, clauses, phrases, or word instances in the context of a particular text or conversation, either subjective/objective classifications or positive/negative sentiment classifications (e.g.,(Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Dave et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004)).

 $$$$$ This paper explores their interaction, and brings empirical evidence in support of the hypotheses that (1) subjectivity is a property that can be associated with word senses, and (2) word sense disambiguation can directly benefit from subjectivity annotations.
 $$$$$ Adding subjectivity labels to WordNet could also support automatic subjectivity analysis.
 $$$$$ We experiment with two different values, namely 100 and 160 top-ranked distributionally similar words.
 $$$$$ Though both of these areas are concerned with the semantics of a text, over time there has been little interaction, if any, between them.

As an example, Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) prove that subjectivity information for WordNet senses can improve word sense disambiguation tasks for subjectivity ambiguous words (such as positive). $$$$$ Specifically, we use the current word and its partof-speech, a local context of three words to the left and right of the ambiguous word, the parts-ofspeech of the surrounding words, and a global context implemented through sense-specific keywords determined as a list of at most five words occurring at least three times in the contexts defining a certain word sense.
As an example, Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) prove that subjectivity information for WordNet senses can improve word sense disambiguation tasks for subjectivity ambiguous words (such as positive). $$$$$ We saw a number of subjective expressions in Section 2.

As an example, Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) prove that subjectivity information for WordNet senses can improve word sense disambiguation tasks for subjectivity ambiguous words (such as positive). $$$$$ Section 5 provided evidence that automatic subjectivity classification may improve word sense disambiguation performance, but mainly for words with both subjective and objective senses.

Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective. $$$$$ A third obvious question is, can word sense disambiguation help automatic subjectivity analysis?

We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ Senses are classified as S(ubjective), O(bjective), or B(oth).
We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ We use the rule-based subjective sentence classifier of (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) to assign an S, O, or B label to all the training and test examples pertaining to these ambiguous words.
We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ Considering only the 16-word subset with both S and O senses (according to Judge 1), r. is .75, and for the 16-word subset for which Judge 1 gave only S or only O senses, r. is .73.

First, (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ There is growing interest in the automatic extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text (subjectivity), to provide tools and support for various NLP applications.
First, (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ As a baseline, we use an “informed” random assignment of subjectivity labels, which randomly assigns S labels to word senses in the data set, such that the maximum number of S assignments equals the number of correct S labels in the gold standard data set.
First, (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ In contrast, our end task (in Section 4) is to assign subjectivity labels to word senses.
First, (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ As we saw, performance may even degrade for words that do not.

We adopt the definitions of subjective and objective from Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) (hereafter WM). $$$$$ Overall for the entire set of ambiguous words, the error reduction is measured at 2.2% (significant at p < 0.1 paired t-test).

We adopt the definitions of subjective and objective from Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) (hereafter WM). $$$$$ The corpus we use is the MPQA Opinion Corpus, which consists of over 10,000 sentences from the world press annotated for subjective expressions (all three types of subjective expressions described in Section 2).6 Algorithm 1 is our method for calculating sense subjectivity scores.
We adopt the definitions of subjective and objective from Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) (hereafter WM). $$$$$ The editors of the left-leaning paper attacked the new House Speaker.

 $$$$$ Subjectivity labels would be a useful source of information when manually augmenting the lexical knowledge in a dictionary, e.g., when choosing hypernyms for senses or deciding which senses to eliminate when defining a coarse-grained sense inventory (if there is a subjective sense, at least one should be retained).
 $$$$$ Even so, the r. value for them is 0.71, which is not substantially lower.
 $$$$$ Next, for each sense wsz of the word w, we determine the similarity with each of the words in the list DSW, using a WordNet-based measure of semantic similarity (wnss).

We adopt the definitions from (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), who describe the annotation scheme as follows. $$$$$ This paper explores their interaction, and brings empirical evidence in support of the hypotheses that (1) subjectivity is a property that can be associated with word senses, and (2) word sense disambiguation can directly benefit from subjectivity annotations.

We adopt the definitions from (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), who describe the annotation scheme as follows. $$$$$ Note, however, that (McCarthy et al., 2004) used the information about distributionally similar words to approximate corpus frequencies for word senses, whereas we target the estimation of a property of a given word sense (the “subjectivity”).

As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ : absorb, suck, imbibe, soak up, sop up, suck up, draw, take in, take up – (take in, also metaphorically; “The sponge absorbs water well”; “She drew strength from the minister’s words”) Manual subjectivity judgments were added to a total of 354 senses (64 words).
As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ Second, uncertainty can arise in weighing hypernym against sense.
As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ While these sentences contain objective senses of alarm and boil, the sentences are subjective nonetheless.
As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ For this tagging task, U tags were not allowed, to create a definitive gold standard for the experiments.

 $$$$$ It is fine for a synset to imply just S or O, while the hypernym implies both (the synset specializes the more general concept).
 $$$$$ While the current setting considered a pipeline approach, where the output of a subjectivity annotation system was fed to the input of a method for semantic disambiguation, future work could also consider the role of word senses as a possible way of improving subjectivity analysis, or simultaneous annotations of subjectivity and word meanings, as done in the past for other language processing problems.
 $$$$$ If we were to use Judge 2’s tags instead of Judge 1’s, only one word would change: source would move from the top to the bottom of the table. without subjectivity information, for the set of ambiguous nouns in SENSEVAL-3 For the words that have both S and O senses, the addition of the subjectivity feature alone can bring a significant error rate reduction of 4.3% (p < 0.05 paired t-test).
 $$$$$ Subjectivity and meaning are both important properties of language.

Both (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) and (SuandMarkert, 2008) show that even reliable subjectivity clues have objective senses. $$$$$ A general covering term for such states is private state, “a state that is not open to objective observation or verification” (Quirk et al., 1985).1 There are three main types of subjective expressions:2 His alarm grew.

They have shown that subjectivity annotations can be helpful for word sense disambiguation when a word has distinct subjective senses and objective senses (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006). $$$$$ First, as indicated above, after calculating the semantic similarity of the distributionally similar words with each sense, we can either use all the distributionally similar words for the calculation of the subjectivity score of each sense (similarityall), or we can use only those that lead to the highest similarity (similarity-selected).

They have shown that subjectivity annotations can be helpful for word sense disambiguation when a word has distinct subjective senses and objective senses (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006). $$$$$ To answer this question, we augment an existing data-driven word sense disambiguation system with a feature reflecting the subjectivity of the examples where the ambiguous word occurs, and evaluate the performance of the new subjectivity-aware classifier as compared to the traditional context-based sense classifier.

 $$$$$ There are several other ways our results could impact future work.
 $$$$$ Second, can automatic subjectivity analysis be used to improve word sense disambiguation?
 $$$$$ As it turns out, a correlation can indeed be established between these two semantic properties of language.

 $$$$$ Moreover, the end task of that work was to annotate words, while our end task is the more difficult problem of annotating word senses for subjectivity.

Towards this, Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) conduct a study on human annotation of 354 words senses with polarity and report a high inter-annotator agreement. $$$$$ We also include a surrounding context of two additional sentences, because the classifier considers some contextual information.
