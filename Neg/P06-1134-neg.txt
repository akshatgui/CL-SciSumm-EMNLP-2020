 $$$$$ Tying the pieces of this paper together, once the senses in a dictionary have been assigned subjectivity labels, a word sense disambiguation system could consult them to decide whether it should consider or ignore the subjectivity feature.
 $$$$$ This paper explores their interaction, and brings empirical evidence in support of the hypotheses that (1) subjectivity is a property that can be associated with word senses, and (2) word sense disambiguation can directly benefit from subjectivity annotations.
 $$$$$ Similarly, there is continuous interest in the task of word sense disambiguation, with sense-annotated resources being developed for many languages, and a growing number of research groups participating in large-scale evaluations such as SENSEVAL.
 $$$$$ Subjectivity and meaning are both important properties of language.

As an example, Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) prove that subjectivity information for WordNet senses can improve word sense disambiguation tasks for subjectivity ambiguous words (such as positive). $$$$$ We experiment with two different values, namely 100 and 160 top-ranked distributionally similar words.
As an example, Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) prove that subjectivity information for WordNet senses can improve word sense disambiguation tasks for subjectivity ambiguous words (such as positive). $$$$$ For 12.3% of the senses, at least one annotator’s tag is U.

Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective. $$$$$ Subjective expressions are words and phrases being used to express opinions, emotions, evaluations, speculations, etc.
Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective. $$$$$ Finally, classifying a sense as B means it covers both subjective and objective usages, e.g.
Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective. $$$$$ While a threshold of 0 seems like a sensible choice, we perform the evaluation for different thresholds ranging across the [-1,+1] interval, and correspondingly determine the precision of the algorithm at different points of recall7.
Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective. $$$$$ Addressing the first question of whether subjectivity is a property that can be assigned to word senses, we showed that good agreement (r.=0.74) can be achieved between human annotators labeling the subjectivity of senses.

We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ As shown in this figure, the precisionrecall curves for our algorithm are clearly above the “informed” baseline, indicating the ability of our algorithm to automatically identify subjective word senses.
We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ The third exploits automatic subjectivity analysis in applications such as review classification (e.g., (Turney, 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004)), mining texts for product reviews (e.g., (Yi et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005)), summarization (e.g., (Kim and Hovy, 2004)), information extraction (e.g., (Riloff et al., 2005)), and question answering (e.g., (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Stoyanov et al., 2005)).
We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ If we were to use Judge 2’s tags instead of Judge 1’s, only one word would change: source would move from the top to the bottom of the table. without subjectivity information, for the set of ambiguous nouns in SENSEVAL-3 For the words that have both S and O senses, the addition of the subjectivity feature alone can bring a significant error rate reduction of 4.3% (p < 0.05 paired t-test).

First, (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) provide evidence that word sense labels, together with contextual subjectivity analysis, can be exploited to improve performance in word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ Second, uncertainty can arise in weighing hypernym against sense.

We adopt the definitions of subjective and objective from Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) (hereafter WM). $$$$$ In contrast, our end task (in Section 4) is to assign subjectivity labels to word senses.

 $$$$$ Our hypothesis motivating the use of a sentence-level subjectivity classifier is that instances of subjective senses are more likely to be in subjective sentences, and thus that sentence subjectivity is an informative feature for the disambiguation of words having both subjective and objective senses.

We adopt the definitions from (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), who describe the annotation scheme as follows. $$$$$ Senses are classified as S(ubjective), O(bjective), or B(oth).
We adopt the definitions from (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), who describe the annotation scheme as follows. $$$$$ Finally, there could be different strategies for exploiting subjectivity annotations and word sense.

As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ We use a word sense disambiguation system that integrates both local and topical features.
As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ The first is identifying words and phrases that are associated with subjectivity, for example, that think is associated with private states and that beautiful is associated with positive sentiments (e.g., (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Wiebe, 2000; Kamps and Marx, 2002; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005)).

 $$$$$ Second, a number of methods for subjectivity or sentiment analysis start with a set of seed words and then search through WordNet to find other subjective words (Kamps and Marx, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).
 $$$$$ The labels for the senses of noun assault are (O:O,O:O,O:O,O:UO).4 For verb assault there is a subjective sense: attack, round, assail, lash out, snipe, assault (attack in speech or writing) “The editors of the left-leaning paper attacked the new House Speaker” However, there is no corresponding sense for 4I.e., the first three were labeled O by both annotators.
 $$$$$ The evaluation is therefore performed on a total of 272 word senses.
 $$$$$ This paper explores their interaction, and brings empirical evidence in support of the hypotheses that (1) subjectivity is a property that can be associated with word senses, and (2) word sense disambiguation can directly benefit from subjectivity annotations.

Both (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) and (SuandMarkert, 2008) show that even reliable subjectivity clues have objective senses. $$$$$ Subjectivity and meaning are both important properties of language.

They have shown that subjectivity annotations can be helpful for word sense disambiguation when a word has distinct subjective senses and objective senses (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006). $$$$$ Among the 16 that do not have both S and O senses, 8 have only S senses and 8 have only O senses.

Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) and Su and Markert (2008) both show that this is a well-defined concept via human annotation as well as automatic recognition. $$$$$ While much work remains to be done, this first attempt has proved the feasibility of correctly assigning subjectivity labels to the fine-grained level of word senses.

 $$$$$ First, can subjectivity labels be assigned to word senses?
 $$$$$ While much work remains to be done, this first attempt has proved the feasibility of correctly assigning subjectivity labels to the fine-grained level of word senses.

 $$$$$ We devise an algorithm relying on distributionally similar words to calculate a subjectivity score, and show how it can be used to automatically assess the subjectivity of a word sense.
 $$$$$ Table 1 shows the contingency table for the two annotators’ judgments on this data.
 $$$$$ It is fine for a synset to imply just S or O, while the hypernym implies both (the synset specializes the more general concept).
