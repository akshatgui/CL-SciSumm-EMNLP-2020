The discourse grammar used builds on [Polanyi and Scha 1984]. $$$$$ In 413 this way, we can describe &quot;intrusions&quot;, &quot;asides to third parties&quot;, and other interruptions of one Interaction by another.

Such structures have received considerable attention and their models are often referred to as discourse/dialogue grammars (Polanyi and Scha, 1984) or conversational/dialogue games (Levin and Moore, 1988). $$$$$ This grammar, the &quot;Dynamic Discourse Model&quot;, uses an Augmented Transition Network parsing mechanism to build a representation of the semantics of a discourse in a stepwise fashion, from left to right, on the basis of the semantic representations of the individual clauses which constitute the discourse.
Such structures have received considerable attention and their models are often referred to as discourse/dialogue grammars (Polanyi and Scha, 1984) or conversational/dialogue games (Levin and Moore, 1988). $$$$$ This section reviews some important ways in which clauses (being our elementary discourse constituent units) can be combined to form complex discourse constituent units (which, in most cases, may be further combined to form larger dcu' s, by recursive application of the same mechanisms).
Such structures have received considerable attention and their models are often referred to as discourse/dialogue grammars (Polanyi and Scha, 1984) or conversational/dialogue games (Levin and Moore, 1988). $$$$$ For instance, a dcu may be interrupted by a clause which initiates another Interaction.

It is also closer to some methods for incremental daptation of discourse structures, where additions are allowed to the right-frontier of a tree structure (e.g. Polanyi and Scha 1984). $$$$$ In the first case, the same dcu is resumed and all its register values are still available; in the second case, the first story has been finished before the discussion and the re-entry into a storyworld is via a different story.
It is also closer to some methods for incremental daptation of discourse structures, where additions are allowed to the right-frontier of a tree structure (e.g. Polanyi and Scha 1984). $$$$$ Now I think I got everything.&quot; (Transcript by Ehrich and Koster (1983), translated from Dutch; the constituents we left out, indicated by parenthesized dots, are subordinated constituents appended to the NP they follow.)
It is also closer to some methods for incremental daptation of discourse structures, where additions are allowed to the right-frontier of a tree structure (e.g. Polanyi and Scha 1984). $$$$$ In the description of discourse semantics, the level of the dcu's (including the adjacency structures) plays the most central role: at this level the system defines how the semantic representation of a complex discourse constituent is constructed out of the semantic representations of its parts.
