The discourse grammar used builds on [Polanyi and Scha 1984]. $$$$$ Narratives may be seen as a special case of lists -- successive event clauses specify what happens at successive timepoints in the world described by the narrative.
The discourse grammar used builds on [Polanyi and Scha 1984]. $$$$$ One general point we should like to make here already: sequences as well as expansions correspond to extensional semantic operations.
The discourse grammar used builds on [Polanyi and Scha 1984]. $$$$$ Examples are: lists, narrative structures, and various binary structures (&quot;A but B&quot;, &quot;A because B&quot;, etc.).

Such structures have received considerable attention and their models are often referred to as discourse/dialogue grammars (Polanyi and Scha, 1984) or conversational/dialogue games (Levin and Moore, 1988). $$$$$ The meaning of most clause utterances cannot be determined on the basis of the clause alone, but involves register values of the embedding dcu -as when a question sets up a frame in terms of which its answer is interpreted (cf.

It is also closer to some methods for incremental daptation of discourse structures, where additions are allowed to the right-frontier of a tree structure (e.g. Polanyi and Scha 1984). $$$$$ Arcs have labels of the form &quot;A:B&quot; (or sometimes just &quot;A&quot;), where A indicates the category of the constituent which must be parsed to traverse the arc, and B is a label identifying additional conditions and/or actions.
