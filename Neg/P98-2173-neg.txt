One important source of inspiration for GF was the WYSIWYM system (Power and Scott 1998), which used domain-specific interlinguas and produced excellent quality in multilingual generation. $$$$$ However, if satisfactory large-scale implementations prove feasible, the method brings many potential benefits.

querying Conceptual authoring through WYSIWYM editing alleviates the need for expensive syntactic and semantic processing of the queries by providing the users with an interface for editing the conceptual meaning of a query instead of the surface text (Power and Scott, 1998). $$$$$ WYSIWYM editing is a new idea that requires practical testing.

The "WYSIWYM" approach was proposed ([Power and Scott, 1998], [Paris and Vander Linden, 1996]) as a system design methodology where users author and manipulate an underlying logical form through a user interface that provides feedback in natural language text. $$$$$ Documentation of the knowledge base, often a tedious and time-consuming task, becomes automatic.

The system belongs to the family of WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) (Power and Scott, 1998) text generation systems: logical forms are entered interactively and the corresponding linguistic realization of the expressions is generated in several languages. $$$$$ Speakers of several different languages could collectively edit the same knowledge base, each user viewing and modifying the knowledge in his/her own language. navigated by the methods familiar from books and from complex electronic documents (e.g. contents page, index, hypertext links), obviating any need for special training in navigation.
