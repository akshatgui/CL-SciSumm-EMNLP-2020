Paper will be implemented in ICONOCLAST, an authoring tool which enables domain experts to create a knowledge base through a sequence of interactive choice and generates hiexarchitally structured text according to various tylistic constraints (See Power and Scott 1998). $$$$$ • As a result, WYSIWYM editing is ideal for facilitating knowledge sharing and transfer within a multilingual project.

One important source of inspiration for GF was the WYSIWYM system (Power and Scott 1998), which used domain-specific interlinguas and produced excellent quality in multilingual generation. $$$$$ For MT, information extraction is a major difficulty, since the meaning must be derived by analysis of the source text; M-NLG avoids this difficulty but seems at first sight to require an expensive phase of knowledge engineering in order to encode the meaning.

One important source of inspiration for GF was the WYSIWYM system (Power and Scott 1998), which used domain-specific interlinguas and produced excellent quality in multilingual generation. $$$$$ We are currently evaluating the usability of these systems, partly to confirm that authors do indeed find them easy to use, and partly to investigate issues in the design of feedback texts.

The MDA (Multilingual Document Authoring) system [Brun et al2000] is an instance (descended from Ranta's Grammatical Framework [Ranta 2002]) of a text-mediated interactive natural language generation system, a notion introduced by [Power and Scott 1998] under the name of WYSIWYM. $$$$$ However, if satisfactory large-scale implementations prove feasible, the method brings many potential benefits.

querying Conceptual authoring through WYSIWYM editing alleviates the need for expensive syntactic and semantic processing of the queries by providing the users with an interface for editing the conceptual meaning of a query instead of the surface text (Power and Scott, 1998). $$$$$ A 'feedback text', generated from a possibly incomplete knowledge base, describes in natural language the knowledge encoded so far, and the options for extending it.

The "WYSIWYM" approach was proposed ([Power and Scott, 1998], [Paris and Vander Linden, 1996]) as a system design methodology where users author and manipulate an underlying logical form through a user interface that provides feedback in natural language text. $$$$$ Two approaches have been adopted: Machine Translation (MT) of a source text, and Multilingual Natural Language Generation (M-NLG) from a knowledge base.

The system belongs to the family of WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) (Power and Scott, 1998) text generation systems $$$$$ There are obvious reasons for trying to automate the production of multilingual documentation, especially for routine subject-matter in restricted domains (e.g. technical instructions).
The system belongs to the family of WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) (Power and Scott, 1998) text generation systems $$$$$ It is not only costly but timeconsuming, often delaying the release of the product in some markets; also the quality is uneven and hard to control (Hartley and Paris, 1997).

Wysiwym (What You See Is What You Meant) is a user-interface technology through which a domain expert can formally encode knowledge by structured editing of an automatically generated feedback text (Power and Scott, 1998). $$$$$ New linguistic styles can also be added (e.g. a terminology suitable for novices rather than experts).
