In theory, stochastic tree transducers and some versions of synchronous grammars provide solutions for the non-isomorphic tree based transduction problem and hence possible solutions for MT. Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars, proposed by (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), were introduced primarily for semantics but were later also proposed for translation. $$$$$ ~Thus, a synchronous TAG (like the grammar presented in Figure 1) whose semantic component forms a TAG with this property necessarily obeys the regular language constraint on long-distance semantic dependencies.

The statements of dependencies and recursion pos- sibilities in a tree are factored, the former following from primitive dependencies in elementary trees, the latter a consequence of an operatkm of adjunc- tion of trees.

For example, Synchronous TAGs, proposed by (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), which were introduced primarily for semantics but were later also proposed for translation. $$$$$ For instance, mid- way in parsing a sentence, at a point at which a single quantified NP has been analyzed, the incremental inter- pretation could not possibly represent all possible scop- ings that that quantifier might end up taking, as it is not known what the quantifier might be required to scope with respect o. At the point in the parse where the scoping decision can be made, it is not clear whether an inerementality requirement would mean that the variant scopings must all be explicitly generated at that point, or only implicitly generable.

Recently there is a swing back to incorporating more linguistic information again, but this time linguistic insight carefully guides the setup of empirically learned models. Shieber (2007) recently argued that probabilistic Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) have the right combination of properties that satisfy both linguists and empirical MT practitioners. $$$$$ In this paper, we present a varim~t of TAGs, called synchronous TAGs, which characterize correstxmdences between languages.
