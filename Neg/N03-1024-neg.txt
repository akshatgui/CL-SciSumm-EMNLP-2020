Evaluation is sped up by using a compact word lattice view for eliciting human judgments, built using the syntactic fusion algorithm of (Pang et al, 2003). $$$$$ That is, supposed we just merged nodes A and B, and they are expanded with the same syntactic rule into A1A2...An and B1B2...Bn respectively; before we merge each Ai with Bi, we check for each Bi if its keyword list shares common words with any Aj (j =� i).

 $$$$$ Our 4-gram based language model will not find any fault with this sentence.
 $$$$$ For example, when given as input the same sentences in Figure 1, one instantiation of the MSA algorithm produces the FSA in Figure 3, which contains many “bad” paths such as the battle of last week’s fighting took at least 12 people lost their people died in the fighting last week’s fighting (See Section 4.2.2 for a more quantitative analysis.).

In the automatic evaluation of machine translation, paraphrases may help to alleviate problems presented by the fact that there are often alternative and equally valid ways of translating a text (Pang et al, 2003). $$$$$ But it does mean that our FSAs produce sentences that look more like human produced sentences than machine produced ones according to a language model.
