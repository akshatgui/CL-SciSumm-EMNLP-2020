 $$$$$ We give the definition of CDG in the next section.
 $$$$$ Grammar rules are constraints on word-to-word modifications, and parsing is done by adding the constraints to a data structure called a constraint network.
 $$$$$ present a new grammatical formalism called Con- Dependency Grammar in which every rule is given constraint on wordto-word modifications.
 $$$$$ CDG is actually being used for an interactive Japanese parser of a Japanese-to-English machine translation system for a newspaper domain (Maruyama et. al.

An architecture which fulfills this requirement is Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by Maruyama (1990) and later extended with weights (Schroeder, 2002). $$$$$ The complexity of adding new constraints to a constraint network never exceeds the complexity of the initial formation of a constraint network, so it is also bounded by 0(0).
An architecture which fulfills this requirement is Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by Maruyama (1990) and later extended with weights (Schroeder, 2002). $$$$$ Since the number of arcs is at most 0((nk)2), filtering can be performed in 0Unk)2(n1)2), which is 0(n4) without grammatical constants.
An architecture which fulfills this requirement is Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by Maruyama (1990) and later extended with weights (Schroeder, 2002). $$$$$ This sets the P2-P2 element of the matrix PP3-PP4 to zero.

Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ Thus, sentence (1) is generated by the grammar GI.
Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ Given an assignment A, the label and the modifiee of a role x are determined.
Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ Parsing and successive disambiguation are performed by adding new constraints to the constraint network.

Using constraint satisfaction techniques for natural language parsing was introduced first in (Maruyama, 1990) by defining a constraint dependency grammar (CDG) that maps nicely on the notion of a CSP. $$$$$ Although there is no context-free grammar that generates Lww, the grammar Gww =< E, L, R, C > shown in Figure 9 generates it (Maruyama 1990).
