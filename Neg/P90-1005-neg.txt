 $$$$$ A role can have nx possible values, where 1 is the size of L, so the maximum domain size is ax 1.
 $$$$$ Thus, sentence (1) is generated by the grammar GI.
 $$$$$ The generative capacity and the computational complexity of this formalism are not clear.
 $$$$$ On the other hand, any context-free language can be generated by a degree=2 CDG.

An architecture which fulfills this requirement is Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by Maruyama (1990) and later extended with weights (Schroeder, 2002). $$$$$ Binary constraints may be imposed on arbitrary pairs of roles, and therefore the number of constraint matrices is at most proportional to (nk)2.

An architecture which fulfills this requirement is Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by Maruyama (1990) and later extended with weights (Schroeder, 2002). $$$$$ To illustrate how we can add new constraints to narrow down the ambiguity, let us introduce additional constraints (G2b-1) and (G2b-2), assuming that appropriate syntactic and/or semantic features are attached to each word and that the function NO is provided to access these features.
An architecture which fulfills this requirement is Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by Maruyama (1990) and later extended with weights (Schroeder, 2002). $$$$$ A parser for such a wide domain should make use of any kind of information available to the system, including user-supplied information.

Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ We can graphically represent the parsing result of sentence (1) as shown in Figure 3 if we interpret the governor rote of a word as a pointer to the syntactic governor of the word.
Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ This, combined with the fact that Gww generates Lww, means that the weak generative capacity of CDG with degree=2 is strictly greater than that of CFG.
Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ CDG parsing is formalized as a constraint satisfaction problem over a finite domain so that efficient constraint-propagation algorithms can be employed to reduce structural ambiguity without generating individual parse trees.

Using constraint satisfaction techniques for natural language parsing was introduced first in (Maruyama, 1990) by defining a constraint dependency grammar (CDG) that maps nicely on the notion of a CSP. $$$$$ Every solution that satisfies all the constraints simultaneously corresponds to an individual parse tree.
