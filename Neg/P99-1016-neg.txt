See Caraballo (1999) for a detailed description of a method to construct such a hierarchy. $$$$$ With the addition of some improvements we have identified, we believe that these automatic methods can be used to construct truly useful hierarchies.

In Caraballo (1999), we construct a hierarchy of nouns, including hypernym relations. $$$$$ Both of these projects have the goal of building a single cluster of, e.g., vehicles, and both use seed words to initialize a cluster with nouns belonging to it.

Caraballo (1999) proposed the first attempt, which used conjunction and apposition features to build noun clusters. $$$$$ Although it is possible that a reasonable tree structure could be created with subtrees of, say, European countries, Asian countries, etc., recall that we are using single-word hypernyms.

Caraballo (1999) uses a hierarchical clustering technique to build a hyponymy hierarchy of nouns. $$$$$ Taking the head words of each NP and stemming them results in data for about 50,000 distinct nouns.

The built-in ambiguity in the hyponymy hierarchy presented in (Caraballo, 1999) is primarily an effect of the fact that all information is composed into one tree. $$$$$ As suggested in Hearst (1992), we can find some hypernym data in the text by looking for conjunctions involving the word &quot;other&quot;, as in &quot;X, Y, and other Zs&quot; (patterns 3 and 4 in Hearst).
The built-in ambiguity in the hyponymy hierarchy presented in (Caraballo, 1999) is primarily an effect of the fact that all information is composed into one tree. $$$$$ We want to create a tree of all of the nouns in this data using standard bottom-up clustering techniques as follows: Put each noun into its own node.

As was also reported by Caraballo (1999), the judges sometimes found proper nouns (as hyponyms) hard to evaluate. $$$$$ (Obviously, the tree will no longer be binary).

It is difficult to compare these results with results from other studies such as that of Caraballo (1999), as the data used is not the same. $$$$$ The internal nodes of the resulting tree are then labeled with hypernyms for the nouns clustered underneath them, also based on data extracted from the Wall Street Journal.

It is difficult to compare these results with results from other studies such as that of Caraballo (1999), as the data used is not the same. $$$$$ In our current tree, the best hypernym for the entire tree is &quot;product&quot;; however, many times nodes deeper in the tree are given this label also.

Caraballo (1999) let three judges evaluate ten internal nodes in the hyponymy hierarchy that had at least twenty descendants. $$$$$ Since the hierarchy is learned from sample text, it could be trained on domainspecific text to create a hierarchy that is more applicable to a particular domain than a general-purpose resource such as WordNet.
Caraballo (1999) let three judges evaluate ten internal nodes in the hyponymy hierarchy that had at least twenty descendants. $$$$$ We would like to combine these subtrees into a single parent labeled &quot;country&quot; or &quot;nation&quot;, with each country appearing as a leaf directly beneath this parent.
Caraballo (1999) let three judges evaluate ten internal nodes in the hyponymy hierarchy that had at least twenty descendants. $$$$$ The reason for this is that few of the nouns appear with hypernyms, and two of them (Giulini and Ozawa) appear in the same phrase listing conductors, thus giving &quot;conductor&quot; a count of two, sufficient to be listed as the only hypernym for the cluster.
Caraballo (1999) let three judges evaluate ten internal nodes in the hyponymy hierarchy that had at least twenty descendants. $$$$$ Nouns which have a cosine of 0 with every other noun are not included in the final tree.

In Section 4, we show how correctly extracted relationships can be used as "seed-cases" to extract several more relationships, thus improving recall; this work shares some similarities with that of Caraballo (1999). $$$$$ Our work develops a labeled hierarchy based on a text corpus.

In Section 4, we show how correctly extracted relationships can be used as "seed-cases" to extract several more relationships, thus improving recall; this work shares some similarities with that of Caraballo (1999). $$$$$ Following WordNet, a word A is said to be a hypernym of a word B if native speakers of English accept the sentence &quot;B is a (kind of) A.&quot; To determine possible hypernyms for a particular noun, we use the same parsed text described in the previous section.
In Section 4, we show how correctly extracted relationships can be used as "seed-cases" to extract several more relationships, thus improving recall; this work shares some similarities with that of Caraballo (1999). $$$$$ In practice, we cannot follow exactly that algorithm, because maintaining a list of the cosines between every pair of nodes requires a tremendous amount of memory.

Another definition is given by Caraballo (1999). $$$$$ The hyponym-hypernym pairs found by Hearst's algorithm include some that Hearst describes as &quot;context and point-of-view dependent,&quot; such as &quot;Washington/nationalist&quot; and &quot;aircraft/target&quot; .
Another definition is given by Caraballo (1999). $$$$$ For any noun that was not evaluated by at least two judges, we evaluated the noun/hypernym pair by examining the appearances of that noun in the source text and verifying that the hypernym was correct for the predominant sense of the noun.

First of all, it would be interesting to apply LSA to a system for building an entire hypernym-labelled ontology in roughly the way described in (Caraballo, 1999), perhaps by using an LSA-weighted voting method to determine which hypernym would be used to label each node. $$$$$ This work goes a step further by automatically creating not just clusters of related words, but a hierarchy of nouns and their hypernyms, akin to the hand-built hierarchy in WordNet.

So, many attempts have been made to automatically produce taxonomies (Grefenstette, 1994), but (Caraballo, 1999) is certainly the first work which proposes a complete overview of the problem by (1) automatically building a hierarchical structure of nouns based on bottom-up clustering methods and (2) labeling the internal nodes of the resulting tree with hypernyms from the nouns clustered underneath by using patterns such as B is a kind of A. $$$$$ The next level of the hierarchy, the children of the root, is as shown in Table 1.

Contrary, domain specific terms don't tend to be modified by other words, because they have sufficient information in themselves (Caraballo, 1999B). $$$$$ The &quot;Hypernym 1&quot; column indicates whether the &quot;best&quot; hypernym was considered correct, while the &quot;Any hypernym&quot; column indicates whether any of the listed hypernyms were accepted.
