Moreover, the TEASE collection of entailment rules (Szpektor et al, 2004) consists of 136 templates provided as input, plus all the learned templates. $$$$$ Our research goal is to approach unsupervised acquisition of such a full scale KB.

 $$$$$ It also indicates that there is potential for acquiring additional templates per pivot, which would require further research on broadening efficiently the search for additional web data per pivot.
 $$$$$ In future work we aim to improve the yield by increasing the size of the sample-corpus in a qualitative way, as well as precision, using statistical methods such as supervised learning for better anchor set identification and cross-correlation between different pivots.
 $$$$$ However, its processing time increases exponentially with the size of the templates.

TEASE (Szpektor et al, 2004) discovers binary relation templates from the Web base don sets of representative entities for given binary relation templates. $$$$$ Together with the fact that we expect to find entailment relations for about 85% of a lexicon, it is a significant step towards scalability, indicating that we will be able to extract a large scale KB for a large scale lexicon.
