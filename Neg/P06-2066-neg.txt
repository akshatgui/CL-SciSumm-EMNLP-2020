Unlike acyclicity and the single head constraints, which impose restrictions on the dependency relation as such, projectivity constrains the interaction between the dependency relations and the order of the nodes in the sentence (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006). $$$$$ However, our purely quantitative experiments cannot answer the question, which of the two measures yields the more informative clusters.
