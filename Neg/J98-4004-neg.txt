Structural contexts like those captured by parent annotation (Johnson, 1998) are more subtle. $$$$$ Returning to the theoretical analysis, the relative frequency counts C1 and the nonunit production probability estimates Pi for the PCFG induced from this two-tree corpus are as follows: Of course, in a real treebank the counts of all these productions would also include their occurrences in other constructions, so the theoretical analysis presented here is but a crude idealization.
Structural contexts like those captured by parent annotation (Johnson, 1998) are more subtle. $$$$$ This paper points out that the Penn II treebank representations are of the kind predicted to have such an effect, and describes a simple node relabeling transformation that improves a treebank PCFG-based parser's average precision and recall by around 8%, or approximately half of the performance difference between a simple PCFG model and the best broad-coverage parsers available today.
Structural contexts like those captured by parent annotation (Johnson, 1998) are more subtle. $$$$$ It is well known that natural language exhibits dependencies that context-free grammars (CFGs) cannot describe (Culy 1985; Shieber 1985).

Grandparent annotation was used previously by Charniak and Carroll (1994) and Johnson (1998). $$$$$ A PCFG defines a probability distribution over the (finite) parse trees generated by the grammar, where the probability of a tree T is given by where Cr (A --> a) is the number of times the production A a is used in the derivation T. The PCFG that assigns maximum likelihood to the sequence i= of trees in a treebank corpus is given by the relative frequency estimator.
Grandparent annotation was used previously by Charniak and Carroll (1994) and Johnson (1998). $$$$$ The relative frequency estimator provides a straightforward way of inducing these grammars from treebank corpora, and a broad-coverage parsing system can be obtained by using a parser to find a maximum-likelihood parse tree for the input string with respect to such a treebank grammar.
Grandparent annotation was used previously by Charniak and Carroll (1994) and Johnson (1998). $$$$$ The kinds of tree representations used in a treebank corpus can have a dramatic effect on performance of a parser based on the PCFG estimated from that corpus, causing the estimated likelihood of a tree to differ substantially from its frequency in the training corpus.

See Johnson (1998) for a presentation of the transform/de transform paradigm in parsing. $$$$$ This performance variation comes about because any PCFG, and hence the corpus of trees from which the PCFG is induced, embodies independence assumptions about the distribution of words and phrases.
See Johnson (1998) for a presentation of the transform/de transform paradigm in parsing. $$$$$ Finally, note that the overgeneration of the PCFG model of the two-level adjunction structures is due to an independence assumption implicit in the PCFG model; specifically, that the upper and lower NPs in the two-level structure have the same expansions, and that these expansions have the same distributions.

See Johnson (1998) for a presentation of the transform/de transform paradigm in parsing. $$$$$ This paper studies the effects of these differing tree representations of PP modification theoretically by considering their effect on very simple corpora, and empirically by means of a tree transformation/detransformation methodology introduced below.

First, it captures both P and its parent P, which predicts the distribution over child symbols far better than just P (Johnson, 1998). $$$$$ Roughly speaking, the more nodes in the trees of the training corpus, the stronger the independence assumptions in the PCFG language model induced from those trees.

First, it captures both P and its parent P, which predicts the distribution over child symbols far better than just P (Johnson, 1998). $$$$$ In the work presented here the actual lexical items (words) are ignored, and the terminals of the trees are taken to be the part-of-speech (POS) tags assigned to the lexical items.

 $$$$$ Thus the location and labeling on the nonroot nonterminal nodes determine how a PCFG induced from a treebank generalizes from that training data.
 $$$$$ The x-axis shows the difference in number of productions in the PCFG after selective parent transform and the untransformed treebank PCFG, and the y-axis shows the difference in the average of the precision and recall scores. is usually influenced by considerations of parsimony; thus the Chomsky adjunction representation of PP modification may be preferred because it requires only a single context-free rule, rather than a rule schema abbreviating a potentially unbounded number of rules that would be required in flat tree representations of adjunction.
 $$$$$ This performance variation comes about because any PCFG, and hence the corpus of trees from which the PCFG is induced, embodies independence assumptions about the distribution of words and phrases.

These two requirements are related to grammar refinement by annotation (Johnson, 1998), where annotations must be bounded and monotonic. $$$$$ If these relationships are significant then a PCFG will be a poor language model.

Johnson (1998) annotates each node by its parent category in a tree, and gets significant improvements compared with the original PCFGs on the Penn Treebank. $$$$$ Of course, there is nothing particularly special about the particular tree transformations studied in this paper: other transforms could—and should—be studied in exactly the same manner.
Johnson (1998) annotates each node by its parent category in a tree, and gets significant improvements compared with the original PCFGs on the Penn Treebank. $$$$$ This is in fact to be expected, since the sequences consist of maximum-likelihood parses.

Parent Annotation Another common relabeling method in parsing is parent annotation (Johnson, 1998), in which a node is annotated with its parent's label. $$$$$ The particular independence assumptions implicit in a tree representation can be studied theoretically and investigated empirically by means of a tree transformation / detransformation process.

To deal with such problems ,weadopt a two-steps approach, the first being realized with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al 2001), the second with a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) (Johnson, 1998). $$$$$ For example, at f = 0.4812 = 0.36.

A PCFG model (Johnson, 1998) is used to parse complete entity trees upon components. $$$$$ What makes a tree representation a good choice for PCFG modeling seems to be quite different to what makes it a good choice for a representation of a linguistic theory.
A PCFG model (Johnson, 1998) is used to parse complete entity trees upon components. $$$$$ A PCFG is a CFG in which each production A -4 a in the grammar's set of productions P is associated with an emission probability P(A a) that satisfies a normalization constraint and a consistency or tightness constraint not discussed here, that PCFGs estimated from tree banks using the relative frequency estimator always satisfy (Chi and Geman 1998).
A PCFG model (Johnson, 1998) is used to parse complete entity trees upon components. $$$$$ Points labeled with a single category A correspond to PCFGs induced after applying the Parent transform to just those nodes labeled A, while points labeled with a pair of categories KB correspond to PCFGs induced applying the Parent transform to nodes labeled A with parents labeled B.
