One is the case in which a pronoun x correctly says that it is coreferent with another pronoun y. However, the program misidentifies the antecedent of y. In this case (sometimes called error chaining (Walker, 1989)), both x and y are to be scored as wrong, as they both end up in the wrong coreferential chain. $$$$$ Thus there are two parts to this paper: we present the quantitative results of hand-simulating these algorithms (henceforth Hobbs algorithm and BFP algorithm), but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performing such evaluations in general.

I use the following guidelines for the hand-simulated analysis (Walker, 1989). $$$$$ Hobbs algorithm gets the right antecedent for it in Exp3, which is the little handle, but then fails on it in Exp4, whereas the BFP algorithm has the pump centered at Expi and continues to select that as the antecedent for it throughout the text.

Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal oun phrases matches its syntactic features. $$$$$ IT was a forlorn hope.

 $$$$$ Other factors of interest are whether the dialogues are human-to-human or human-to-computer, as well as the modality of communication, e.g. spoken or typed, since some researchers have indicated that dialogues, and particularly uses of reference within them, vary along these dimensions [Coh84, Tho80, GSBC86, D389, WS89].
