One is the case in which a pronoun x correctly says that it is coreferent with another pronoun y. However, the program misidentifies the antecedent of y. In this case (sometimes called error chaining (Walker, 1989)), both x and y are to be scored as wrong, as they both end up in the wrong coreferential chain. $$$$$ We analyse the performance of the algorithms on three types of data.

In this case (sometimes called error chaining (Walker, 1989)), both x and y are to be scored as wrong, as they both end up in the wrong coreferential chain. $$$$$ We attempt to evaluate two different approaches to anaphoric processing in discourse by comparing the accuracy and coverage of two published algorithms for finding the co-specifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and dialogues.

In this case (sometimes called error chaining (Walker, 1989)), both x and y are to be scored as wrong, as they both end up in the wrong coreferential chain. $$$$$ The present concern is not with whether there might be a grammar of discourse that determines this structure, or whether it is derived from the cues that cooperative speakers give hearers to aid in processing.

I use the following guidelines for the hand-simulated analysis (Walker, 1989). $$$$$ We attempt to evaluate two different approaches to anaphoric processing in discourse by comparing the accuracy and coverage of two published algorithms for finding the co-specifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and dialogues.
I use the following guidelines for the hand-simulated analysis (Walker, 1989). $$$$$ Consider: Expi: Now we have a little red piece left Exp2: and I don't know what to do with IT.
I use the following guidelines for the hand-simulated analysis (Walker, 1989). $$$$$ In 59% to 82% of the cases both algorithms get the correct result.
I use the following guidelines for the hand-simulated analysis (Walker, 1989). $$$$$ The remaining sample is a set of 5 human-human, keyboard-mediated, task-oriented dialogues about the assembly of a plastic water pump [Coh84].

Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal oun phrases matches its syntactic features. $$$$$ The task-dialogues contain a total of 81 uses of it and no other pronouns except for I and you.
Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal oun phrases matches its syntactic features. $$$$$ I would like to thank Jerry Hobbs for encouraging me to do this in the first place.
Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal oun phrases matches its syntactic features. $$$$$ These are problems with: (a) allowing for underlying assumptions, (b) determining how to handle underspecifications, and (c) evaluating the contribution of false positives and error chaining.
Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal oun phrases matches its syntactic features. $$$$$ David Carter, Phil Cohen, Nick Haddock, Jerry Hobbs, Aravind Joshi, Don Knuth, Candy Sidner, Phil Stenton, Bonnie Webber, and Steve Whittaker have provided valuable insights toward this endeavor and critical comments on a multiplicity of earlier versions of this paper.

 $$$$$ There also are S-if-S cases, as in Mondale said: &quot;I think THE MAFIA would be broke if IT conducted all its business that way.&quot; We also have subject matching in AS-AS examples as in ... and the resulting EXPOSURE to daylight has become as uncomfortable as IT was unaccustomed, as well as in sentential complements, such as But another liberal, Minnesota's Walter MONDALE, said HE had found a lot of incompetence in the agency's operations.

 $$$$$ A housekeeper had brought a tray to HIS desk in the softly lighted study where, since 5 a.m., HE had been alternately reading memoranda (mostly on special blue stationery which Ford vice-presidents used in implementing policy) and dictating crisp instructions into a recording machine.
 $$$$$ However, the statistical analyses still show that there is no significant difference in the performance of the algorithms in general.
