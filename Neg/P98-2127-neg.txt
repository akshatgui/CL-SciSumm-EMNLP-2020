We will take advantage of the flexibility provided by our framework and use syntax based measure of similarity in the computation of the verb vectors, following (Lin, 1998). $$$$$ Ours is similar to (Grefenstette, 1994; Hindle, 1990; Ruge, 1992) in the use of dependency relationship as the word features, based on which word similarities are computed.

Chantree et al (2005) applied the distributional similarity proposed by Lin (1998) to coordination disambiguation. $$$$$ Suppose two thesaurus entries for the same word are as follows: For example, (5) is the entry for &quot;brief (noun)&quot; in our automatically generated thesaurus and (6) and (7) are corresponding entries in WordNet thesaurus and Roget thesaurus.
Chantree et al (2005) applied the distributional similarity proposed by Lin (1998) to coordination disambiguation. $$$$$ The difference between these two amounts is taken to be the information contained in 11w, r, w' II =câ€¢ An occurrence of a dependency triple (w, r, w') can be regarded as the co-occurrence of three events: A: a randomly selected word is w; B: a randomly selected dependency type is r; C: a randomly selected word is w1.
Chantree et al (2005) applied the distributional similarity proposed by Lin (1998) to coordination disambiguation. $$$$$ Evaluation of automatically generated lexical resources is a difficult problem.

Accurate measurement of semantic similarity between lexical units such as words or phrases is important for numerous tasks in natural language processing such as word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), synonym extraction (Lin, 1998a), and automatic thesauri generation (Curran, 2002). $$$$$ The commonality between two words consists of the dependency triples that appear in the descriptions of both words.

 $$$$$ For example, one of the 8 senses of &quot;company&quot; in WordNet 1.5 is a &quot;visitor/visitant&quot;, which is a hyponym of &quot;person&quot;.
 $$$$$ It has been argued that similarity plays an important role in word acquisition (Gentner, 1982).
 $$$$$ In (Dagan et al., 1993) and (Pereira et al., 1993), clusters of similar words are evaluated by how well they are able to recover data items that are removed from the input corpus one at a time.
 $$$$$ The similarity measure allows us to construct a thesaurus using a parsed corpus.

 $$$$$ Secondly, certain word usages may be particular to a period of time, which are unlikely to be captured by manually compiled lexicons.
 $$$$$ In this section, we present an evaluation of automatically constructed thesauri with two manually compiled thesauri, namely, WordNet1.5 (Miller et al., 1990) and Roget Thesaurus.

This seems to be a reasonable compromise between the approach of (Freitag et al, 2005), in which none normalization of words is done, and the more widespread use of syntactic parsers in work such as (Lin, 1998). $$$$$ For example, Figure 3 shows the similarity tree for the top-40 most similar words to duty.

For example, one of the 8 senses of company in WordNet is a visitor/visitant, which is a hyponym of person (Lin, 1998). $$$$$ When w, r, or w' is the wild card (*), the frequency counts of all the dependency triples that matches the rest of the pattern are summed up.
