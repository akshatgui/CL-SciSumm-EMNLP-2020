We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988). $$$$$ I was talking with Mary yesterday.

We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988). $$$$$ The two types are distinguished by whether they make reference to the interpretation of an antecedent—i.e., some object in a model of the world constructed by the interpreter of the sentence of discourse (deep anaphora)—or whether they are interpreted with respect to a previous logical form (surface anaphora).

 $$$$$ If Cb is interpreted as part of the current discourse segment, after its interpretation there are three possibilities: These relationships, which I will call maintenance and local movement of the TF, correspond to Sidner's DF moving gradually among the discourse entities in a discourse segment.
 $$$$$ (Whether this is further interpreted as two simultaneous events or a single event of their playing a duet depends on context and, perhaps, world knowledge as well.)
 $$$$$ This not only allows us to capture in a simple way the oft-stated but difficult-to-prove intuition that tense is anaphoric, but also contributes to our knowledge of what is needed for understanding narrative text.

 $$$$$ Thus given pconseq(Cb,Ea,RTb) = Eb, event Eb is taken as being part of the consequent phase of Ea.
 $$$$$ In this paper, I have presented a uniform characterization of discourse anaphora in a way that includes definite pronouns, definite NPs, and tensed clauses.

 $$$$$ The particular entity specified depends on another entity in that part of the evolving &quot;discourse model&quot; that the listener is currently attending to. expressions have been called show how tensed clauses share these characteristics, usually just attributed to anaphoric noun phrases.
 $$$$$ Over the discourse segment, other discourse entities in the segment's focus space may in turn become DF.
 $$$$$ Recall that I presume that a listener's developing discourse model represents both the entities being discussed, along with their properties and relations, and the events and situations being discussed, along with their relationships with another.
 $$$$$ *He broke his ankle, walking on a patch of ice.

However, previous research has found that demonstrative anaphors rarely refer to NPs, while it rarely refers to discourse segments (Webber (1988a)). $$$$$ They specify entities in an evolving model of the discourse that the listener is constructing; 2.
However, previous research has found that demonstrative anaphors rarely refer to NPs, while it rarely refers to discourse segments (Webber (1988a)). $$$$$ However, I will argue that some indefinite NPs should also be considered discourse anaphors in just this same way.
However, previous research has found that demonstrative anaphors rarely refer to NPs, while it rarely refers to discourse segments (Webber (1988a)). $$$$$ I will review previous attempts to make the notion precise, attempts that require special-purpose machinery to get them to work.

 $$$$$ In doing so, I have argued that the successful use of discourse anaphors depends on two different things: 1. speakers' and listeners' (mutual) beliefs about the ontology of the things and events being discussed, and 2. speakers' and listeners' (mutual) focus of attention.

Webber (Webber, 1988) improved upon the above work by specifying rules for how events are related to one another in a discourse and Sing and Sing defined semantic constraints through which events can be related (Sing, 1997). $$$$$ This work was partially supported by ARO grant DAA29-884-9-0027, NSF grant MCS-8219116-CER, and DARPA grant N00014-85-K-0018 to the University of Pennsylvania, by DARPA grant N00014-85-C-0012 to UNISYS Paoli Research Center, and an Alvey grant to the Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh.

Webber (Webber, 1988) improved upon the above work by specifying rules for how events are related to one another in a discourse and Sing and Sing defined semantic constraints through which events can be related (Sing, 1997). $$$$$ However, she subsequently recognized that taking simple past tense as directly analogous with pronouns was incompatible with the usual forward movement of time in the interpretation in a sequence of sentences denoting events (Partee 1984).

Consider discourse (1), from (Webber 1988). $$$$$ Then I will show, in contrast, that the notion can more simply be made precise in terms of a set of similar anaphoric functions that again depend on ontology and discourse structure.

 $$$$$ She told me about her trip to Alaska.
 $$$$$ In terms of the constraints I mentioned above, it is only those discourse entities that are either the DF or on the PFL that can serve as Ea for an anaphoric definite NP.9 In Sidner (1983) DFs always are stacked for possible resumption later.
 $$$$$ The former implicates semantics in the explanation of discourse anaphora, the latter, discourse itself.
 $$$$$ Such expressions have been called anaphors.
