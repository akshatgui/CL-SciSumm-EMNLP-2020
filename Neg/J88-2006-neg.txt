We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988). $$$$$ To handle this, I again assume that TF behaves much like Sidner's DF in response to the listener's recognition of the end of an embedded narrative: that is, the cached TF is resumed and processing continues.21 Under this assumption, Clauses 17a–c are interpreted as in the previous example (cf.
We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988). $$$$$ While their deep anaphors include pronouns, Hankamer and Sag do not consider other expressions like NPs in discourse that might also be described in similar model-interpretive terms, nor do they describe in any detail how model interpretation works for the expressions they consider.

 $$$$$ In Grosz and Sidner (1986) it is an entire focus space (FS) (Grosz 1977) that gets stacked (i.e., the collection of entities L is attending to by virtue of the current discourse segment (DS)) but only when the 9purpose of the current DS is taken to dominate that of the one upcoming.

 $$$$$ Example 20 above illustrates one case of an anaphoric function on an NP and a tensed clause, specifically B(Cb,E„,RTb) where the entity Ea has been evoked by an NP rather than a clause.

However, previous research has found that demonstrative anaphors rarely refer to NPs, while it rarely refers to discourse segments (Webber (1988a)). $$$$$ In doing so, I have argued that the successful use of discourse anaphors depends on two different things: 1. speakers' and listeners' (mutual) beliefs about the ontology of the things and events being discussed, and 2. speakers' and listeners' (mutual) focus of attention.
However, previous research has found that demonstrative anaphors rarely refer to NPs, while it rarely refers to discourse segments (Webber (1988a)). $$$$$ To avoid confusion then, I will use the term discourse anaphors for expressions that have these two properties.'

 $$$$$ The two types are distinguished by whether they make reference to the interpretation of an antecedent—i.e., some object in a model of the world constructed by the interpreter of the sentence of discourse (deep anaphora)—or whether they are interpreted with respect to a previous logical form (surface anaphora).
