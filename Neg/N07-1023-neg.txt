Modifications of this model are reported in Turner and Charniak (2005) and Galley and McKeown (2007) with improved results. $$$$$ Since we found that exploiting sentence pairs containing insertions had adverse consequences in terms of compression accuracies, we only report experiments with sentence pairs containing no insertions.
Modifications of this model are reported in Turner and Charniak (2005) and Galley and McKeown (2007) with improved results. $$$$$ One successful syntax-driven approach (Knight and Marcu, 2000, henceforth K&M) relies on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) (Lewis and Stearns, 1968; Aho and Ullman, 1969).

(Galley and McKeown, 2007) extended the noisy-channel approach and proposed a head-driven Markovization formulation of synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) deletion rules. $$$$$ Since McDonald’s approach does not incorporate SCFG deletion rules, and conditions deletions on less lexico-syntactic context, we believe this will lead to levels of performance superior to both papers.
(Galley and McKeown, 2007) extended the noisy-channel approach and proposed a head-driven Markovization formulation of synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) deletion rules. $$$$$ Finally, we used the same test data as K&M for human evaluation purposes (32 sentence pairs).
(Galley and McKeown, 2007) extended the noisy-channel approach and proposed a head-driven Markovization formulation of synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) deletion rules. $$$$$ Different smoothing techniques were evaluated with our models, and we found that interpolated Witten-Bell discounting was the method that performed best.

The last sentence compression method we use is the lexicalized Markov grammar-based approach (Galley and McKeown, 2007) with edit word detection (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Donald’s features include compression bigrams, as well as soft syntactic evidence extracted from parse trees and dependency trees.
The last sentence compression method we use is the lexicalized Markov grammar-based approach (Galley and McKeown, 2007) with edit word detection (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Some important distinctions, such as between arguments and adjuncts, are beyond the scope of the PTB annotation, and it is often difficult to determine out of context whether a given constituent can safely be deleted from a righthand side.
The last sentence compression method we use is the lexicalized Markov grammar-based approach (Galley and McKeown, 2007) with edit word detection (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ To acquire SCFG productions, we used Ziff-Davis, a corpus of technical articles and human abstractive summaries.

 $$$$$ The utilities will be bundled with Quickdex II.
 $$$$$ Note that lexical conditioning also helps in the case where the training data is relatively small (ZD-0), though differences are less significant, and bilexical dependencies actually hurt performance.
 $$$$$ Glare protection is effective.

Where the tree pairs are isomorphic, synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) may suffice, but in general, non-isomorphism can make the problem of rule extraction difficult (Galley and McKeown,2007). $$$$$ In the case of sentence compression, we restrict the target side to be a sub-sequence of the source side (possibly identical), and we will call this restricted grammar a deletion SCFG.
Where the tree pairs are isomorphic, synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) may suffice, but in general, non-isomorphism can make the problem of rule extraction difficult (Galley and McKeown,2007). $$$$$ Finally, we evaluate different Markovized models, and find that our selected best model is one that exploits head-modifier bilexicalization to accurately distinguish adjuncts from complements, and that produces sentences that were judged more grammatical than those generated by previous work.

Galley and McKeown (2007) show improvements to the noisy-channel approach based on rule lexicalization and rule Markovization. $$$$$ We also use a robust approach for tree-to-tree alignment between arbitrary document-abstract parallel corpora, which lets us train lexicalized models with much more data than previous approaches relying exclusively on scarcely available document-compression corpora.
Galley and McKeown (2007) show improvements to the noisy-channel approach based on rule lexicalization and rule Markovization. $$$$$ As in standard PCFG history-based models, the probability of the entire structure (Equation 2) is factored into probabilities of grammar productions.

We use the sentence pairs available in the Ziff-Davis Tree Alignment corpus (Galley and McKeown, 2007). $$$$$ This Markovization enabled us to incorporate lexical conditioning variables into our models.
We use the sentence pairs available in the Ziff-Davis Tree Alignment corpus (Galley and McKeown, 2007). $$$$$ Indeed, our base training corpus described in Section 4 contains only 951 SCFG productions, 593 appearing once.

We use the sentence pairs available in the Ziff-Davis Tree Alignment corpus (Galley and McKeown, 2007). $$$$$ We also exploited more general tree productions known as synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) rules, in an approach quite similar to (Turner and Charniak, 2005).

Rather than attempt to derive a new parse tree like Knight and Marcu (2000) and Galley and McKeown (2007), we learn to safely remove a set of constituents in our parse tree-based compression model while preserving grammatical structure and essential content. $$$$$ Human Many debugging features, including user-defined points and variable-watching and message-watching windows, have been added.
Rather than attempt to derive a new parse tree like Knight and Marcu (2000) and Galley and McKeown (2007), we learn to safely remove a set of constituents in our parse tree-based compression model while preserving grammatical structure and essential content. $$$$$ Clearly, the two trees may sometimes be structurally quite different (e.g., a given PP may attach to an NP in 7rf, while attaching to VP in 7rc), and it is not always possible to build an SCFG derivation given the constraints in (7rf, 7rc).
