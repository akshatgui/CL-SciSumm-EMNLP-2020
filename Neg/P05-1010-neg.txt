Matsuzaki et al (2005) independently introduce a similar approach and present empirical results that rival ours. $$$$$ Utsuro et al.

 $$$$$ The relationships between the average parse time and parsing performance using the three parsing methods described in Section 3 are shown in Figure 8.
 $$$$$ The other two methods are a little more complicated, and we explain them in separate subsections.

These scores are the same as the variational rule scores of Matsuzaki et al (2005). $$$$$ One of the three methods gives a performance of 86.6% (F, sentences 40 words) on the standard test set of the Penn WSJ corpus.

 $$$$$ We do not assume any structured parametrizations in and ; that is, each and is itself a parameter to be tuned.
 $$$$$ In those parsers, the strong conditional independence assumption made in vanilla treebank PCFGs is weakened by annotating non-terminal symbols with many ‘features’ (Goodman, 1997; Johnson, 1998).
 $$$$$ The superiority of the third method over the first method seems to stem from the difference in the number of candidate parses from which the outputs are selected.5 The superiority of the third method over the second method is a natural consequence of the consistent use of both in the estimation (as the objective function) and in the parsing (as the score of a parse).
