Alm et al (2005) and Francisco and Gervas (2006) worked on fairy tales. $$$$$ We also discuss results for a tripartite model which covers emotional valence, as well as feature set alernations.
Alm et al (2005) and Francisco and Gervas (2006) worked on fairy tales. $$$$$ If sequenc ing seemed important, an automatic method using sequential target activation could be added next.
Alm et al (2005) and Francisco and Gervas (2006) worked on fairy tales. $$$$$ This paper has discussed an empirical study of thetext-based emotion prediction problem in the domain of children?s fairy tales, with child-directed ex pressive text-to-speech synthesis as goal.
Alm et al (2005) and Francisco and Gervas (2006) worked on fairy tales. $$$$$ More detailed averaged results from 10-fold cross-validation are included in table 6 using all features and the separated tuning and evaluationdata condition sep-tune-eval.

They later use this corpus to construct a reasonably accurate classifier for emotional states of sentences (Alm et al., 2005). $$$$$ Text does not only communicate informative con tents, but also attitudinal information, includingemotional states.

The second is the frequency with which the character is associated with emotional language - their emotional trajectory (Alm et al 2005). $$$$$ The goal is to classify the emotional affinity of sentences in the narra tive domain of children?s fairy tales, forsubsequent usage in appropriate expressive rendering of text-to-speech synthe sis.
The second is the frequency with which the character is associated with emotional language - their emotional trajectory (Alm et al 2005). $$$$$ In speech, speakers effectively express emotions by modifying prosody, including pitch, intensity, and durational cues in the speech signal.
The second is the frequency with which the character is associated with emotional language - their emotional trajectory (Alm et al 2005). $$$$$ The following reports on an em pirical study of text-based emotion prediction.
The second is the frequency with which the character is associated with emotional language - their emotional trajectory (Alm et al 2005). $$$$$ Thus, inorder to make text-to-speech synthesis sound as natural and engaging as possible, it is important to con vey the emotional stance in the text.

These tools and resources have been already used in a large number of applications, including expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al, 2005), tracking sentiment timelines in on line forums and news (Balog et al, 2006), analysis of political debates (Carvalho et al, 2011), question answering (Oh et al., 2012), conversation summarization (Carenini et al., 2008), and citation sentiment detection (Athar and Teufel, 2012). $$$$$ Sequential modeling of simple classifiers has been successfully employed to question classification, for example by (Li and Roth, 2002).
