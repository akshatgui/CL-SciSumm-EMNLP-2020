 $$$$$ We conclude that the uniformity of the syntactic constructions found in the sentences used in the above test sequence does not influence the results.
 $$$$$ Typically, natural language generation is divided into several phases, namely text planning (determining output content and structure), sentence planning (determining abstract target language resources to express content, such as lexical items and syntactic constructions), and realization (producing the final text string) (Reiter, 1994).

Realization is achieved with the RealPro surface realizer (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ This has the advantage that the sentence planner can be unabashedly domain-specific, which is necessary in today's applications, since a broad-coverage implementation of a domain-independent theory of conceptual representations and their mapping to linguistic representations is still far from being realistic.
