 $$$$$ We then describe a particular method for parameter estimation, which is a generalization of the perceptron algorithm.
 $$$$$ As before, define yi to be the gold standard parse for the i’th sentence, and also define yji to be the partial analysis under the gold-standard parse for the first j words of the i’th sentence.
 $$$$$ This paper describes an incremental parsing approach where parameters are estimated using a variant of the perceptron algorithm.

 $$$$$ For example, in figure 2 the chain (S† , S , NP , NN , Trash) is used to construct an analysis for the first word alone.
 $$$$$ As a practical matter, the set of leftchild chains for a terminal x is taken to be the union of the sets of left-child chains for all pre-terminal part-ofspeech (POS) tags T for x.
 $$$$$ The next section describes our instantiation of these choices.
 $$$$$ A beam-search algorithm is used during both training and decoding phases of the method.

We used an early update version of averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins and Roark, 2004) for training of shift-reduce and top-down parsers. $$$$$ To this end, a number of recently proposed methods allow a model to incorporate “arbitrary” global features of candidate analyses or parses.
