It is possible to prove that, provided the training set (xi ,zi) is separable with margin $$$$$ To concisely present the baseline feature set, let us establish a notation.
It is possible to prove that, provided the training set (xi ,zi) is separable with margin $$$$$ The grammar G = (V, T, S†, ¯S, C, B) consists of a set of non-terminal symbols V , a set of terminal symbols T, a start symbol S† E V , an end-ofconstituent symbol S¯ E V , a set of “allowable chains” C, and a set of “allowable triples” B. S¯ is a special empty non-terminal that marks the end of a constituent.
