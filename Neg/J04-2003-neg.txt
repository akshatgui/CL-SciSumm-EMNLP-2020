In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ This is especially the case for more-inflecting major languages like German.
In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ As monolingual data are much easier and cheaper to compile, this corpus might be (substantially) larger than the target language part of C2.
In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ It is important to note here that C1 and C2 can, but need not, be distinct, and that the monolingual corpus can be identical to the target language part of C2.
In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ Section 4 is dedicated to hierarchical lexicon models.

There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004). $$$$$ A word alignment between the sentences in C1 is trained with some automatic alignment algorithm.
There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004). $$$$$ In statistical machine translation, every target language string eI1 = e1 · · · eI is assigned a probability Pr(eI1) of being a valid word sequence in the target language and a probability Pr(eI1|f J1) of being a translation for the given source language string f1J = f1 · · · fJ.

Niessen and Ney (2004) used morphological decomposition to get better alignments. $$$$$ The resulting multiword phrases Pe for the target language and Pf for the source language are afterwards concatenated within D to form entries consisting of pairs of “units.” The next step is to analyze the word forms in D and generate all possible readings of all entries.

 $$$$$ In many languages, the sentence structure of questions differs from the structure in declarative sentences in that the order of the subject and the corresponding finite verb is inverted.

 $$$$$ The comparative more convenient would be the completely correct translation.
 $$$$$ Although the IBM group finally made use of morphological and syntactic information to enhance translation quality (Brown et al. 1992; Berger et al.

 $$$$$ Using the tag sequence translation probabilities p(tf|te), the readings in one language are aligned with readings in the other language.
 $$$$$ C2, D', and A are presented as input to the maximum-entropy training of a hierarchical lexicon model as described in Section 4.2.
 $$$$$ Sparse bilingual training data also make additional conventional dictionaries especially important.
 $$$$$ In this situation many of the inflected word forms to account for in test do not occur during training.

Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ This work has been partially supported as part of the Verbmobil project (contract number 01 IV 701 T4) by the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology and as part of the EuTrans project (project number 30268) by the European Union.
Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ Features from those hierarchy levels are combined to form hierarchical lexicon models, which can replace the standard probabilistic lexicon used in most statistical machine translation systems.
Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ German prefix verbs consist of a main part and a detachable prefix, which can be shifted to the end of the clause.
Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ Some recent publications deal with the automatic detection of multiword phrases (Och and Weber 1998; Tillmann and Ney 2000).

Niessen and Ney (2004) have used morphological decomposition to improve alignment quality. $$$$$ The hierarchy of equivalence classes F0, ... ,Fn is as follows: where n is the maximum number of morpho-syntactic tags.

Niessen and Ney (2004) have used morphological decomposition to improve alignment quality. $$$$$ For this purpose, the lexicon should contain base forms of words and the grammatical category, subcategorization features, and semantic information in order to enable the size of the lexicon to be reduced and in order to account for unknown word forms, that is, word forms not present explicitly in the dictionary.
Niessen and Ney (2004) have used morphological decomposition to improve alignment quality. $$$$$ It is thus promising to “harmonize” the word order in corresponding sentences.

For the second kind, Niessen and Ney (2004) used morpho-syntactic information for translation between language pairs with scarce resources. $$$$$ The word forms in C1 need not match those in D. C1 is not necessarily the training corpus for the translation task in which the disambiguated version of D will be used.

Among these were cases that can be handled such as separable prefix verbs like 'aufzeigten' ('pointed out') (Niessen and Ney, 2000) or adjective compounds such as 'multidimensionale' ('multi dimensional'). $$$$$ The bilingual training data can be better exploited by explicitly taking into account the interdependencies of related inflected forms.
