In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ The underlying (probabilistic) lexicon contains only pairs of full forms.
In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ 1996), most of today’s statistical machine translation systems still consider only surface forms and use no linguistic knowledge about the structure of the languages involved.

In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ The benefit from these combined models is twofold: First, the lexical coverage is improved, because the translation of unseen word forms can be derived by considering information from lower levels in the hierarchy.

There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004). $$$$$ 1990; Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer 1993) are commonly referred to as IBM models 1–5, based on the numbering in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993).
There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004). $$$$$ Second, category ambiguity can be resolved, because syntactical context information is made locally accessible by means of annotation with morpho-syntactic tags.

Niessen and Ney (2004) used morphological decomposition to get better alignments. $$$$$ Maltese and Mancini (1992) report that a linear interpolation of word n-grams, part of speech n-grams, and lemma n-grams yields lower perplexity than pure word-based models.

 $$$$$ This can be useful for choosing the correct translation of ambiguous words.
 $$$$$ In modeling for statistical machine translation, a hidden variable aJ1, denoting the hidden alignment between the words in the source and target languages, is usually introduced into the string translation probability: In the following, Tj = �tn � j denotes the lemma-tag representation of the jth word in 0 the input sentence.
 $$$$$ To summarize, the lemma-tag representation of a corpus has the following main advantages: It makes context information locally available, and it allows information to be explicitly accessed at different levels of abstraction.

Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ Section 6 provides an overview of our procedure for training model parameters for statistical machine translation with scarce resources.
Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ In equation (5), the notation tn0 is used again for the lemma-tag representation of an input word (this was denoted by T in equations (2)–(4) for notational simplicity): where Λ = {Am} is the set of model parameters with one weight Am for each feature function hm.
Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ For the automatic alignment process, it is often difficult to associate one English word with more than one word in the corresponding German sentence, namely, the main part of the verb and the separated prefix.
Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ The additional information results from complex reasoning, and it is not directly accessible from the full-wordform representation in the data.

For the second kind, Niessen and Ney (2004) used morpho-syntactic information for translation between language pairs with scarce resources. $$$$$ For example, from the context in the sentence Ich werde die Zimmer buchen, it is possible to infer that Zimmer in this sentence is plural and has to be translated by rooms in English, whereas the correct translation of Zimmer in the sentence Ich h¨atte gerne ein Zimmer is the singular form room.

(Niessen and Ney, 2004) describe a method that combines morphologically split verbs in German, and also reorders questions in English and German. $$$$$ In statistical machine translation, correspondences between the words in the source and the target language are learned from parallel corpora, and often little or no linguistic knowledge is used to structure the underlying models.

Among these were cases that can be handled such as separable prefix verbs like 'aufzeigten' ('pointed out') (Niessen and Ney, 2000) or adjective compounds such as 'multidimensionale' ('multi dimensional'). $$$$$ Section 3 suggests solutions for two specific aspects of structural difference, namely, question inversion and separated verb prefixes.
