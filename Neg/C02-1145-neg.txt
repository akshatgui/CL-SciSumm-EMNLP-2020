 $$$$$ In both the segmentation/POS tagging phase and the syntactic bracketing phase, understanding the structure of the sentences is essential for correct annotation with reasonable speed.

It is also binary feature and all the punctuations in the punctuation character list come from Penn Chinese Tree bank 5.1 (N.Xue et al,2002). $$$$$ Specifically, we attempt to answer four questions: (i) how do we speed up the annotation process, (ii) how do we maintain high quality, i.e. annotation accuracy and inter-annotator consistency during the annotation process, and (iii) for what purposes is the corpus applicable, and (iv) what are our future plans?
