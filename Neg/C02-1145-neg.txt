 $$$$$ The Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) is an ongoing project, with its objective being to create a segmented Chinese corpus annotated with POS tags and syntactic brackets.
 $$$$$ In this paper we address issues related to building a large-scale Chinese corpus.

 $$$$$ We try to answer four questions: (i) how to speed up annotation, (ii) how to maintain high annotation quality, (iii) for what purposes is the corpus applicable, and finally (iv) what future work we anticipate.

 $$$$$ Currently the second installment of the project, the 400,000-word CTB-II is being developed and is expected to be completed early in the year 2003.

It is also binary feature and all the punctuations in the punctuation character list come from Penn Chinese Tree bank 5.1 (N.Xue et al,2002). $$$$$ background, guideline design and more importantly, the availability of preprocessing tools.

At last, all the punctuations in Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1 (N.Xue et al,2002). $$$$$ CTB-II will follow the standards set up in the segmentation (Xia 2000b), POS tagging (Xia 2000a) and bracketing guidelines (Xue and Xia 2000) and it will use articles from Peoples' Daily, Hong Kong newswire and material translated into Chinese from other languages in addition to the Xinhua newswire used in CTB-I in an effort to diversify the sources.

reported accuracies of 93% and 93.74% on CTB-I (Xue et al, 2002) (100K words) and CTB 5.0 (500K words), respectively, each using a Maximum Entropy approach. $$$$$ Specifically, we attempt to answer four questions: (i) how do we speed up the annotation process, (ii) how do we maintain high quality, i.e. annotation accuracy and inter-annotator consistency during the annotation process, and (iii) for what purposes is the corpus applicable, and (iv) what are our future plans?

Furthermore, to evaluate our reranking method's impact on the POS tagging task, we also performed 10-fold cross-validation tests on the 250k Penn 205Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al, 2002). $$$$$ Specifically, we attempt to answer four questions: (i) how do we speed up the annotation process, (ii) how do we maintain high quality, i.e. annotation accuracy and inter-annotator consistency during the annotation process, and (iii) for what purposes is the corpus applicable, and (iv) what are our future plans?

In the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et al, 2002) non-local dependencies are represented in terms of empty categories (ECs) and (for some of them) co indexation with antecedents, as exemplified in Figure 1. $$$$$ In this paper, we will address three issues in the development of the Chinese Treebank: annotation speed, annotation accuracy and usability of the corpus.

After analyzing the dependency structure of sentences in Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1 (Xue et al, 2002), we found an interesting phenomenon: if we define a main-root as the head of a sentence, and define a subsentence as a sequence of words separated by punctuations, and the head1 of these words is the child of main root or main-root itself, then the punctuations that depend on main-root can be a separator of sub-sentences. $$$$$ We try to answer four questions: (i) how to speed up annotation, (ii) how to maintain high annotation quality, (iii) for what purposes is the corpus applicable, and finally (iv) what future work we anticipate.
