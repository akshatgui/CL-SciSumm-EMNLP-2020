Class based methods (Pereira et al 1993) approximate the likelihood of unobserved words based on similar words. $$$$$ We use for this purpose the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between two distributions This is a natural choice for a variety of reasons, which we will just sketch here.'

 $$$$$ The resulting training set was used to build a sequence of cluster models as before.
 $$$$$ While the clusters derived by the proposed method seem in many cases semantically significant, this intuition needs to be grounded in a more rigorous assessment.
 $$$$$ In other words, the exceptional cases are those in which predictions based just on the marginal frequencies, which the initial one-cluster model represents, would be consistently wrong.

Distributional clustering of words was first proposed by Pereira Tishby and Leein (Pereira et al, 1993): They cluster nouns according to their conditional verb distributions. $$$$$ We describe and evaluate experimentally a method for clustering words according to their distribution in particular syntactic contexts.

The cluster output can then be used as classes for selectional preferences (Pereira et al, 1993), or one can directly use frequency information from distributionally similar words for smoothing (Grishman and Sterling, 1994). $$$$$ In general, we are interested in how to organize a set of linguistic objects such as words according to the contexts in which they occur, for instance grammatical constructions or n-grams.

This indicates that techniques for differentiating between different senses are needed e.g., using a soft clustering technique as in (Pereira et al 1993) instead of a hard clustering technique. $$$$$ As a first experiment, we used our method to classify the 64 nouns appearing most frequently as heads of direct objects of the verb &quot;fire&quot; in one year (1988) of Associated Press newswire.

Of course, this is one of many different possible similarity measures which could have been used (Pereira et al (1993)), including ones that do not depend on additional labels. $$$$$ In this corpus, the chosen nouns appear as direct object heads of a total of 2147 distinct verbs, so each noun is represented by a density over the 2147 verbs.

In particular, a cluster learning algorithm that permits clusters to split and/or merge, as in Petrov et al (2006) or in Pereira et al (1993), may be appropriate. $$$$$ We have demonstrated that a general divisive clustering procedure for probability distributions can be used to group words according to their participation in particular grammatical relations with other words.
In particular, a cluster learning algorithm that permits clusters to split and/or merge, as in Petrov et al (2006) or in Pereira et al (1993), may be appropriate. $$$$$ In particular, we would like to find a set of clusters C such that each conditional distribution p0(v) can be approximately decomposed as where p(c1n) is the membership probability of n in c and pc(v) = p(vIc) is v's conditional probability given by the centroid distribution for cluster c. The above decomposition can be written in a more symmetric form as assuming that p(n) and P(n) coincide.
In particular, a cluster learning algorithm that permits clusters to split and/or merge, as in Petrov et al (2006) or in Pereira et al (1993), may be appropriate. $$$$$ That split is somewhat less sharp, possibly because not enough distinguishing contexts occur in the corpus.

While previous cognitively-motivated computational frameworks required structured input (e.g. Falkenhainer et al, 1989), the CP method adapts distributional clustering (Pereira et al, 1993), a standard approach applicable to unstructured data. $$$$$ The task consists judging which of two verbs v and v' is more likely to take a given noun n as object, when all occurrences of (v, n) in the training set were deliberately deleted.

There are a few exceptions to this tradition, such as Pereira et al (1993), Rooth et al (1999), Korhonen et al (2003), who used soft clustering methods for multiple assignment to verb semantic classes. $$$$$ Ideally, there is just one split at that critical value, but for practical performance and numerical accuracy reasons we may have several splits at the new critical point.

Lexical relatedness between terms could be derived either from a thesaurus like WordNet or from raw monolingual corpora via distributional similarity (Pereira et al, 1993). $$$$$ As a first experiment, we used our method to classify the 64 nouns appearing most frequently as heads of direct objects of the verb &quot;fire&quot; in one year (1988) of Associated Press newswire.

Lexical relatedness between terms could be derived either from a thesaurus like WordNet or from raw monolingual corpora via distributional similarity (Pereira et al, 1993). $$$$$ It can be seen that first split separates the objects corresponding to the weaponry sense of &quot;fire&quot; (cluster 1) from the ones corresponding to the personnel action (cluster 2).

Our approach differs from standard word clustering in that the clustering criteria is directly linked to the re ranking objective, whereas previous word clustering approaches (e.g. Brown et al (1992) or Pereira et al (1993)) have typically leveraged distributional similarity. $$$$$ From the practical point of view, word classification addresses questions of data sparseness and generalization in statistical language models, particularly models for deciding among alternative analyses proposed by a grammar.

For example, Pereira et al (1993) begin with a co occurrence matrix and transform this matrix into a clustering. $$$$$ The analogy with statistical mechanics suggests a deterministic annealing procedure for clustering (Rose et al., 1990), in which the number of clusters is determined through a sequence of phase transitions by continuously increasing the parameter 0 following an annealing schedule.

In a similar vein, our model is both similar and distinct in comparison to the soft clustering approaches by Pereira et al (1993) and Korhonenetal. $$$$$ We can now see that the variation 6 log Z, vanishes for centroid distributions given by (11), since it follows from (10) that The Free Energy Function The combined minimum distortion and maximum entropy optimization is equivalent to the minimization of a single function, the free energy where (D) is the average distortion (5) and H is the cluster membership entropy (6).
In a similar vein, our model is both similar and distinct in comparison to the soft clustering approaches by Pereira et al (1993) and Korhonenetal. $$$$$ We will consider here only the problem of classifying nouns according to their distribution as direct objects of verbs; the converse problem is formally similar.
In a similar vein, our model is both similar and distinct in comparison to the soft clustering approaches by Pereira et al (1993) and Korhonenetal. $$$$$ More recently, we have constructed similar tables with the help of a statistical part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988) and of tools for regular expression pattern matching on tagged corpora (Yarowsky, 1992).

Pereira et al (1993) suggested deterministic annealing to cluster verb-argument pairs into classes of verbs and nouns. $$$$$ This joint optimization searches for a saddle point in the distortion-entropy parameters, which is equivalent to minimizing a linear combination of the two known as free energy in statistical mechanics.

 $$$$$ Our problem can be seen as that of learning a joint distribution of pairs from a large sample of pairs.
 $$$$$ Instead, the only information about the objects is the statistics of their joint appearance.
 $$$$$ Since no other information is available, the membership is determined by maximizing the configuration entropy for a fixed average distortion.

Pereira et al (1993) used clustering to build an unlabeled hierarchy of nouns. $$$$$ So, far, we have looked at two kinds of measurements of model quality: (i) relative entropy between held-out data and the asymmetric model, and (ii) performance on the task of deciding which of two verbs is more likely to take a given noun as direct object when the data relating one of the verbs to the noun has been withheld from the training data.
