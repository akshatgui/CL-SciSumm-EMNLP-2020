Using a statistical model called prediction by partial matching (PPM), Teahan et al (2000) reported a significantly better result. $$$$$ For example, one study concludes that the performance of an unsegmented characterbased query is about 10% worse than that of the corresponding segmented query (Broglio, Callan, and Croft 1996).
Using a statistical model called prediction by partial matching (PPM), Teahan et al (2000) reported a significantly better result. $$$$$ Quotation marks also differ: L 1 in Rocling but &quot; &quot; in PH.
Using a statistical model called prediction by partial matching (PPM), Teahan et al (2000) reported a significantly better result. $$$$$ L-4 For example, the word 1---1 El (&quot;to go abroad&quot;) is an infrequent word that appears only twenty times in the PH corpus.

Teahan (Teahan et al, 2000) has successfully applied escape method D to segment Chinese text. $$$$$ However, it has been argued that considering the inherent uncertainty in Chinese word segmentation, generalpurpose segmentation algorithms should segment aggressively rather than conservatively (Wu 1998); consequently this corpus seems appropriate for our use.
Teahan (Teahan et al, 2000) has successfully applied escape method D to segment Chinese text. $$$$$ In fact III is the second most frequent character in the corpus, appearing in 443 separate words.
Teahan (Teahan et al, 2000) has successfully applied escape method D to segment Chinese text. $$$$$ Existing techniques are either linguistically based, using a dictionary of words, or rely on hand-crafted segmentation rules, or use adaptive models that have been specifically created for the purpose of Chinese word segmentation.
Teahan (Teahan et al, 2000) has successfully applied escape method D to segment Chinese text. $$$$$ Although a text may be thought of as a corresponding sequence of words, there is considerable ambiguity in the placement of boundaries.

Treating each character individually as in (Teahan et al, 2000) requires a large amount of training data in order to calculate all the probabilities in the tables, as well as a large amount of table space and time to lookup data from the tables. $$$$$ We also used the F-measure to compare our results with others: If the automatic method produces the same number of words as the hand-segmentation, recall and precision both become equal to one minus the error rate.
Treating each character individually as in (Teahan et al, 2000) requires a large amount of training data in order to calculate all the probabilities in the tables, as well as a large amount of table space and time to lookup data from the tables. $$$$$ Our results compare very favorably with the results of Hockenmaier and Brew (1998) on the PH corpus; unfortunately no other researchers have published quantitative results on a standard corpus.

Machine learning approaches are more desirable and have been successful in both unsupervised learning (Peng and Schuur mans, 2001) and supervised learning (Teahan et al, 2000). $$$$$ For example, the last word in K. is counted as correct even though in the corpus it is written *.

Machine learning approaches are more desirable and have been successful in both unsupervised learning (Peng and Schuur mans, 2001) and supervised learning (Teahan et al, 2000). $$$$$ It is trained on a corpus of presegmented text, and when applied to new text, interpolates word boundaries so as to maximize the compression obtained.

For example, the N-gram generative language modeling based approach of Teahan et al (2000) does not use domain knowledge. $$$$$ The only remaining question is how to calculate the probabilities from the counts— a simple matter once we have resolved how much space to allocate for the escape probability.

In addition, compared to simple models like n-gram language models (Teahan et al, 2000), another shortcoming of CRF-based segmenters is that it requires significantly longer training time. $$$$$ We have developed an alternative based on a general-purpose character-level model of text—the kind of models used in the very best text compression schemes.

This approach reduces to the cross-entropy/compression-based approach of (Teahan et al 2000). $$$$$ Readers unfamiliar with Chinese can gain an appreciation of the problem of multiple interpretations from Figure 1, which shows two alternative interpretations of the same Chinese character sequence.

This approach reduces to the cross-entropy/compression-based approach of (Teahan et al 2000). $$$$$ An alternative is to work backwards through the text, resulting in the maximum backward match heuristic.
This approach reduces to the cross-entropy/compression-based approach of (Teahan et al 2000). $$$$$ Full-text indexing was developed using languages where word boundaries are notated (principally English), and the techniques that were developed rely on wordbased processing.

Second, the probabilistic models used in these methods (e.g. Teahan et al, 2000) are trained on a segmented corpus which is not always available. $$$$$ Information retrieval systems often rank the results of each search, giving preference to documents that are more relevant to the query by placing them nearer the beginning of the list.
