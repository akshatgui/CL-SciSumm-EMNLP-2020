Using a statistical model called prediction by partial matching (PPM), Teahan et al (2000) reported a significantly better result. $$$$$ Next we show how space insertion can be viewed as a problem of hidden Markov modeling, and how higher-order models, such as the ones used in text compression, can be employed in this way.
Using a statistical model called prediction by partial matching (PPM), Teahan et al (2000) reported a significantly better result. $$$$$ However, if exclusion was exploited, both encoder and decoder will recognize that escape from order 1 to order 0 is inevitable because the order 1 model adds no characters that were not already predicted by the order 2 model.
Using a statistical model called prediction by partial matching (PPM), Teahan et al (2000) reported a significantly better result. $$$$$ It is true that most search engines allow the user to search for multiword phrases by enclosing them in quotation marks, and this facility could be used to search for multicharacter words in Chinese.

Treating each character individually as in (Teahan et al, 2000) requires a large amount of training data in order to calculate all the probabilities in the tables, as well as a large amount of table space and time to lookup data from the tables. $$$$$ When the training and testing files come from the same corpus, results are good, with around 42 (for PH) and 45 (for Rocling) errors per thousand words.

Treating each character individually as in (Teahan et al, 2000) requires a large amount of training data in order to calculate all the probabilities in the tables, as well as a large amount of table space and time to lookup data from the tables. $$$$$ The procedure continues, growing the trellis structure using an incremental strategy similar to that illustrated in Figure 6, but modified to take into account the new growth strategy of adding either the next character or the next character followed by a space.

Machine learning approaches are more desirable and have been successful in both unsupervised learning (Peng and Schuur mans, 2001) and supervised learning (Teahan et al, 2000). $$$$$ Existing techniques are either linguistically based, using a dictionary of words, or rely on hand-crafted segmentation rules, or use adaptive models that have been specifically created for the purpose of Chinese word segmentation.

In addition, compared to simple models like n-gram language models (Teahan et al, 2000), another shortcoming of CRF-based segmenters is that it requires significantly longer training time. $$$$$ This simple and general method performs well with respect to specialized schemes for Chinese language segmentation.

This is in contrast to supervised word segmentation algorithms (e.g., Teahan et al, 2000), which are typically used for segmenting text in documents written in languages that do not put spaces between their words like Chinese. $$$$$ The corrected version of Guo Jin's PH corpus and the Rocling corpus were provided by Julia Hockenmaier and Chris Brew at the University of Edinburgh and the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing Group of Academia Sirtica, respectively.
