Paraphrase generation methods that operate both on a single monolingual corpus or on parallel corpus are discussed by Madnani and Dorr 2010. $$$$$ Individual lexical items having the same meaning are usually referred to as lexical paraphrases or, more commonly, synonyms, for example, (hot, warm) and (eat, consume).
Paraphrase generation methods that operate both on a single monolingual corpus or on parallel corpus are discussed by Madnani and Dorr 2010. $$$$$ These alignment-oriented precision (Palign) and recall (Ralign) measures are computed as follows: where (s1,s2) denotes a sentence pair, NM(s1,s2) denotes the phrases extracted via the manual alignments for the pair (s1, s2), and NP(s1,s2) denotes the phrases extracted via the automatic alignments induced using the paraphrase method P that is to be evaluated.

The wide variety of techniques for acquiring phrasal paraphrases, which can subsequently be used by text paraphrasing techniques (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), the inherent polysemy of such linguistic units and the pragmatic constraints on their uses make it impossible to ensure that potential paraphrase pairs will be substitutable in any context, an observation which was already made at a lexical level (Zhao et al., 2007). $$$$$ Two parts were said to correspond if they could be substituted for each other within the specific context provided by the respective sentence pair.
