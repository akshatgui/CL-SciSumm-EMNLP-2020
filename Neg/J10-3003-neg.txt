For a more extensive survey on paraphrasing methods, see Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) and Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ A problem closely related to, and as important as, generating paraphrases is that of assigning a quantitative measurement to the semantic similarity of two phrases (Fujita and Sato 2008a) or even two given pieces of text (Corley and Mihalcea 2005; Uzuner and Katz 2005).
For a more extensive survey on paraphrasing methods, see Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) and Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ We also refrain from discussing work on purely lexical paraphrasing which usually comprises various ways to cluster words occurring in similar contexts (Inoue 1991; Crouch and Yang 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grefenstette 1994; Lin 1998; Gasperin et al. 2001; Glickman and Dagan 2003; Shimohata and Sumita 2005).1 Exclusion of general lexical paraphrasing methods obviously implies that other lexical methods developed just for specific applications are also excluded (Bangalore and Rambow 2000; Duclaye, Yvon, and Collin 2003; Murakami and Nasukawa 2004; Kauchak and Barzilay 2006).
For a more extensive survey on paraphrasing methods, see Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) and Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ Moreover, the task of automatically generating or extracting semantic equivalences for the various units of language— words, phrases, and sentences—is an important part of natural language processing (NLP) and is being increasingly employed to improve the performance of several NLP applications.

There are various data-driven approaches to this NLP-task (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), but they usually focus on lexical paraphrases and do not address the problem of sentence splitting, either. $$$$$ In addition, we believe that, given the difficulty of this task even for human annotators, adherence to strict semantic equivalence may not always be a suitable guideline and intrinsic evaluations must be very carefully designed.
There are various data-driven approaches to this NLP-task (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), but they usually focus on lexical paraphrases and do not address the problem of sentence splitting, either. $$$$$ Only recently have there been serious efforts to conduct research on the topic of paraphrasing by treating it as an important natural language processing task independent of a host application.

Madnani and Dorr (2010) survey a variety of data driven paraphrasing techniques, categorizing them based on the type of data that they use. $$$$$ Most recently, Cohn, Callison-Burch, and Lapata (2008) describe a different take on the creation of a monolingual parallel corpus containing 900 sentence pairs with paraphrase annotations that can be used for both development and evaluation of paraphrase systems.
Madnani and Dorr (2010) survey a variety of data driven paraphrasing techniques, categorizing them based on the type of data that they use. $$$$$ In recent years, a number of such fora have been made available to the automatic paraphrasing community (Inui and Hermjakob 2003; Tanaka et al. 2004; Dras and Yamamoto 2005; Sekine et al.
Madnani and Dorr (2010) survey a variety of data driven paraphrasing techniques, categorizing them based on the type of data that they use. $$$$$ Information extraction enables the detection of regularities of information structure—events which are reported many times, about different individuals and in different forms—and making them explicit so that they can be processed and used in other ways.
Madnani and Dorr (2010) survey a variety of data driven paraphrasing techniques, categorizing them based on the type of data that they use. $$$$$ However, a large portion of this research can be easily adapted for more widespread use outside its particular host and can provide significant benefits to the whole field.

It could be applied to other data driven paraphrasing techniques (see Madnani and Dorr (2010) for a survey). $$$$$ Looking towards the future, Dagan (2008) suggests that the textual entailment task provides a comprehensive framework for semantic inference and argues for building a concrete inference engine that not only recognizes entailment but also searches for all entailing texts given an entailment hypothesis H and, conversely, generates all entailed statements given a text T. Given such an engine, Dagan claims that paraphrase generation is simply a matter of generating all entailed statements given any sentence.

Paraphrase generation, on the other hand, has been an area of active research and the related work has been thoroughly surveyed in Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) as well as in Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ Entailment recognition systems sometimes rely on the use of paraphrastic templates or patterns as inputs (Iftene 2009) and might even use paraphrase recognition to improve their performance (Bosma and Callison-Burch 2007).
Paraphrase generation, on the other hand, has been an area of active research and the related work has been thoroughly surveyed in Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) as well as in Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ For some of the applications we discuss subsequently, the use of paraphrases in the manner described may not yet be the norm.
Paraphrase generation, on the other hand, has been an area of active research and the related work has been thoroughly surveyed in Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) as well as in Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ At the end, 67% of the sentence pairs were judged to be paraphrases of each other and the rest were judged to be non-equivalent.14 Although the MSRP Corpus is a valuable resource and its creation provided valuable insight into what constitutes a paraphrase in the practical sense, it does have some shortcomings.
Paraphrase generation, on the other hand, has been an area of active research and the related work has been thoroughly surveyed in Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) as well as in Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ As described herein, many paraphrase generation techniques are developed in the context of a host NLP application and this application usually serves as one form of extrinsic evaluation for the quality of the paraphrases generated by that technique.

A much more detailed discussion on the use of paraphrases and ways to extract them is given in (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ In order to extract paraphrases, they sample random paths in the graph from any English node to another.

A much more detailed discussion on the use of paraphrases and ways to extract them is given in (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ Because vectors that are more similar are more likely to have similar fingerprints, vectors (or distributions) can simply be compared by comparing their fingerprints, leading to a more efficient distributional similarity algorithm (Charikar 2002; Ravichandran, Pantel, and Hovy 2005).
A much more detailed discussion on the use of paraphrases and ways to extract them is given in (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ Once such a tabulation of bilingual phrasal correspondences is available, correspondences between phrases in one language may be inferred simply by using the phrases in the other language as pivots.

Paraphrase generation methods that operate both on a single monolingual corpus or on parallel corpus are discussed by Madnani and Dorr 2010. $$$$$ It has been widely reported that the existing bilingual word alignment techniques are not ideal for use in translation and, furthermore, improving these techniques does not always lead to an improvement in translation performance.
