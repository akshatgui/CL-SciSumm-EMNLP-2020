Work similar to that described here has been carried out by Merialdo (1994), with broadly similar conclusions. $$$$$ Of course, the real tags have not been generated by a probabilistic model and, even if they had been, we would not be able to determine this model exactly because of practical limitations.

Similar results are presented by Merialdo (1994), who describes experiments to compare the effect of training from a hand-tagged corpora and using the Baum-Welch algorithm with various initial conditions. $$$$$ Two approaches in particular are compared and combined: • using text that has been tagged by hand and computing relative frequency counts, • using text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a Maximum Likelihood principle.

We also did not consider morphological analyzers as a form of type supervision, as suggested by Merialdo (1994). $$$$$ Through these different approaches, some common points have emerged: These kinds of considerations fit nicely inside a probabilistic formulation of the problem (Beale 1985; Garside and Leech 1985), which offers the following advantages: In this paper we present a particular probabilistic model, the triclass model, and results from experiments involving different ways to estimate its parameters, with the intention of maximizing the ability of the model to tag text accurately.
We also did not consider morphological analyzers as a form of type supervision, as suggested by Merialdo (1994). $$$$$ 0:W--+T=0(W) There are (at least) two measures for the quality of a tagging procedure: In practice, performance at sentence level is generally lower than performance at word level, since all the words have to be tagged correctly for the sentence to be tagged correctly.

Merialdo (1994), in a now famous negative result, attempted to improve HMM POS tagging by expectation maximization with unlabeled data. $$$$$ However, the percentage of correct tags is relatively high (more than three out of four) because: Note that this behavior is obviously very dependent on the system of tags that is used.
