Similar results are presented by Merialdo (1994), who describes experiments to compare the effect of training from a hand-tagged corpora and using the Baum-Welch algorithm with various initial conditions. $$$$$ Of course, the real tags have not been generated by a probabilistic model and, even if they had been, we would not be able to determine this model exactly because of practical limitations.

We also did not consider morphological analyzers as a form of type supervision, as suggested by Merialdo (1994). $$$$$ In the probabilistic formulation of the tagging problem we assume that the alignments are generated by a probabilistic model according to a probability distribution: p(W, T) In this case, depending on the criterion that we choose for evaluation, the optimal tagging procedure is as follows: We call this procedure Viterbi tagging.

Merialdo (1994), in a now famous negative result, attempted to improve HMM POS tagging by expectation maximization with unlabeled data. $$$$$ Through these different approaches, some common points have emerged: These kinds of considerations fit nicely inside a probabilistic formulation of the problem (Beale 1985; Garside and Leech 1985), which offers the following advantages: In this paper we present a particular probabilistic model, the triclass model, and results from experiments involving different ways to estimate its parameters, with the intention of maximizing the ability of the model to tag text accurately.

We can surmise from the log-likelihood plot that the drop in accuracy is not due to the optimization being led astray, but probably rather due to the complex relationship between likelihood and task specific evaluation metrics in unsupervised learning (Merialdo, 1994). $$$$$ I would like to thank Peter Brown, Fred Jelinek, John Lafferty, Robert Mercer, Salim Roukos, and other members of the Continuous Speech Recognition group for the fruitful discussions I had with them throughout this work.
