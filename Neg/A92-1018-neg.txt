There are many POS taggers developed using different techniques for many major languages such as transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al, 1992), Markov model (Cutting et al, 1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc for English. $$$$$ In this context, a term is a word stem annotated with part of speech.

As a common strategy, POS guessers examine the endings of unknown words (Cutting et al 1992) along with their capitalization, or consider the distribution of unknown words over specific parts-of-speech (Weischedel et aL, 1993). $$$$$ Our implementation allows for two sorts of biasing of starting values: ambiguity classes can be annotated with favored tags; and states can be annotated with favored transitions.
