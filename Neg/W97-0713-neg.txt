 $$$$$ It has often been emphasized that agreement figures of the kinds computed above could be misleading (1Crippendorff, 1980, Passormeau and Litman, 1993) Since the &quot;true&quot; set of important textual units cannot be independently .known, we cannot compute how valid the importance assignments of the judges were Moreover, although the agreement figures that would occur by chance offer a strong indication that our data are reliable, they do not provide a precise measurement of reliability To compute a reliability figure, we followed the same methodology as Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1994) and applied the Cochran's Q summary statistics to our data (Cochran, 1950) Cochran's test assumes that a set of judges make binary decisions with respect to a dataset The null hypothesis is that the number of judges that take the same decision is randomly distributed Since Cochran's test is appropriate only for binary judgments and since our main goal was to determine a reliability figure for the agreement among judges with respect to what they believe to be important, we evaluated two versions of the data that reflected only one importance level In the first version we considered as being important the judgments with a Sarre of 2 and unimportant the judgments with a score of 0 and 1 In the second version, we considered as being important the judgments with a score of 2 and 1 and unimportant the judgments with a score of 0 Essentially, we mapped the judgment matrices of each of the five texts into matrices whose elements ranged over only two values 0 and 1 After these modifications were made, we computed for each version and each text the Cochran statistics Q, which approximates the )(2 distribution with n — 1 degrees of freedom, where ri is the number of elements in the dataset In all cases we obtained probabilities that were very low p < 10-6 MIS means that the agreement among judges was extremely significant Although the probability was very low for both versions, it was lower for the first version of the modified data than for the second This means that it is more reliable to consider as Important only the units that were assigned a score of 2 by a majority of the judges As we have already mentioned, our ultimate goal was to determine whether there exists a correlation between the units that judges find important and the units that have nuclear status in the rhetorical structure trees of the same texts Since the percentage agreement for the units that were considered very important was higher than the percentage agreement for the units that were considered less important, and since the Cochran's significance computed for the first version of the modified data was higher that the one computed for the second, we decided to consider the set of 36 textual units labeled by a majority of judges with 2 as a reliable reference set of importance units for the five texts For example, units 4 and 12 from text (1) belong to this reference set Agreement between analysts.

A variety of approaches exist for determining the salient sentences in the text $$$$$ Overall agreement among judges.

Some summarization systems assume that the importance of a sentence is derivable from a rhetorical representation of the source text (Marcu, 1997), while others leverage information from multiple texts to re-score the importance of conceptual units across all the sources (Hatzivassiloglou et al, 2001). $$$$$ Researchers in computational linguistics (Mann and Thompson, 1988, Matthiessen and Thompson, 1988, Sparck Jones, 1993) have long speculated that the nuclei that pertain to a rhetorical structure tree (RS-tree) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) constitute an adequate summanzation of the text for which that RS-tree was built However, to our knowledge, there was no experiment to confirm how valid this speculation really is In what follows, we describe an experiment that shows that there exists a strong correlation between the nuclei of the RS-tree of a text and what readers perceive to be the most important units in a text We know from the results reported in the psychological literature on summarization (Johnson, 1970, Chou Hare and Borchardt, 1984, Sherrard, 1989) that there exists a certain degree of disagreement between readers with respect to the importance that they assign to various textual units and that the disagreement is dependent on the quality of the text and the comprehension and summarization skills of the readers (Winograd.

Theories such as RST have been popular for sometime as a way of describing the multi-levelled rhetorical relations that exist in text, with relevant applications such as automatic summarization (Marcu, 1997) and natural language generation (Knott and Dale, 1996). $$$$$ Researchers in computational linguistics (Mann and Thompson, 1988, Matthiessen and Thompson, 1988, Sparck Jones, 1993) have long speculated that the nuclei that pertain to a rhetorical structure tree (RS-tree) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) constitute an adequate summanzation of the text for which that RS-tree was built However, to our knowledge, there was no experiment to confirm how valid this speculation really is In what follows, we describe an experiment that shows that there exists a strong correlation between the nuclei of the RS-tree of a text and what readers perceive to be the most important units in a text We know from the results reported in the psychological literature on summarization (Johnson, 1970, Chou Hare and Borchardt, 1984, Sherrard, 1989) that there exists a certain degree of disagreement between readers with respect to the importance that they assign to various textual units and that the disagreement is dependent on the quality of the text and the comprehension and summarization skills of the readers (Winograd.
