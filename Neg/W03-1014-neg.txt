Subjective sentences are sentences used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). $$$$$ Most importantly, the high-precision classifiers can generate a much larger set of labeled sentences than are currently available in manually created data sets.
Subjective sentences are sentences used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). $$$$$ Most of these algorithms require special training resources, such as texts annotated with domain-specific tags (e.g., AutoSlog (Riloff, 1993), CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995), RAPIER (Califf, 1998), SRV (Freitag, 1998), WHISK (Soderland, 1999)) or manually defined keywords, frames, or object recognizers (e.g., PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993) and LIEP (Huffman, 1996)).

Starting with the Romanian lexicon, we developed a lexical classifier similar to the one introduced by (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). $$$$$ Not surprisingly, longer expressions tend to be more idiomatic (and subjective) than shorter expressions (e.g., put an end (to) vs. put; is going to be vs. is going; was expectedfrom vs. was expected).
