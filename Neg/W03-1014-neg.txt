 $$$$$ This process allows us to generate a large set of labeled sentences automatically.
 $$$$$ Not surprisingly, longer expressions tend to be more idiomatic (and subjective) than shorter expressions (e.g., put an end (to) vs. put; is going to be vs. is going; was expectedfrom vs. was expected).
 $$$$$ The learning process has two steps.

Riloff and wiebe (2003) constructed a high precision classifier for contiguous sentences using the number of strong and weak subjective words in current and nearby sentences. $$$$$ The subjective patterns can also be added to the highprecision subjective sentence classifier as new features to improve its performance.

Riloff and wiebe (2003) constructed a high precision classifier for contiguous sentences using the number of strong and weak subjective words in current and nearby sentences. $$$$$ The specific representation of these patterns varies across systems, but most patterns represent role relationships surrounding noun and verb phrases.

 $$$$$ In our second experiment, we used the learned extraction patterns to classify previously unlabeled sentences from the unannotated text collection.
 $$$$$ The second class, which we call objective, consists of everything else.
 $$$$$ The learned patterns are then used to identify more subjective sentences.
 $$$$$ In general, the recall numbers increased by about 2-4% while the precision numbers decreased by less, from 0.5-2%.

Although this work aims at learning only nouns, in the subsequent work, they also proposed a bootstrapping method that can deal with phrases (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). $$$$$ This paper presents a bootstrapping process that learns linguistically rich extraction patterns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.

Subjective sentences are sentences used to express opinions, evaluations, and speculations (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003). $$$$$ AutoSlog-TS then ranks the extraction patterns using a metric called RlogF (Riloff, 1996) and asks a human to review the ranked list and make the final decision about which patterns to keep.

All trigrams are then scored according to their prevalence in relevant versus irrelevant documents (e.g. subjective vs. non-subjective sentences), following the scoring methodology of Riloff and Wiebe (2003). $$$$$ We begin with a strict measure of agreement at the sentence level by first considering whether the annotator marked any private-state expression, of any strength, anywhere in the sentence.
