Hedging is sometimes classed under the umbrella concept of subjectivity, which covers a variety of linguistic phenomena used to express differing forms of authorial opinion (Wiebe et al, 2004). $$$$$ This refers to a private state of the Foreign Ministry (i.e., it is very surprised).

This phenomenon, together with others used to express forms of authorial opinion, is often classified under the notion of subjectivity (Wiebe et al, 2004), (Shanahan et al, 2005). $$$$$ There are techniques for analyzing agreement when annotations involve segment boundaries (Litman and Passonneau 1995; Marcu, Romera, and Amorortu 1999), but our focus in this article is on words.

In contrast to the findings of Wiebe et al ((Wiebe et al, 2004)), who addressed the broader task of subjectivity learning and found that the density of other potentially subjective cues in the context benefits classification accuracy, we observed that the co-occurence of speculative cues in a sentence does not help in classifying a term as speculative or not. $$$$$ In addition to learning and evaluating clues associated with subjectivity, we address disambiguating them in context, that is, identifying instances of clues that are subjective in context (Sections 4.3 and 4.4).

On the other hand, Wiebe et al (2004) have noted that hap ax legomena (terms that only appear once in a collection of texts) are good signs for detecting subjectivity. $$$$$ The features, generated from different data sets using different procedures, exhibit consistency in performance in that they all do better and worse on the same data sets.

Accurate automatic analysis of these aspects of language will augment existing research in the fields of sentiment (Pang et al, 2002) and subjectivity analysis (Wiebe et al, 2004), but assessing the usefulness of analysis algorithms leveraging the Appraisal framework will require test data. $$$$$ We showed that unique words are subjective more often than expected and that unique words are valuable clues to subjectivity.

Wiebe et al (2004) proposed that whether a sentence is subjective or objective should be discriminated according to the adjectives in it. $$$$$ We explore this idea in the current work, assessing whether PSEs are more likely to be subjective if they are surrounded by subjective elements.
Wiebe et al (2004) proposed that whether a sentence is subjective or objective should be discriminated according to the adjectives in it. $$$$$ Two kinds of data are available to us: a relatively small amount of data manually annotated at the expression level (i.e., labels on individual words and phrases) of Wall Street Journal and newsgroup data and a large amount of data with existing documentlevel annotations from the Wall Street Journal (opinion pieces, such as editorials and reviews, versus nonopinion pieces).
