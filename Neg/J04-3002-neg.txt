Hedging is sometimes classed under the umbrella concept of subjectivity, which covers a variety of linguistic phenomena used to express differing forms of authorial opinion (Wiebe et al, 2004). $$$$$ But since the process is fully automatic, the feature could be applied to more unannotated text to identify regions containing subjective sentences.

In contrast to the findings of Wiebe et al ((Wiebe et al, 2004)), who addressed the broader task of subjectivity learning and found that the density of other potentially subjective cues in the context benefits classification accuracy, we observed that the co-occurence of speculative cues in a sentence does not help in classifying a term as speculative or not. $$$$$ We anticipate that knowledge of subjective language may be usefully exploited in a number of NLP application areas and hope that the work presented in this article will encourage others to experiment with subjective language in their applications.
