In addition to lexical translation, our system models structural changes and changes to feature values, for although dependency structures are fairly well preserved across languages (Fox, 2002), there are certainly many instances where the structure must be modified. $$$$$ Many of the initially daunting number of crossings were due to non-linguistic reasons, such as rewording during translation or errors in syntactic analysis.

The advantages of modeling how a target language syntax tree moves with respect to a source language syntax tree are that (i) we can capture the fact that constituents move as a whole and generally respect the phrasal cohesion constraints (Fox, 2002), and (ii) we can model broad syntactic reordering phenomena, such as subject-verb-object constructions translating into subject-object-verb ones, as is generally the case for English and Japanese. $$$$$ Table 3 shows the results of this analysis.
