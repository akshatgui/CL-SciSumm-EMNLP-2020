Fox (2002) shows that translation between English and French satisfies cohesion in the majority cases. $$$$$ However, what is really happening is that the whole verb phrase is first being moved without crossing anything else and then being translated as a unit.

Similar alternations are rife in bilingual data, e.g., ne pas in French (Fox, 2002) and separable prefixes in German (Collins et al 2005). $$$$$ Therefore, we would expect to see a comparable change to the number of crossings measured, and this is exactly what we find, as shown in Tables 4 and 5.

In addition to lexical translation, our system models structural changes and changes to feature values, for although dependency structures are fairly well preserved across languages (Fox, 2002), there are certainly many instances where the structure must be modified. $$$$$ This time, however, the percentages for both types of crossings (see Tables 6 and 7) decrease relative to the case of flattened verb phrases (from 15.12% to 12.62% for heads and from 10.59% to 9.22% for modifiers).

The advantages of modeling how a target language syntax tree moves with respect to a source language syntax tree are that (i) we can capture the fact that constituents move as a whole and generally respect the phrasal cohesion constraints (Fox, 2002), and (ii) we can model broad syntactic reordering phenomena, such as subject-verb-object constructions translating into subject-object-verb ones, as is generally the case for English and Japanese. $$$$$ The translation model captures the translation of source language words into the target language and the reordering of those words.
