We are aware of two methods that have been proposed for significance testing with BLUE $$$$$ In general the lack of per-sentence scores makes it challenging to apply significance tests to Bleu scores.2 To get around this problem, we make the following approximation.

But Collins et al (2005) note that it is not clear whether the conditions required by bootstrap resampling are met in the case of BLUE, and recommend the sign test instead. $$$$$ Translation performance is measured on a 2000 sentence test set from a different part of the Europarl corpus, with average sentence length of 28 words.
