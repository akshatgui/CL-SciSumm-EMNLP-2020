Most commonly, feature-based classifiers use a set of capitalisation features and a sentence-initial feature (Bikel et al, 1997). $$$$$ We will describe the various models employed, the methods for training these models and the method for &quot;decoding&quot; on test data (the term &quot;decoding&quot; borrowed from the speech recognition community, since one goal of traversing an HMM is to recover the hidden state sequence).

Nymble (Bikel et al, 1997) uses statistical learning to acquire a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that recognises NEs in text. $$$$$ By that we mean that the text of the document itself (including headlines but not including SGML tags) was 450,000 words long.

Nymble (Bikel et al, 1997) uses statistical learning to acquire a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that recognises NEs in text. $$$$$ Given the incredibly difficult nature of many NLP tasks, this example of a learned, stochastic approach to name-finding lends credence to the argument that the NLP community ought to push these approaches, to find the limit of phenomena that may be captured by probabilistic, finite-state methods.

Our chunk-based system takes the last word of the chunk as its head word for the purposes of predicting roles, but does not make use of the identities of the chunk's other words or the intervening words between a chunk and the predicate, unlike Hidden Markov Model-like systems such as Bikel et al (1997), McCallum et al (2000) and Laerty et al (2001). $$$$$ The unknown word–model can be viewed as a first level of back-off, therefore, since it is used as a backup model when an unknown word is encountered, and is necessarily not as accurate as the bigram model formed from the actual training.
