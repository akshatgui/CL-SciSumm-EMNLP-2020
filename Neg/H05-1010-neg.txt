For parameter optimization for the word alignment task, Taskar, Simon and Klein (Taskar et al, 2005) used a large margin approach by factoring the structure level constraints to constraints at the level of an alignment link. $$$$$ For example, when considering whether to align two words in the IBM models (Brown et al, 1990), one cannot easily include information about such features as orthographic similarity (for detecting cognates), presence of the pair in various dictionaries, similarity of the frequency of the two words, choices made by other alignment systems on this sentence pair, and so on.

It should be noted that previous word-alignment experiments such as Taskar, Simon and Klein (Taskar et al, 2005) have been done with very large datasets and there is little word-order variation in the languages involved. $$$$$ With just this feature on a pair of word tokens (which depends only on their types), we can already make a stab 77 at word alignment, aligning, say, each English word with the French word (or null) with thehighest Dice value (see (Melamed, 2000)), sim ply as a matching-free heuristic model.
