The next set of lookup levels described, in which the structural word is no longer the primary entity but just a handle for indexing graphs, can be built on the basis of knowledge assembled from large volumes of text; the methodology employed by Smadja and McKeown (1990) would be one of many techniques possible for obtaining and organizing the various levels of model graphs. $$$$$ Phrasal entries must be compiled by hand which is both expensive and incomplete.

Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ In this example, the sentential zone was not used since no phrasal template expresses its semantics.
Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ In this example, the logical form represents the fact that on the New York stock exchange, the advancing issues (semantic representation or semâ€”R: carinners) were ahead (predicate c:lead) of the losing ones (sem-R: c:losers) and that there were 3 times more winning issues than losing ones ratio).
Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ We address both problems in this paper, focusing on the acquisition problem.

 $$$$$ A degree of I is considered as a slim lead whereas a degree of 5 is a commanding margin.
 $$$$$ Phrasal entries must be compiled by hand which is both expensive and incomplete.
 $$$$$ In this example, the sentential zone was not used since no phrasal template expresses its semantics.
 $$$$$ We are currently working on extending Cook as well as developing a full sized from Xtract's output.

Previous studies have proposed many promising ways for this purpose, for instance, Smadja and McKeown (1990), and Frantzi and Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more general structures like collocations. $$$$$ The lex and sen-ft attributes specify the lexeme we are considering (&quot;advancers&quot;) and its semantic representation (cminners).
Previous studies have proposed many promising ways for this purpose, for instance, Smadja and McKeown (1990), and Frantzi and Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more general structures like collocations. $$$$$ Furthermore, phrasal entries tend to capture rather rigid, idiomatic expressions.
Previous studies have proposed many promising ways for this purpose, for instance, Smadja and McKeown (1990), and Frantzi and Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more general structures like collocations. $$$$$ In this section, we describe how Xtract can automatically produce the full range of collocations described above.
Previous studies have proposed many promising ways for this purpose, for instance, Smadja and McKeown (1990), and Frantzi and Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more general structures like collocations. $$$$$ It illustrates the choice of the verb to be used when &quot;advancers&quot; is the subject.
