The next set of lookup levels described, in which the structural word is no longer the primary entity but just a handle for indexing graphs, can be built on the basis of knowledge assembled from large volumes of text; the methodology employed by Smadja and McKeown (1990) would be one of many techniques possible for obtaining and organizing the various levels of model graphs. $$$$$ They are extremely rigid and long collocations.

Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ Some results are given in Table 1.
Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ Collocational knowledge is necessary for language gener- The problem collocations come in a large variety of forms.
Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ Language generation research on lexical choice has focused on syntactic and semantic constraints on word choice and word ordering.
Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ Both are relative to the predicate p: lead but they are used with different values of the degree attribute.

 $$$$$ The lex and sen-ft attributes specify the lexeme we are considering (&quot;advancers&quot;) and its semantic representation (cminners).
 $$$$$ Examples of such collocations are given in figure 2.2 Phrasal templates: consist of idiomatic phrases containing one, several or no empty slots.

Previous studies have proposed many promising ways for this purpose, for instance, Smadja and McKeown (1990), and Frantzi and Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more general structures like collocations. $$$$$ Only statistically significant word pairs are retained.
