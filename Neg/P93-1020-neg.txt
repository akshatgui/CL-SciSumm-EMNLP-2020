To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. $$$$$ Cochran's test assumes that the number of is within a single row of the matrix is fixed by observation, and that the totals across rows can vary.
To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. $$$$$ Figure 2 shows 2 boundaries (CUE) assigned by the algorithm, both due to and.
To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. $$$$$ Thus, total percent agreement could be very high, even if subjects did not agree on any boundaries.
To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. $$$$$ However, there is weak consensus on the nature of segments and the criteria for recognizing or generating them.

Additionally, the definition of what constitutes a majority is subjective (e.g., Passonneau and Litman (1993, p. 150), Litman and Passonneau (1995), Hearst (1993, p. 6) each used 4/7, 3/7, and $$$$$ As a baseline for examining the performance of our algorithms, we compare the boundaries produced by the algorithms to boundaries of strength Ti > 4.

Similar to (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we adopt a flat model of topic segmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents. $$$$$ Any other NP type provides a referential link if its index occurs in the immediately preceding FIC.

However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ A third person definite pronoun provides a referential link if its index occurs anywhere in the current segment.
However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Several researchers have begun to investigate the ability of humans to agree with one another on segmentation.
However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ For each narrative, our human segmentation data provides us with a set of boundaries classified by 7 levels of subject strength: (1 < Ti < 7).
However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Where the row totals are ui, the column totals are T, and the average column total is T, the statistic is given by: = Q approximates the X2 distribution with j-1 degrees of freedom (Cochran, 1950).

With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of "topic" that builds upon Passonneau and Litman's seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) asked subjects to structure three AP news stories (averaging 450 words in length) according to the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986).

With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of "topic" that builds upon Passonneau and Litman's seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ We present results of an empirical study of a large corpus of spontaneous oral narratives, with a large number of potential boundaries per narrative.
With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of "topic" that builds upon Passonneau and Litman's seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ The fallout and error rates of .09 (o-=.004) and .11 (o-=.003) more closely approximate the ideal scores of 0.

Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ We show that human subjects can reliably perform discourse segmentation using speaker intention as a criterion.
Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ Recall errors represent the false rejection of a boundary, while precision errors represent the false acceptance of a boundary.
Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ For the 20 narratives, the probabilities of the observed distributions range from p :7-- .114 x 10-6 top < .6 x 10-9.
Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ We have shown that boundaries agreed on by at least 4 subjects are very unlikely to be the result of chance.
