To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. $$$$$ Both authors' work was partially supported by DARPA and ONR under contract N00014-89-J-1782; Passonneau was also partly supported by NSF grant IRI-91-13064.

To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. $$$$$ We have investigated the correlation of our intention-based discourse segmentations with referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses.

Additionally, the definition of what constitutes a majority is subjective (e.g., Passonneau and Litman (1993, p. 150), Litman and Passonneau (1995), Hearst (1993, p. 6) each used 4/7, 3/7, and $$$$$ However, the algorithm has the potential to assign multiple boundaries between adjacent prosodic phrases.

We are optimistic that all three algorithms can be improved, for example, by discriminating among types of pauses, types of cue words, and features of referential NPs.

Similar to (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we adopt a flat model of topic segmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents. $$$$$ Further, the segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by many phenomena.

Similar to (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we adopt a flat model of topic segmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents. $$$$$ Subjects identified hierarchical structures of discourse segments, as well as local structural features, using text alone as well as text and professionally recorded speech.

However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ We have shown that boundaries agreed on by at least 4 subjects are very unlikely to be the result of chance.
However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Here, agreement among four, five, six, or seven subjects on whether or not there is a segment boundary between two adjacent prosodic phrases constitutes a majority opinion.
However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ In the next section we evaluate how well statistically validated boundaries correlate with the distribution of linguistic cues.
However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ In the case of narrative 9 (j=96), one of the subjects assigned 8 boundaries.

With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of "topic" that builds upon Passonneau and Litman's seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Several researchers have begun to investigate the ability of humans to agree with one another on segmentation.
With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of "topic" that builds upon Passonneau and Litman's seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Without the segmentation, the referent of the underlined noun phrase a man with a goat is a potential referent of the pronoun because it is the most recent noun phrase consistent with the number and gender restrictions of the pronoun.

Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ However, previous studies have shown that the smallest unit subjects use in similar tasks corresponds roughly to a breath group, prosodic phrase, or clause (Chafe, 1980; Rotondo, 1984; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992).
Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ The probability of a 1 in any of the j cells of the row is thus 8/96, with (986) ways for the 8 boundaries to be distributed.
