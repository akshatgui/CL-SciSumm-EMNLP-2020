Moore and Pollack (1992) note that Rhetorical Structure Theory conflates the informational (the information being conveyed) and intentional (the effects on the reader's beliefs or attitudes) levels of discourse. $$$$$ (1992).

Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ H: (c) We don't need to go to the hardware store.
Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ Of course, if the system can recover the intentional relations from the informational ones, then it will suffice for the system to record only the latter.
Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ Indeed, there will be potentially n x m relations created from a theory that initially includes n informational relations and m intentional relations.
Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ Utterance (b) is the nucleus of the CONDITION relation, and, similarly, it is the nucleus of the ENABLEMENT relation on the first reading.

For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONDITION for B3. $$$$$ In other words, a hearer may be able to determine what the speaker is trying to do because of what the hearer knows about the world or what she knows about what the speaker believes about the world.
For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONDITION for B3. $$$$$ Although Hovy did not cleanly separate intentional from informational level relations, a version of his approach might be developed in which definitions are given only for informational (or, alternatively, intentional) level relations, and the results field of each definition is used to specify an associated intentional (informational) relation.

However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classifiers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ However, RST analyses presume that, for any two consecutive elements of a coherent discourse, one rhetorical relation will be primary.
However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classifiers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ Thus, an approach such as Hovy's that is based on multi-relation definitions will result in a proliferation of definitions.

Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both informational (semantic) and intentional relations can hold between clause simultaneously and independently. $$$$$ Just as one cannot always recover intentional relations from informational ones, neither can one always recover informational relations from intentional ones.

Finally, sometimes more than one relation can hold between two given units (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ Alternatively, the hearer may be able to figure out what the speaker believes about the world by recognizing what the speaker is trying to do in the discourse.
