Moore and Pollack (1992) gave an example of a simple discourse. $$$$$ Moreover, the nucleus/satellite structure of the informational level relation is maintained only on one of these readings.

Moore and Pollack (1992) note that Rhetorical Structure Theory conflates the informational (the information being conveyed) and intentional (the effects on the reader's beliefs or attitudes) levels of discourse. $$$$$ &quot;Planning text for advisory dialogues: Capturing intentional, rhetorical and attentional information.&quot;
Moore and Pollack (1992) note that Rhetorical Structure Theory conflates the informational (the information being conveyed) and intentional (the effects on the reader's beliefs or attitudes) levels of discourse. $$$$$ We thus conclude that in RST, and, indeed, in any viable theory of discourse structure, analyses at the informational and the intentional levels must coexist.

Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ &quot;Planning text for advisory dialogues: Capturing intentional, rhetorical and attentional information.&quot;
Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ However, on the second reading, it is utterance (a) that is the nucleus of the MOTIVATION relation.
Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ In other words, a hearer may be able to determine what the speaker is trying to do because of what the hearer knows about the world or what she knows about what the speaker believes about the world.

For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONDITION for B3. $$$$$ &quot;Planning text for advisory dialogues: Capturing intentional, rhetorical and attentional information.&quot;
For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONDITION for B3. $$$$$ Coming home by 5:00 (a) is a condition on going to the hardware store (b), and together these are a condition on finishing the bookshelves (c): The intentional and informational structures for this discourse are not isomorphic.
For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONDITION for B3. $$$$$ First, as we have argued, there is not a fixed, one-to-one mapping between intentional and informational level relations.
For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONDITION for B3. $$$$$ Again using the knowledge that one way for the speaker to increase her belief in a proposition is to describe a plausible cause of that proposition, the hearer in this case can conclude that House Bill 1711 must be something that a big business supporter would opposeâ€”in other words that (a) may be a cause of (b).

However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classifiers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ However, as Moore and Paris have argued, such recovery is not possible because there is not a one-to-one mapping between intentional and informational relations.
However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classifiers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ One might imagine modifying RST to include multi-relation definitions, i.e., definitions that ascribe both an intentional and an informational relation to consecutive discourse elements.

Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both informational (semantic) and intentional relations can hold between clause simultaneously and independently. $$$$$ However, she is in a conversational situation in which she expects the speaker to support the claim that Bush will veto it.

Finally, sometimes more than one relation can hold between two given units (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ We are grateful to Barbara Grosz, Kathy McCoy, Cecile Paris, Donia Scott, Karen Sparck Jones, and an anonymous reviewer for their comments on this research.
Finally, sometimes more than one relation can hold between two given units (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ Indeed, there will be potentially n x m relations created from a theory that initially includes n informational relations and m intentional relations.
