Eisenstein et al (Eisenstein et al, 2010) show promising results in identifying an author's geographic location from micro-blogs, but the locations are coarse-grained and rely on a substantial message history per-source. $$$$$ We see this work as a first step towards a unsupervised methodology for modeling linguistic variation using raw text.
Eisenstein et al (Eisenstein et al, 2010) show promising results in identifying an author's geographic location from micro-blogs, but the locations are coarse-grained and rely on a substantial message history per-source. $$$$$ In some regions, estimates of many of these factors may be obtained by cross-referencing geography with demographic data.
Eisenstein et al (Eisenstein et al, 2010) show promising results in identifying an author's geographic location from micro-blogs, but the locations are coarse-grained and rely on a substantial message history per-source. $$$$$ Variational scheduling and initialization are important aspects of any hierarchical generative model, and are often under-discussed.

For example, Eisenstein et al (2010) demonstrated a model that predicted where an author was located in order to analyze regional distinctions in communication. $$$$$ All differences in performance between systems are statistically significant (p < .01) using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for regression error and the k2 test for classification accuracy.

For the Twitter dataset, an additional parameter is a threshold on the number of feeds each word occurs in: in the preprocessed splits of Eisenstein et al (2010), all vocabulary items that appear in fewer than 40 feeds are ignored. $$$$$ Note that the geographic topic model and the mixture of unigrams use identical code and parametrization – the only difference is that the geographic topic model accounts for topical variation, while the mixture of unigrams sets K = 1.
