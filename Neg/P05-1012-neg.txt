The recent advances in parsing have achieved parsers with O(n3) time complexity without the grammar constant (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ Learning a model from the Czech training data is somewhat problematic since it contains some crossing dependencies which cannot be parsed by the Eisner algorithm.

 $$$$$ The trained parsers achieve a competitive dependency accuracy for both English and Czech with no language specific enhancements.
 $$$$$ Furthermore, the model can be augmented to include features over lexicalized phrase structure parsing decisions to increase dependency accuracy over those parsers.
 $$$$$ For example, in the dependency tree of Figure 1, the following feature would have a value of 1: In general, any real-valued feature may be used, but we use binary features for simplicity.

 $$$$$ Besides performance (see Section 3), the approach to dependency parsing we described has several other advantages.
 $$$$$ Informally, this update looks to create a margin between the correct dependency tree and each incorrect dependency tree at least as large as the loss of the incorrect tree.
 $$$$$ Thus, the largest loss a dependency tree can have is the length of the sentence.
