The recent advances in parsing have achieved parsers with O(n3) time complexity without the grammar constant (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ This removes the need for the additional head indices of the O(n5) algorithm and requires only two additional binary variables that specify the direction of the item (either gathering left dependents or gathering right dependents) and whether an item is complete (available to gather more dependents).

 $$$$$ The models that search the entire space will not suffer from bad approximations made early in the search and thus are more likely to identify the correct root, whereas the approximate algorithms are prone to error propagation, which culminates with attachment decisions at the top of the tree.

A dependency-based system using MST Parser (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ These features are added for both the entire words as well as the 5-gram prefix if the word is longer than 5 characters.

This may be partially compensated for by including features about the surrounding words (McDonald et al., 2005), but any feature templates which would be identical across the two contexts will be in tension. $$$$$ The model based on MIRA also performs well on Czech, again slightly outperforming averaged perceptron.

 $$$$$ Ratnaparkhi’s conditional maximum entropy model (Ratnaparkhi, 1999), trained to maximize conditional likelihood P(y|x) of the training data, performed nearly as well as generative models of the same vintage even though it scores parsing decisions in isolation and thus may suffer from the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).

 $$$$$ Our training algorithms are iterative.
 $$$$$ Therefore, dependency parsing is a potential “sweet spot” that deserves investigation.
 $$$$$ We tested our methods experimentally on the English Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and on the Czech Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc, 1998).
 $$$$$ The Czech parser of Collins et al. (1999) was run on a different data set and most other dependency parsers are evaluated using English.

Many of the features above were introduced in McDonald et al (2005a); specifically, the node type, inside, and edge features. $$$$$ Efficient parsing for bilexical context-free grammars and head-automaton grammars.

Many of the features above were introduced in McDonald et al (2005a); specifically, the node type, inside, and edge features. $$$$$ We evaluated the system on both English and Czech data to display state-of-theart performance without any language specific enhancements.

In turn, those features were inspired by successful previous work in first order dependency parsing (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ In particular, we used the method of Collins et al. (1999) to simplify part-of-speech tags since the rich tags used by Czech would have led to a large but rarely seen set of POS features.
In turn, those features were inspired by successful previous work in first order dependency parsing (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ Using a slightly modified version of a lexicalized CKY chart parsing algorithm, it is possible to generate and represent these sentences in a forest that is O(n5) in size and takes O(n5) time to create.
In turn, those features were inspired by successful previous work in first order dependency parsing (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ Since the dependencies returned from our system are better than those actually learnt by the Collins parser, one could argue that our model is actually learning to parse dependencies more accurately.
In turn, those features were inspired by successful previous work in first order dependency parsing (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ However, there are cases where crossing dependencies may occur, as is the case for Czech (Hajiˇc, 1998).

Although (McDonald et al, 2005) used the prefix of each word form instead of word form itself as features, character-level features here for Chinese is essentially different from that. $$$$$ We present an effective training algorithm for linearly-scored dependency parsers that implements online largemargin multi-class training (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2003) on top of efficient parsing techniques for dependency trees (Eisner, 1996).
Although (McDonald et al, 2005) used the prefix of each word form instead of word form itself as features, character-level features here for Chinese is essentially different from that. $$$$$ However, phrase structure parsers are built to maximize the accuracy of the phrase structure and use lexicalization as just an additional source of information.
Although (McDonald et al, 2005) used the prefix of each word form instead of word form itself as features, character-level features here for Chinese is essentially different from that. $$$$$ The reparsing cost is already quite high for simple context-free models with O(n3) parsing complexity, but it becomes prohibitive for lexicalized grammars with O(n5) parsing complexity.

The latest state-of-the-art statistical dependency parsers are discriminative, meaning that they are based on classifiers trained to score trees, given a sentence, either via factored whole-structure scores (McDonald et al, 2005a) or local parsing decision scores (Hall et al, 2006). $$$$$ This is a well known discriminative training trick — using the suggestions of a generative system to influence decisions.
