 $$$$$ So, given a fixed correspondence between the tree leaves (i.e. words) across components, choosing the optimal structure for one component is tantamount to choosing the optimal synchronous structure for all components.7 Ignoring the nonterminal labels, only one dependency structure is compatible with these constraints – the one indicated by dashed arrows.
 $$$$$ Figure 1 shows some of the ways in which ordinary parsing can be generalized.

 $$$$$ Logical descriptions of inference algorithms involve inference rules: means that can be inferred from and .
 $$$$$ The possible translations are determined by consulting the grammar.
