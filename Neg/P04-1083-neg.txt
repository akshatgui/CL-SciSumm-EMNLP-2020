Recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (Brown et al, 1993) and phrase based (Koehn et al, 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (Chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (Melamed, 2004). $$$$$ Therefore, we shall describe these algorithms in terms of their underlying logics and grammars, abstracting away the semirings and search strategies, in order to elucidate how the different classes of algorithms are related to each other.

To handle syntactic differences, Melamed (2004) proposes methods based on tree-to-tree mappings. $$$$$ Bootstrapping a PMTG from a lower-dimensional PMTG and a word-to-word translation model is similar in spirit to the way that regular grammars can help to estimate CFGs (Lari & Young, 1990), and the way that simple translation models can help to bootstrap more sophisticated ones (Brown et al., 1993).
