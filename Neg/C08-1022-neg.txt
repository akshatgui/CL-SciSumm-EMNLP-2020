In the context of automated preposition and determiner error correction in L2 English, De Felice and Pulman (2008) noted that the process is often disrupted by misspellings. $$$$$ Prepositions and determiners are known to be oneof the most frequent sources of error for L2 En glish speakers, a finding supported by our analysisof a small error-tagged corpus we created (determiners 17% of errors, prepositions 12%).

In the context of automated preposition and determiner error correction in L2 English, De Felice and Pulman (2008) noted that the process is often disrupted by misspellings. $$$$$ contexts may be more or less uniquely identifiable, or they mayhave more or fewer senses, leading to less confusion for the classifier.

 $$$$$ The field of research in natural language processing (NLP) applications for L2 language is constantly growing.
 $$$$$ This is largely driven by the ex panding population of L2 English speakers, whose varying levels of ability may require different types of NLP tools from those designed primarily for native speakers of the language.
 $$$$$ Additional preposi tion features refer to the grade of any adjectives or adverbs modified (base, comparative, superlative) and to whether the items modified are modified by more than one PP 1 . In De Felice and Pulman (2007), we described some of the preprocessing required and offered some motivation for this approach.
