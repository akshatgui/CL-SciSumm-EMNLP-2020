 $$$$$ The ability to automatically provide summaries of heterogeneous material will critically help in the effective use of the Internet in order to avoid overload with information.
 $$$$$ SUMMONS, on the other hand, focuses on conceptual summarization of both structured and full-text data.
 $$$$$ The rest of this section describes the summarizer, specifying the planning operators used for summarization as well as a detailed discussion of the summarization algorithm showing how summaries of different length are generated.
 $$$$$ Our summary generator could be used both for evaluating message understanding systems by using the summaries to highlight differences between systems and for identifying weaknesses in the current systems.

Radev and McKeown (1998) point out when summarizing interesting news events from multiple sources, one can expect reports with contradictory and redundant information. $$$$$ By using automated, statistical techniques to find additional phrases, we could increase the size of the lexicon and use the additional phrases to identify new summarization strategies to add to our stock of operators.

While template-based representations have been proposed for information merging in the past (Radev and McKeown, 1998), they considered only domain-specific scenarios. $$$$$ First and foremost is the need to use statistical techniques to increase the robustness and vocabulary of the system.

This is particularly problematic in the case of multi-document summarization, where sentences extracted from related documents are very likely to express similar information in different ways (Radev and McKeown, 1998). $$$$$ We present a methodology for summarization of news about current events in the form of briefings that include appropriate background (historical) information.

Existing work in abstractive summarization has been quite limited and can be categorized into two categories: (1) approaches using prior knowledge (Radev and McKeown, 1998). $$$$$ We show how planning operators can be used to synthesize summary content from a set of templates, each representing a single article.
