However, Fung and Church (1994) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English. $$$$$ It remains an open question how we might be able to align a broader class of texts, especially those that are written in different character sets and share relatively few character sequences.
However, Fung and Church (1994) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English. $$$$$ Various methods have been proposed for aligning texts in two or more languages such as the Canadian Parliamentary Debates (Hansards).

As Fung and Church (1994) we wish to estimate the bilingual lexicon directly. $$$$$ Some of these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as a by-product.

 $$$$$ Ideally, we would like to apply the K-vec algorithm to all pairs of English and French words, but unfortunately, there are too many such pairs to consider.
