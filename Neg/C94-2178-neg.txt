However, Fung and Church (1994) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English. $$$$$ Some of these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as a by-product.

As Fung and Church (1994) we wish to estimate the bilingual lexicon directly. $$$$$ For example, it discovers that the English word fisheries is similar to the French p~ches by noting that the distribution of fisheries in the English text is similar to the distribution of p~ches in the French.

As Fung and Church (1994) we wish to estimate the bilingual lexicon directly. $$$$$ There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text: Brown et al(1990, 1991, 1993), Chen (1993), Church (1993), Church et al(1993), Dagan et al(1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rgsenschein (1993), Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993), Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993), Shemtov (1993), Simard et al(1992), Warwick- Armstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear).
As Fung and Church (1994) we wish to estimate the bilingual lexicon directly. $$$$$ Most of this work has been focused on European language pairs, especially English-French.

 $$$$$ The problem, of course, is that we don't have enough pieces.
 $$$$$ We want to know whether the distribution of numbers in Table 1 is similar to those in Table 2, and if so, we will suspect hat fisheries and p~ches are translations of one another.
 $$$$$ Various methods have been proposed for aligning texts in two or more languages such as the Canadian Parliamentary Debates (Hansards).
