In the Conceptual Case Frame Acquisition project (RiloffandSchmelzenbach, 1998), extraction patterns, a domain semantic lexicon, and a list of conceptual roles and associated semantic categories for the domain are used to produce multiple-slot case frames with selectional restrictions. $$$$$ The words are ranked by this score and the top five are dynamically added to the seed word list.

In related unsupervised tasks, Riloff and colleagues have learned case frames for verbs (e.g., Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), while Gildea (2002) has learned role slot mappings (but does not apply the knowledge for the labelling task). $$$$$ Figure 3 shows the semantic profile for the pattern &quot;attack on <nounphrase>&quot; .

There are number of different existing approaches for identifying semantic roles, varying from traditional parsing approaches, for example using HPSG grammars and Lexical Functional Grammars, that strongly rely on manually developed grammars and lexicons, to data-driven approaches, for example AutoSlog (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998). $$$$$ Another advantage of our approach is its highly empirical nature; a corpus often reveals important patterns in a domain that are not necessarily intuitive to people.

Applying such a model to information extraction, in AutoSlog Riloff (1993) builds a list of patterns for filling in semantic slots in a specific domain, as well as a method for automatic acquisition of case frames (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998). $$$$$ To evaluate the case frames, we used the same corpus and evaluation metrics as previous experiments with AutoSlog and AutoSlogTS (Riloff, 1996b) so that we can draw comparisons between them.
