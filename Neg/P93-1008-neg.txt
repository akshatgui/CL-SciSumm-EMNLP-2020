In a test set containing 26 repairs (Dowding et al, 1993), they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 84.6%; for correction, they obtained a recall rate of 30% and a recall rate of 62%. $$$$$ The only other types needed by Gemini are the value spaces used by features.

Typed Unification Grammars (TUG), like HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) and Gemini (Dowding et al. 1993) are a more expressive formalism in which to write formal grammars. $$$$$ We believe a robust system can still recognize and disprefer utterances containing recognition errors.

We use the Open Agent Architecture (Martin et al 1999) for communication between agents based on the Nuance speech recognizer, the Gemini natural language system (Dowding et al 1993), and Festival speech synthesis. $$$$$ Consider, for example, the choice between two unlabeled bracketings of (2a): There is a shift for each word and a reduce for each right bracket.
