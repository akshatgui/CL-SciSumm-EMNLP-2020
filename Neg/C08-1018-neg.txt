 $$$$$ Crucially, our second grammar will not contain com pression rules, just paraphrasing ones.

For example, one may want a text to be shorter (Cohn and Lapata, 2008), tailored to some reader profile (Zhu et al, 2010), compliant with some specific norms (Max, 2004), or more adapted for subsequent machine processing tasks (Chandrasekar et al., 1996). $$$$$ We present a new corpus that is suitedto our task and a discriminative tree-to tree transduction model that can naturallyaccount for structural and lexical mis matches.

Moreover, models developed for sentence compression have been mostly designed with one rewrite operation in mind, namely word deletion, and are thus unable to model consistent syntactic effects such as reordering, sentence splitting, changes in non-terminal categories, and lexical substitution (but see Cohn and Lapata 2008 and Zhao et al 2009 for notable exceptions). $$$$$ Also our task is doubly subjective in deciding which information to remove from the sentence and how to rewrite it.
