Our bottom-up deterministic parser adopts Nivre's algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a preprocessor. $$$$$ Since deterministic dependency parsing has previously been shown to be competitive in terms of parsing accuracy (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004), we believe that this is a promising approach for situations that require parsing to be robust, efficient and (almost) incremental.

The parser is a bottom-up deterministic dependency parser based on the algorithm proposed by (Nivre, 2004). $$$$$ In a dependency structure, every word token is dependent on at most one other word token, usually called its head or regent, which means that the structure can be represented as a directed graph, with nodes representing word tokens and arcs representing dependency relations.
The parser is a bottom-up deterministic dependency parser based on the algorithm proposed by (Nivre, 2004). $$$$$ A dependency graph D = (W, A) is wellformed iff the five conditions given in Figure 2 are satisfied.

The main part of our dependency parser is based on Nivre' s algorithm (Nivre, 2004), in which the dependency relations are constructed by a bottom up deterministic schema. $$$$$ Incrementality in parsing has been advocated for at least two different reasons.
The main part of our dependency parser is based on Nivre' s algorithm (Nivre, 2004), in which the dependency relations are constructed by a bottom up deterministic schema. $$$$$ By contrast, parsers that only partially disambiguate the input — partial parsing — are usually deterministic and construct the final analysis in one pass over the input (Abney, 1991; Daelemans et al., 1999).
The main part of our dependency parser is based on Nivre' s algorithm (Nivre, 2004), in which the dependency relations are constructed by a bottom up deterministic schema. $$$$$ Moreover, we have shown that in practical parsing, the algorithm performs incremental processing for the majority of input structures.

If we consider transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008), the purely bottom-up strategy is implemented by the arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ And in pure dependency parsing without nonterminal symbols, every reduction requires that one of the tokens reduced is the head of the other(s).
If we consider transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008), the purely bottom-up strategy is implemented by the arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ This claim is substantiated with experimental evidence showing that the algorithm achieves incremental parsing for 68.9% of the input when tested on a random sample of Swedish text.
If we consider transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008), the purely bottom-up strategy is implemented by the arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ It seems fair to conclude that, although strict word-by-word incrementality is not possible in deterministic dependency parsing, the arc-eager algorithm can in practice be seen as a close approximation of incremental parsing.

Nivre (2004) investigated the issue of (strict ) incrementality for this type of parsers ;i.e., if at any point of the analysis the processed input forms one connected structure. $$$$$ When restricted to sentences that are accepted by the parser, the degree of incrementality increases to 87.9%.

Nivre (2004) investigated the issue of (strict ) incrementality for this type of parsers ;i.e., if at any point of the analysis the processed input forms one connected structure. $$$$$ On the other hand, since it is no longer necessary to shift both tokens to be combined onto the stack, and since any tokens that are popped off the stack are connected to some token on the stack, we can require that the graph (5, AS) should be connected at all times, where AS is the restriction of A to 5, i.e.

Incrementality is not strict here in the sense of (Nivre, 2004), because sometimes more than one word is needed before parts of the frame are constructed and out put $$$$$ However, most state-of-the-art parsing methods today do not adhere to the principle of incrementality, for different reasons.
Incrementality is not strict here in the sense of (Nivre, 2004), because sometimes more than one word is needed before parts of the frame are constructed and out put $$$$$ In this way, arcs will be added to the dependency graph as soon as the respective head and dependent are available, even if the dependent is not complete with respect to its own dependents.

When restricted to these three transitions, the system is equivalent to the so-called stack-based arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ Since deterministic dependency parsing has previously been shown to be competitive in terms of parsing accuracy (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004), we believe that this is a promising approach for situations that require parsing to be robust, efficient and (almost) incremental.
When restricted to these three transitions, the system is equivalent to the so-called stack-based arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ It is interesting to note that if we recast the problem of dependency parsing as context-free parsing with a CNF grammar, then the problematic structures (1), (6–7) in Figure 4 all correspond to rightbranching structures, and it is well-known that bottom-up parsers may require an unbounded amount of memory in order to process rightbranching structure (Miller and Chomsky, 1963; Abney and Johnson, 1991).

When restricted to these three transitions, the system is equivalent to the so-called stack-based arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ One of the observations made by Abney and Johnson (1991), is that arc-eager strategies for context-free parsing may sometimes require less space than arcstandard strategies, although they may lead to an increase in local ambiguities.

This idea has been applied to constituency parsing, for example in Sagae and Lavie (2006), and we describe below a simple variant for dependency parsing similar to Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and the arc-standard version of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ When restricted to sentences that are accepted by the parser, the degree of incrementality increases to 87.9%.

The parsing algorithm is the arc-standard method (Nivre, 2004), which is briefly described in Section 2. $$$$$ Thus, we can say that the action performed by the Right-Reduce transition in the standard bottom-up algorithm is performed by a Right-Arc transition in combination with a subsequent Reduce transition in the arc-eager algorithm.

We implement three transition-based dependency parsers with three different parsing algorithms $$$$$ The parser is defined in the form of a transition system, represented in Figure 3 (where wi and wj are arbitrary word tokens): the two topmost tokens on the stack, wi and wj, by a right-directed arc wi —* wj and reduces them to the head wi.
We implement three transition-based dependency parsers with three different parsing algorithms $$$$$ Since there are no nonterminal nodes in a dependency graph, top-down construction means that a head is attached to a dependent before the dependent is attached to (some of) its dependents, whereas bottomup construction means that a dependent is attached to its head before the head is attached to its head.
We implement three transition-based dependency parsers with three different parsing algorithms $$$$$ However, we have also shown that the arc-eager parsing algorithm is optimal for incremental dependency parsing, given the constraints imposed by the overall framework.
