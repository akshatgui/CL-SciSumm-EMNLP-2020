Our bottom-up deterministic parser adopts Nivre's algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a preprocessor. $$$$$ In order to increase the incrementality of deterministic dependency parsing, we need to combine bottom-up and top-down processing.
Our bottom-up deterministic parser adopts Nivre's algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a preprocessor. $$$$$ In this way, arcs will be added to the dependency graph as soon as the respective head and dependent are available, even if the dependent is not complete with respect to its own dependents.
Our bottom-up deterministic parser adopts Nivre's algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a preprocessor. $$$$$ It seems fair to conclude that, although strict word-by-word incrementality is not possible in deterministic dependency parsing, the arc-eager algorithm can in practice be seen as a close approximation of incremental parsing.

The parser is a bottom-up deterministic dependency parser based on the algorithm proposed by (Nivre, 2004). $$$$$ We will formalize deterministic dependency parsing in a way which is inspired by traditional shift-reduce parsing for context-free grammars, using a buffer of input tokens and a stack for storing previously processed input.

The main part of our dependency parser is based on Nivre' s algorithm (Nivre, 2004), in which the dependency relations are constructed by a bottom up deterministic schema. $$$$$ The input string W is accepted if the dependency graph D = (W, A) given at termination is well-formed; otherwise W is rejected.

If we consider transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008), the purely bottom-up strategy is implemented by the arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ Deterministic dependency parsing has recently been proposed as a robust and efficient method for syntactic parsing of unrestricted natural language text (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2003).

Incrementality is not strict here in the sense of (Nivre, 2004), because sometimes more than one word is needed before parts of the frame are constructed and out put: into the right, for instance, needs to wait for a word like leg that completes the chunk. $$$$$ However, most state-of-the-art parsing methods today do not adhere to the principle of incrementality, for different reasons.
