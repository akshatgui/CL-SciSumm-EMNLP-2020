Galley et al (2004) extract translation rules from a large parsed parallel corpus that extend in scope to tree fragments beyond a single node; we believe that adding such larger-scale operations to the translation model is likely to significantly improve the performance of syntactically supervised alignment. $$$$$ Let us refer to the symbol tree that we want to derive as the target tree.
Galley et al (2004) extract translation rules from a large parsed parallel corpus that extend in scope to tree fragments beyond a single node; we believe that adding such larger-scale operations to the translation model is likely to significantly improve the performance of syntactically supervised alignment. $$$$$ Fox (2002) identified three major causes of crossings between English and French: the “ne ... pas” construct, modals and adverbs, which a child-reordering model doesn’t account for.

In terms of tree-to-string translation rule extraction, the toolkit implements the traditional maximum likelihood algorithm using PCFG trees (Galley et al, 2004) and HPSG trees/forests (Wu et al, 2010). $$$$$ Similarly, for each node t of T, we can define created(t, D) to be the step of derivation D during which t is created.

In particular, we implemented the GHKM algorithm as proposed by Galley et al (2004) from word-aligned tree string pairs. $$$$$ For the FBIS corpus (representing eight million English words), we automatically generated word-alignments using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), which we trained on a much larger data set (150 million words).

 $$$$$ But our main interest is in collecting a large set of such rules automatically through corpus analysis.
 $$$$$ Previous to Fox (2002), it had been observed that this model would prohibit certain re-orderings in certain language pairs (such as subjectVP(verb-object) into verb-subject-object), but Fox carried out the first careful empirical study, showing that many other common translation patterns fall outside the scope of the child-reordering model.
 $$$$$ For instance, the closure of 1s2, s3, s5, s71 would be 1s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s71 The alignment graph in Figure 5 is annotated with the span of each node.
 $$$$$ The x-axis represents different restrictions on the size of these rules: if we use a model that restrict rules to a single expansion of a non-terminal into a sequence of symbols, we are in the scope of the child-reordering model of (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Fox, 2002).

For the tree-to-string model, we parsed English sentences using Stanford parser and extracted rules using the GHKM algorithm (Galley et al, 2004). $$$$$ We evaluated the coverage of our model of transformation rules with two language pairs: English-French and English-Chinese.
For the tree-to-string model, we parsed English sentences using Stanford parser and extracted rules using the GHKM algorithm (Galley et al, 2004). $$$$$ We use our theory to introduce a linear algorithm that can be used to derive from word-aligned, parallel corpora the minimal set of syntactically motivated transformation rules that explain human translation data.

Language modeling (Chen and Goodman, 1996), noun-clustering (Ravichandran et al, 2005), constructing syntactic rules for SMT (Galley et al, 2004), and finding analogies (Turney, 2008) are examples of some of the problems where we need to compute relative frequencies. $$$$$ In these models, a crossing remains between MD and AUX no matter how VPs are flattened.

From word level alignments, such systems extract the grammar rules consistent either with the alignments and parse trees for one of languages (Galley et al., 2004), or with the the word-level alignments alone without reference to external syntactic analysis (Chiang, 2005), which is the scenario we address here. $$$$$ Our theory makes no a priori assumptions about the transformations that one is permitted to learn.

GHKM (Galley et al, 2004) is used to generate the baseline TTS templates based on the word alignments computed using GIZA++ and different combination methods, including union and the diagonal growing heuristic (Koehn et al, 2003). $$$$$ • This theory can be generalized quite cleanly to include derivations for which substrings are replaced by sets of trees, rather than one single tree.

Galley et al (2004) describe how to learn hundreds of millions of tree transformation rules from a parsed, aligned Chinese/English corpus, and Galley et al (submitted) describe probability estimators for those rules. $$$$$ We also chose French to compare our study with that of Fox (2002).

In order to test whether good translations can be generated with rules learned by Galley et al (2004), we created DerivTool as an environment for interactively using these rules as a decoder would. $$$$$ Fox’s solution to the problem of crossings is to flatten verb phrases.

Finally, we show that our contextually richer rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over those of (Galley et al, 2004). $$$$$ For the former, we present results for the three alignments: S alignments, P alignments, and the alignments computed by GIZA++.

In this paper, we developed probability models for the multi-level transfer rules presented in (Galley et al, 2004), showed how to acquire larger rules that crucially condition on more syntactic context, and how to pack multiple derivations, including interpretations of unaligned words, into derivation forests. $$$$$ For this reason, we think it is important to learn from the model/data explainability studies of Fox (2002) and to extend her results.

Typically, by using the GHKM algorithm (Galley et al 2004), translation rules are learned from word-aligned bilingual texts whose source side has been parsed by using a syntactic parser. $$$$$ However, higher level syntactic constituents are more problematic for child-reordering models, and the main reasons they fail to provide explanation of the parses at the sentence level.
