In terms of tree-to-string translation rule extraction, the toolkit implements the traditional maximum likelihood algorithm using PCFG trees (Galley et al, 2004) and HPSG trees/forests (Wu et al, 2010). $$$$$ One can easily imagine a range of techniques for defining probability distributions over the rules that we learn.

 $$$$$ In these models, a crossing remains between MD and AUX no matter how VPs are flattened.
 $$$$$ The input to the rule are the roots of the elements of the derivation string that are replaced (where we define the root of a symbol to be simply the symbol itself), whereas the output of the rule is a symbol tree, except that some of the leaves are labeled with variables instead of symbols from the target alphabet.

From word level alignments, such systems extract the grammar rules consistent either with the alignments and parse trees for one of languages (Galley et al., 2004), or with the the word-level alignments alone without reference to external syntactic analysis (Chiang, 2005), which is the scenario we address here. $$$$$ Each plotted value represents a percentage of parse trees in a corpus that can be transformed into a target sentence using transformation rules.
