More recently, a domain independent system has been trained on general function tags such as Manner and Temporal by Blaheta and Charniak (2000). $$$$$ From this we calculated the empirical probabilities of each function tag referenced in section 2 of this paper.

These features are generated using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and a function tagger (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000). $$$$$ The main reason that tagging does worse on the parsed version is that although the constituent itself may be correctly bracketed and labelled, its exterior conditioning information can still be incorrect.
These features are generated using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and a function tagger (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000). $$$$$ For each constituent in the tree, we calculated the likelihood of each function tag according to the feature tree in figure 4, and for each category (see figure 2) we assigned the most likely function tag (which might be the null tag).
These features are generated using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and a function tagger (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000). $$$$$ The denominator of the accuracy measure should be the maximum possible number we could get correct.
