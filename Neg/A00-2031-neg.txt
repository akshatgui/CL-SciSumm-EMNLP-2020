In function labeling level, EXT that signifies degree, amount of the predicates should be grouped into adverbials like in the work of (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000) and (Merlo and Musillo, 2005). $$$$$ We believe the latter number (`nonull') to be a better performance metric, as it is not overwhelmed by the large number of untagged constituents.

The difference in the accuracy is due to two reasons.
