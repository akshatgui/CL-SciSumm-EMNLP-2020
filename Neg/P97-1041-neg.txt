Palmer (1997) conducted a Chinese segmenter which merely made use of a manually segmented corpus (without referring to any lexicon). $$$$$ For a discussion of recent Chinese segmentation work, see Sproat et al. (1996). frequently mentioned in segmentation papers that native speakers of a language do not always agree about the &quot;correct&quot; segmentation and that the same text could be segmented into several very different (and equally correct) sets of words by different native speakers.

Palmer (1997) conducted a Chinese segmenter which merely made use of a manually segmented corpus (without referring to any lexicon). $$$$$ The training set consisted of 2675 sentences (64632 words) in which all the spaces had been removed; the test set was a separate set of 700 sentences (16318 words) from the same corpus (also with all spaces removed).

In general, the word segmentation program utilizes the word entries, part-of-speech (POS) information (Chen and Liu, 1992) in a monolingual dictionary, segmentation rules (Palmer, 1997), and some statistical information (Sproat, et al, 1994). $$$$$ This greedy algorithm produced an initial score of F=64.4.

 $$$$$ The current state of our algorithm, in which only three characters are considered at a time, will understandably perform better with a language like Chinese than with an alphabetic language like Thai, where average word length is much greater.
 $$$$$ As a stand-alone segmenter, we show our algorithm to produce high performance Chinese segmentation.
 $$$$$ This paper presents a trainable rule-based algorithm for performing word segmentation.

This approach was used by Palmer (1997) for word segmentation. $$$$$ For example, since word segmentation is merely a preprocessing task for a wide variety of further tasks such as parsing, information extraction, and information retrieval, different segmentations can be useful or even essential for the different tasks.
This approach was used by Palmer (1997) for word segmentation. $$$$$ The rule-based algorithm we developed to improve word segmentation is very effective for segmenting Chinese; in fact, the rule sequences combined with a very simple initial segmentation, such as that from a maximum matching algorithm, produce performance comparable to manually-developed segmenters.

One may note that the error reductions here are smaller than Palmer (1997)'s error reductions. $$$$$ As demonstrated by the experiment with the NMSU segmenter, the rule sequence algorithm can also be used to improve the output of an already highly-accurate segmenter, thus producing one of the best segmentation results reported in the literature.
One may note that the error reductions here are smaller than Palmer (1997)'s error reductions. $$$$$ This variation of the greedy algorithm, using the same list of 57472 words, produced an initial score of F=82.9.
One may note that the error reductions here are smaller than Palmer (1997)'s error reductions. $$$$$ The transformation-based algorithm involves applying and scoring all the possible rules to training data and determining which rule improves the model the most.

In Palmer (1997), the baseline is how well an existing system performs before the rules are run. $$$$$ The learning algorithm also considers the entire training set at all learning steps, rather than decreasing the size of the training data as learning progresses, such as is the case in decision-tree induction (Quinlan, 1986).
In Palmer (1997), the baseline is how well an existing system performs before the rules are run. $$$$$ There are three main types of transformations which can act on the current state of an imperfect segmentation: In our syntax, Insert and Delete transformations can be triggered by any two adjacent characters (a bigram) and one character to the left or right of the bigram.
In Palmer (1997), the baseline is how well an existing system performs before the rules are run. $$$$$ Our algorithm learned 5903 transformations from the 2000 sentence training set.
In Palmer (1997), the baseline is how well an existing system performs before the rules are run. $$$$$ Roughly 80% of the data was used to train the segmentation algorithm, and 20% was used as a blind test set to score the rules learned from the training data.

For example, (Palmer, 1997) developed a Chinese word segmenter using a manually segmented corpus. $$$$$ Modifying or retargeting an existing segmentation algorithm to produce a different segmentation can be difficult, especially if it is not clear what and where the systematic differences in segmentation are.
