Palmer (1997) conducted a Chinese segmenter which merely made use of a manually segmented corpus (without referring to any lexicon). $$$$$ Wu and Fung (1994) demonstrate that segmentation accuracy is significantly higher when the lexicon is constructed using the same type of corpus as the corpus on which it is tested.

In general, the word segmentation program utilizes the word entries, part-of-speech (POS) information (Chen and Liu, 1992) in a monolingual dictionary, segmentation rules (Palmer, 1997), and some statistical information (Sproat, et al, 1994). $$$$$ In addition, we show the transformation-based algorithm to be effective in improving the output of several existing word segmentation algorithms in three different languages.

 $$$$$ This paper presents a trainable rule-based algorithm for performing word segmentation.
 $$$$$ A major difficulty in evaluating segmentation algorithms is that there are no widely-accepted guidelines as to what constitutes a word, and there is therefore no agreement on how to &quot;correctly&quot; segment a text in an unsegmented language.
 $$$$$ Consequently, an algorithm which scores extremely well compared to one native segmentation may score dismally compared to other, equally &quot;correct&quot; segmentations.
 $$$$$ Slide transformations can be triggered by a sequence of one, two, or three characters over which the boundary is to be moved.

This approach was used by Palmer (1997) for word segmentation. $$$$$ This paper presents a trainable rule-based algorithm for performing word segmentation.
This approach was used by Palmer (1997) for word segmentation. $$$$$ For our experiments, we obtained corpora which had been manually segmented by native or nearnative speakers of Chinese and Thai.
This approach was used by Palmer (1997) for word segmentation. $$$$$ In addition, we are also able to provide a more detailed error analysis of the English segmentation (since the author can read English but not Thai).
This approach was used by Palmer (1997) for word segmentation. $$$$$ This variation of the greedy algorithm, using the same list of 57472 words, produced an initial score of F=82.9.

Our work adds an existing system to improve the rules learned, while Palmer (1997) adds rules to improve an existing system's performance. $$$$$ It is rule-based, but relies on 'See, for example, Sproat et al. (1996). machine learning to acquire the rules, rather than expensive manual knowledge engineering.

One may note that the error reductions here are smaller than Palmer (1997)'s error reductions. $$$$$ The difference in the greedy scores for English and Thai demonstrates the dependence on the word list in the greedy algorithm.

One may note that the error reductions here are smaller than Palmer (1997)'s error reductions. $$$$$ For example, since word segmentation is merely a preprocessing task for a wide variety of further tasks such as parsing, information extraction, and information retrieval, different segmentations can be useful or even essential for the different tasks.
One may note that the error reductions here are smaller than Palmer (1997)'s error reductions. $$$$$ It differs from other common corpus-based methods in several ways.

In Palmer (1997), the baseline is how well an existing system performs before the rules are run. $$$$$ Acknowledgements This work would not have been possible without the assistance and encouragement of all the members of the MITRE Natural Language Group.

In Palmer (1997), the baseline is how well an existing system performs before the rules are run. $$$$$ In the maximum matching algorithm described above, when a sequence of characters occurred in the text, and no subset of the sequence was present in the word list, the entire sequence was treated as a single word.
In Palmer (1997), the baseline is how well an existing system performs before the rules are run. $$$$$ In this experiment, when such a sequence of characters was encountered, each of the characters was treated as a separate word, as in the CAW algorithm above.

The use of TBL for Chinese word segmentation was first suggested in Palmer (1997). $$$$$ If no match is found in the word list, the greedy algorithm simply skips that character and begins the search starting at the next character.

The use of TBL for Chinese word segmentation was first suggested in Palmer (1997). $$$$$ The simple syntax described in Section 2.2 can, however, be easily extended to consider larger contexts to the left and the right of boundaries; this extension would necessarily come at a corresponding cost in learning speed since the size of the rule space searched during training would grow accordingly.
The use of TBL for Chinese word segmentation was first suggested in Palmer (1997). $$$$$ The rule-based algorithm we developed to improve word segmentation is very effective for segmenting Chinese; in fact, the rule sequences combined with a very simple initial segmentation, such as that from a maximum matching algorithm, produce performance comparable to manually-developed segmenters.
