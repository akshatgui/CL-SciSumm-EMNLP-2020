Chodorow and Leacock (2000) try to identify errors on the basis of context, as we do here, and more specifically a 2 word window around the word of interest, from which they consider function words and POS tags. $$$$$ They identify the intended sense of a word in a novel sentence by extracting its contextual cues and selecting the most similar word sense model (e.g., Leacock, Chodorow and Miller (1998), Yarowsky (1993)).

For example, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) exploit bigrams and trigrams of function words and part-of-speech (PoS) tags, while Sun et al (2007) use labeled sequential patterns of function, time expression, and part-of-speech tags. $$$$$ We present an unsupervised method for detecting grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from edited textual corpora.
For example, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) exploit bigrams and trigrams of function words and part-of-speech (PoS) tags, while Sun et al (2007) use labeled sequential patterns of function, time expression, and part-of-speech tags. $$$$$ These words were randomly selected from those which met two criteria: (1) They appear in a university word list (Nation, 1990) as words that a student in a US university will be expected to encounter and (2) there were at least 1,000 sentences containing the word in the TOEFL essay pool.

For example, unsupervised systems of (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) and (Tsao and Wible, 2009) leverage word distributions in general and/or word-specific corpus for detecting erroneous usages while (Hermet et al, 2008) and (Gamon and Leacock, 2010) use Web as a corpus. $$$$$ Park, Palmer and Washburn (1997) adapted a categorial grammar to recognize &quot;classes of errors [that] dominate&quot; in the nine essays they inspected.
