However, this method does not work for realworld datasets such as PASCAL RTE (Dagan et al., 2006), because of the knowledge bottleneck $$$$$ In the end wnoverlap is normalised by dividing it by the sum of all weights of the lemmas in the hypothesis.
However, this method does not work for realworld datasets such as PASCAL RTE (Dagan et al., 2006), because of the knowledge bottleneck $$$$$ In Section 4 we test their accuracy and robustness on the RTE datasets as one of the few currently available datasets for textual inference.
However, this method does not work for realworld datasets such as PASCAL RTE (Dagan et al., 2006), because of the knowledge bottleneck $$$$$ Can the methods presented improve significantly over the baseline and what are the per formance differences between them?

On PASCAL RTE datasets, strict logical inference is known to have very low recall (Bos and Markert, 2005), so on-the-fly knowledge is crucial in this setting. $$$$$ This can be achieved by in corporating them in QA or summarisation systems.Acknowledgements We would like to thank Mirella Lapata and Malvina Nissim as well as three anonymous review ers for their comments on this paper.

Bos and Markert (2005) proposes features from a model builder; Raina et al (2005) proposes an abduction process; Tatu and Moldovan (2006) shows handcrafted rules could drastically improve the performance of a logic-based RTE system. $$$$$ Still, it will be unavoidable to incor porate automatic methods for knowledge acquisition to increase the performance of our approach.
