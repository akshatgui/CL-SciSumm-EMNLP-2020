In our model, we adopted the subtree kernel method for the shortest path dependency kernel (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ This transparency allows us to easily restrict the types of patterns counted by the kernel to types that we deem relevant for relationextraction.
In our model, we adopted the subtree kernel method for the shortest path dependency kernel (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ For the shortest-path kernels, the semantics is known bydefinition: each path feature corresponds to a dimen sion in the Hilbert space.

It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the in formation required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ The NEAR relation indicates the proximity of one location to another.
It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the in formation required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ We present a novel approach to relation extraction, based on the observation thatthe information required to assert a rela tionship between two named entities in the same sentence is typically capturedby the shortest path between the two entities in the dependency graph.
It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the in formation required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ In general, we shall find a shortest sequence of predicate-argument structures with target predicates P1, P2, ..., Pn such that e1 is an argument of P1, e2 isan argument of Pn, and any two consecutive predi cates Pi and Pi+1 share a common argument (whereby ?argument?

The respective dependency parse tree is included through following the shortest dependency path hypothesis (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), by using the syntactical and dependency information of edges (e) and vertices (v). $$$$$ Local and non-local (deep) dependencies are equally important for finding relations.
The respective dependency parse tree is included through following the shortest dependency path hypothesis (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), by using the syntactical and dependency information of edges (e) and vertices (v). $$$$$ The second example is an interesting case,as it illustrates how annotation decisions are accom modated in our approach.
The respective dependency parse tree is included through following the shortest dependency path hypothesis (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), by using the syntactical and dependency information of edges (e) and vertices (v). $$$$$ The performance howeverdepends not only on the amount of syntactic infor mation, but also on the details of the exact modelsusing this information.

It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest path between any two entities captures the information required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ A Context Free Grammar (CFG) parser can be used to extract local dependencies, which for each sentence form a dependency tree.

It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the information required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ Recent research (Roth and Yih, 2004) indicates thatintegrating entity recognition with relation extraction in a global model that captures the mutual influ ences between the two tasks can lead to significant improvements in accuracy.

It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the information required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ In Figure 1 we show the full dependency graphs for two sentences from the ACE newspaper corpus.Word-word dependencies are typically catego rized in two classes as follows:?
It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the information required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ This mayhave the advantage of preserving the quality of local dependencies while completing the representa tion with non-local dependencies.Currently, the method assumes that the named entities are known.

The information in the shortest path between two entities in a dependency tree can be used to assert whether a relationship exists between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ In this paper we tried extracting both types of dependencies using a CCG parser, however another approach is to recover deepdependencies from syntactic parses, as in (Camp bell, 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004).
The information in the shortest path between two entities in a dependency tree can be used to assert whether a relationship exists between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ Comparative experiments on extracting top-level relations from the ACE corpus show significant improvements over a recent dependency tree kernel.

The information in the shortest path between two entities in a dependency tree can be used to assert whether a relationship exists between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ Other types of word-word dependen cies account for modifier-head relationships present in adjective-noun compounds (?several ? stations?), noun-noun compounds (?pumping ? stations?), or adverb-verb constructions (?recently ? raided?).

 $$$$$ Comparative experiments on extracting top-level relations from the ACE corpus show significant improvements over a recent dependency tree kernel.
 $$$$$ Eventhough exhaustive experiments comparing the per formance of a relation extraction system based on these four levels of syntactic information are yet tobe conducted, a reasonable assumption is that the extraction accuracy increases with the amount of syn tactic information used.
 $$$$$ In the case of the tree kernels from (Zelenko et al, 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), the authors reduce each relation example to the smallest subtree in the parse or dependency tree that includes both entities.
