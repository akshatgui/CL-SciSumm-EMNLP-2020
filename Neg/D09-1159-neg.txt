A previous work that used structured kernels in Sentiment Analysis is the approach of Wu et al (2009). $$$$$ Since the cross-domain training set is larger than the original one in Diaper and DVD domain, the models are trained more sufficiently.

The results showed by Wu et al (2009) suggest that tree kernels on dependency trees are a good approach but we also plan to employ string kernels on this task. $$$$$ The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their useful comments.

We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines $$$$$ Subject and aspect belong to product features, while evaluation is the opinion expression in our work.
We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines $$$$$ They identified expressions of opinions, sources of opinions and the linking relation that exists between them.
We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines $$$$$ For evaluations on cross domain, the Adjacent method doesn’t need training data, its results are the same as the in-domain experiments.
We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines $$$$$ In order to measure the annotation quality, we use the following metric to measure the inter-annotator agreement, which is also used by Wiebe et al. (2005). as the result, the local words are not involved in In this section, we describe the annotated corpus and experiment configurations including baseline We conducted experiments with labeled corpus which are selected from Hu and Liu (2004), Jindal and Liu (2008) have built.

Afterwards, Wu et al (2009) utilized the dependency parser to extract the noun phrases and verb phrases from the reviews as the aspect candidates. $$$$$ The novelties of our work included: 1) we defined the phrase dependency parsing and proposed an approach to construct the phrase dependency trees; 2) we proposed a new tree kernel function to model the phrase dependency trees.

Phrase dependency grammars have recently been used by Wu et al (2009) for feature extraction for opinion mining. $$$$$ The other domains are used as testing set.

Phrase dependency grammars have recently been used by Wu et al (2009) for feature extraction for opinion mining. $$$$$ By taking advantage of the observation that a lot of product features are phrases, a concept of phrase dependency parsing is introduced, which extends traditional dependency parsing to phrase level.

For a monolingual task, Wu et al (2009) used a shallow parser to convert lexical dependencies from a dependency parser into phrase dependencies. $$$$$ The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their useful comments.

For a monolingual task, Wu et al (2009) used a shallow parser to convert lexical dependencies from a dependency parser into phrase dependencies. $$$$$ A further inspection into the result of first 3 domains, we can also conclude that: 1) Tree kernels(SVM-WTree and SVM-PTree) are better than Adjacent, SVM-1 and SVM-2 in all domains.

We compared our approach against two state-of-the art methods $$$$$ We focused on extracting relations between product features and opinion expressions.
We compared our approach against two state-of-the art methods $$$$$ Because phrase dependency parsing naturally divides the dependencies into local and global, a novel tree kernel method has also been proposed.
We compared our approach against two state-of-the art methods $$$$$ Consider the following sentences: and its size(4) [cannot be beat](4).
We compared our approach against two state-of-the art methods $$$$$ As millions of users contribute rich information to the Internet everyday, an enormous number of product reviews are freely written in blog pages, Web forums and other consumer-generated mediums (CGMs).

For example, Wu et al (2009) identified aspects based on the features explored by dependency parser. $$$$$ We use this definition as the basis for our opinion mining task.
For example, Wu et al (2009) identified aspects based on the features explored by dependency parser. $$$$$ Retrieving this information and analyzing this content are impossible tasks if they were to be manually done.
For example, Wu et al (2009) identified aspects based on the features explored by dependency parser. $$$$$ The main difference between the first three domains and the last two domains is the size of data(Table 1).

A wide spectrum of tasks have been studied under review mining, ranging from coarse-grained document-level polarity classification (Pang et al,2002) to fine-grained extraction of opinion expressions and their targets (Wu et al, 2009). $$$$$ Because phrase dependency parsing naturally divides the dependencies into local and global, a novel tree kernel method has also been proposed.
