A more common, extractive approach operates top-down, by starting from an extracted sentence that is compressed (Dorr et al, 2003) and annotated with additional information (Zajic et al, 2004). $$$$$ For this evaluation we used 100 headlines created for 100 AP stories from the TIPSTER collection for August 6, 1990 as reference summarizations for those stories.

A more common, extractive approach operates top-down, by starting from an extracted sentence that is compressed (Dorr et al, 2003) and annotated with additional information (Zajic et al, 2004). $$$$$ These results show that although Hedge Trimmer scores slightly higher than HMM Hedge on both data sets, the results are not statistically significant.

HedgeTrimmer is our implementation of the Hedge Trimer system (Dorr et al, 2003), and Topiary is our implementation of the Topiary system (Zajicet al, 2004). $$$$$ However, we believe that the difference in the quality of the systems is not adequately reflected by this automatic evaluation.
HedgeTrimmer is our implementation of the Hedge Trimer system (Dorr et al, 2003), and Topiary is our implementation of the Topiary system (Zajicet al, 2004). $$$$$ We performed a subsequent study in which two subjects created 100 headlines for 100 AP stories from August 6, 1990.

For this reason, most early headline generation work focused on either extracting and reordering n-grams from the document to be summarized (Banko et al., 2000), or extracting one or two informative sentences from the document and performing linguistically-motivated transformations to them in order to reduce the summary length (Dorr et al., 2003). $$$$$ We found that at least one fluent and accurate headline meeting the criteria was created for each of the stories.

Hedge Trimmer (Dorr et al, 2003) is a system that creates a headline for an English newspaper story using linguistically-motivated heuristics to choose a potential headline. $$$$$ In this paper we will refer to this statistical system as HMM Hedge We demonstrate the effectiveness of our linguistically-motivated approach, Hedge Trimmer, over the probabilistic model, HMM Hedge, using both human evaluation and automatic metrics.
Hedge Trimmer (Dorr et al, 2003) is a system that creates a headline for an English newspaper story using linguistically-motivated heuristics to choose a potential headline. $$$$$ The practice of selecting words from the early part of the document has been justified by analyzing the behavior of humans doing the task, and by automatic evaluation of a system operating on a similar principle.

 $$$$$ The input to Hedge is a story, whose first sentence is immediately passed through the BBN parser.
 $$$$$ Note that, across the board, the percentages are higher in this analysis than in the results shown in Figure 3 (ranging from 12% higher—in the case of trailing PPs—to 1500% higher in the case of time expressions), indicating that our choices of deletion in the Hedge Trimmer algorithm are well-grounded.
