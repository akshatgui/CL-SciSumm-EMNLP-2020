The parser itself is an algorithm which searches for the tree, Tb„t, that maximises 'P(T 1 S).

Substantial improvements have been made to parse western language such as English, and many powerful models have been proposed (Brill 1993, Collins 1997). $$$$$ (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94) describe a history-based approach which uses decision trees to estimate P(TIS).

This model is very similar to the markovized rule models in Collins (1997). $$$$$ The work makes two advances over previous models: First, Model 1 performs significantly better than (Collins 96), and Models 2 and 3 give further improvements — our final results are 88.1/87.5% constituent precision/recall, an average improvement of 2.3% over (Collins 96).
This model is very similar to the markovized rule models in Collins (1997). $$$$$ The algorithm scored 41%/18% precision/recall on the 60 cases in section 23 - but infinitival relatives are extremely difficult even for human annotators to distinguish from purpose clauses (in this case, the infinitival could be a purpose clause modifying 'called') (Ann Taylor, p.c.) rather than Ps(Li, P, H I I, h, distances), and that there are the additional probabilities of generating the head and the STOP symbols for each constituent.

Answer Extraction $$$$$ This paper has proposed a generative, lexicalised, probabilistic parsing model.
Answer Extraction $$$$$ Second, the parsers in (Collins 96) and (NIagerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94) produce trees without information about whmovement or subcategorisation.
Answer Extraction $$$$$ Neither of these models is generative, instead they both estimate 'P(T 1 S) directly.

Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing have emphasized the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (Collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly, but context-free phrase-structure grammars do not. $$$$$ This improves parsing performance, and, more importantly, adds useful information to the parser's output.

The supervised component is Collins' parser (Collins, 1997), trained on the Wall Street Journal. $$$$$ It would be useful to identify &quot;Marks&quot; as a subject, and &quot;Last week&quot; as an adjunct (temporal modifier), but this distinction is not made in the tree, as both NPs are in the same position' (sisters to a VP under an S node).

 $$$$$ In our notation, he decomposes P(RHSi I LHS) as P(R,,...R1HL1..L, I P,h) x Penn treebank annotation style leads to a very large number of context-free rules, so that directly estimating 'P(R7,...R1HL1..Lin I P, h) may lead to sparse data problems, or problems with coverage (a rule which has never been seen in training may be required for a test data sentence).
