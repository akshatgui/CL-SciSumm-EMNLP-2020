These sentences were parsed with the Collins' parser (Collins, 1997). $$$$$ Most importantly, the probability of generating the STOP symbol will be 0 when the subcat frame is non-empty, and the probability of generating a complement will be 0 when it is not in the subcat frame; thus all and only the required complements will be generated.
