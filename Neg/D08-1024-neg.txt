As proposed by Haddow et al (2011), BLEU is approximately computed in the local batch, since BLEU is not linearly decomposed into a sentence wise score (Chiang et al, 2008a), and optimization for sentence-BLEU does not always achieve optimal parameters for corpus-BLEU. $$$$$ Building on the work of Watanabe et al., we explore the use of the MIRA algorithm of Crammer et al. as an alternative to MERT.

MBUU is a batch update mode which updates the weight with all training examples, but MIRA is an online one which updates with each example (Watanabe et al 2007) or part of examples (Chiang et al 2008). $$$$$ Thanks to Michael Bloodgood for performing initial simulations of parallelized perceptron training.

We incorporate all our new features into a linear model and learn weights for each using the online averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) with a few modifications for structured outputs inspired by Chiang et al (2008). $$$$$ When the whole training process is finished, we simply average all the weight vectors from all the processors.

We conjecture both these issues will be ameliorated with syntactic features such as those in Chiang et al (2008). $$$$$ We then test the method on two classes of features that address deficiencies in the Hiero hierarchical phrasebased model: first, we simultaneously train a large number of Marton and Resnik’s soft syntactic constraints, and, second, we introduce a novel structural distortion model.

The perceptron algorithm itself compares favorably to related learning techniques such as the MIRA adaptation of Chiang et al (2008). $$$$$ To address this defect, we can classify every nonterminal pair occurring on the right-hand side of each grammar rule as “reordered” or “not reordered”, that is, whether it intersects any other word alignment link or nonterminal pair (see Figure 2).

Building on this paper, the most recent work to our knowledge has been done by Chiang et al (2008). $$$$$ A hierarchical phrase-based translation model is based on synchronous context-free grammar, but does not normally use any syntactic information derived from linguistic knowledge or treebank data: it uses translation rules that span any string of words in the input sentence, without regard for parser-defined syntactic constituency boundaries.

Optimizing over translation forests gives similar stability benefits to recent work on lattice-based minimum error rate training (Macherey et al, 2008) and large-margin training (Chiang et al, 2008). $$$$$ In some cases, the model will be able to learn a preference for shorter-distance reorderings, as in a phrase-based system, but in the case of a word being reordered across a nonterminal, or two nonterminals being reordered, there is no dependence in the model on the size of the nonterminal or nonterminals involved in reordering.
