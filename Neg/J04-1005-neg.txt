To assess this classification task we also used the kappa statistics which yielded KCo=0.922 (following (Eugenio and Glass, 2004) we report Kas KCo, indicating that we calculate K a la Cohen (Cohen, 1960). $$$$$ A coefficient of for nominal scales.

To assess this classification task we also used the kappa statistics which yielded KCo=0.922 (following (Eugenio and Glass, 2004) we report Kas KCo, indicating that we calculate K a la Cohen (Cohen, 1960). $$$$$ Adjusted for prevalence, κCo yields a measure that is equal to 2P(A) − 1.

Feinstein and Cicchetti (1990), followed by Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) proved that Kappa is subject to the effect of prevalence and that different marginal distributions can lead to very different Kappa values for the same observed agreement. $$$$$ The problem is compounded by the following obvious effect on r. values: If P(A) is kept constant, varying values for P(E) yield varying values of r.. What can affect P(E) even if P(A) is constant are prevalence and bias.

Feinstein and Cicchetti (1990), followed by Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) proved that Kappa is subject to the effect of prevalence and that different marginal distributions can lead to very different Kappa values for the same observed agreement. $$$$$ To use κCo but to guard against bias, Cicchetti and Feinstein (1990) suggest that κCo be supplemented, for each coding category, by two measures of agreement, positive and negative, between the coders.
Feinstein and Cicchetti (1990), followed by Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) proved that Kappa is subject to the effect of prevalence and that different marginal distributions can lead to very different Kappa values for the same observed agreement. $$$$$ Although this behavior follows squarely from κ’s definition, it is at odds with using κ to assess a coding scheme.

But Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) have found that this interpretation does not hold true for all tasks. $$$$$ Second, κ is affected by skewed distributions of categories (the prevalence problem) and by the degree to which the coders disagree (the bias problem).

Ever since its introduction in general (Cohen, 1960) and in computational linguistics (Carletta, 1996), many researchers have pointed out that there are quite some problems in using κ (e.g. (Di Eugenio and Glass, 2004)), one of which is the discrepancy between p0 and κ for skewed class distribution. $$$$$ This work is supported by grant N00014-00-1-0640 from the Office of Naval Research.
