 $$$$$ We demonstrated that the model indeed discovers corresponding coherent topics and achieves accuracy in sentence labeling comparable to a standard supervised model.
 $$$$$ Online reviews are often accompanied with numerical ratings provided by users for a set of service or product aspects.
 $$$$$ The proposed approach is general and can be used for segmentation in other applications where sequential data is accompanied with correlated signals.

However, these two models either require post processing to calculate the positive/negative coverage in a document for polarity identification (Mei et al, 2007) or require some kind of supervised setting in which review text should contain ratings for aspects of interest (Titov and McDonald, 2008a). $$$$$ Sentiment classification is a well studied problem (Wiebe, 2000; Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002) and in many domains users explicitly provide ratings for each aspect making automated means unnecessary.2 Aspect identification has also been thoroughly studied (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Titov and McDonald, 2008), but again, ontologies and users often provide this information negating the need for automation.

The multi-aspect sentiment (MAS) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), which is extended from the multi-grain latent Dirichlet allocation (MG-LDA) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008b), allows sentiment text aggregation for sentiment summary of each rating aspect extracted from MG-LDA. $$$$$ The last factor quantifies the influence of the assignment of the word (d, i) on the probability of the sentiment ratings.

Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ It does not take many chain iterations to discover initial topics.
Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ Parallel to this study Branavan et al. (2008) also showed that joint models of text and user annotations benefit extractive summarization.
Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ Thus, if we model the prediction of aspect ratings jointly with the construction of explicitly associated topics, then such a model should benefit from both higher quality topics and a direct assignment from topics to aspects.

In contrast, MLSLDA draws on techniques that view sentiment as a regression problem based on the topics used in a document, as in supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) or in finer-grained parts of a document (Titov and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ The proposed approach is general and can be used for segmentation in other applications where sequential data is accompanied with correlated signals.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis summarizes sentiments with diverse attributes, so that customers may have to look more closely into analyzed sentiments (Titov and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ We demonstrated that the model indeed discovers corresponding coherent topics and achieves accuracy in sentence labeling comparable to a standard supervised model.

There have been various extensions to multi-grain (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), labeled (Ramage et al, 2009), partially-labeled (Ramage et al, 2011), constrained (Andrzejewski et al, 2009) models, etc. $$$$$ In this paper we presented a joint model of text and aspect ratings for extracting text to be displayed in sentiment summaries.

Titov and McDonald (2008b) proposed a joint model of text and aspect ratings which utilizes a modified LDA topic model to build topics that are representative of ratable aspects, and builds a set of sentiment predictors. $$$$$ Following Titov and McDonald (2008) we use a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm that was derived for the MG-LDA model based on the Gibbs sampling method proposed for LDA in (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
