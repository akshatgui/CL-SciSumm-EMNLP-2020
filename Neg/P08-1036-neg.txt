 $$$$$ MAS and sLDA are similar in that both use sentiment predictions as an observed signal that is predicted by the model.
 $$$$$ Our model achieves high accuracy, without any explicitly labeled data except the user provided opinion ratings.
 $$$$$ In this paper we presented a joint model of text and aspect ratings for extracting text to be displayed in sentiment summaries.

However, these two models either require post processing to calculate the positive/negative coverage in a document for polarity identification (Mei et al, 2007) or require some kind of supervised setting in which review text should contain ratings for aspects of interest (Titov and McDonald, 2008a). $$$$$ The second problem is sentiment classification.

The multi-aspect sentiment (MAS) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), which is extended from the multi-grain latent Dirichlet allocation (MG-LDA) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008b), allows sentiment text aggregation for sentiment summary of each rating aspect extracted from MG-LDA. $$$$$ However, these labels are often present in the data already, which opens another interesting line of research: designing models leveraging these labelings to improve a wide variety of applications.
The multi-aspect sentiment (MAS) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), which is extended from the multi-grain latent Dirichlet allocation (MG-LDA) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008b), allows sentiment text aggregation for sentiment summary of each rating aspect extracted from MG-LDA. $$$$$ Our model differs from theirs in many respects: Mei et al. only model sentiment predictions for the entire document and not on the aspect level; They treat sentiment predictions as unobserved variables, whereas we treat them as observed signals that help to guide the creation of topics; They model co-occurrences solely on the document level, whereas our model is based on MG-LDA and models both local and global contexts.
The multi-aspect sentiment (MAS) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), which is extended from the multi-grain latent Dirichlet allocation (MG-LDA) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008b), allows sentiment text aggregation for sentiment summary of each rating aspect extracted from MG-LDA. $$$$$ Sentiment classification is a well studied problem (Wiebe, 2000; Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002) and in many domains users explicitly provide ratings for each aspect making automated means unnecessary.2 Aspect identification has also been thoroughly studied (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Gamon et al., 2005; Titov and McDonald, 2008), but again, ontologies and users often provide this information negating the need for automation.

Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ In this paper we presented a joint model of text and aspect ratings for extracting text to be displayed in sentiment summaries.
Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ Top words for resulting topics are presented in Table 2.
Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ The model uses aspect ratings to discover the corresponding topics and can thus extract fragments of text discussing these aspects without the need of annotated data.

In contrast, MLSLDA draws on techniques that view sentiment as a regression problem based on the topics used in a document, as in supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) or in finer-grained parts of a document (Titov and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ In this paper we presented a joint model of text and aspect ratings for extracting text to be displayed in sentiment summaries.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis summarizes sentiments with diverse attributes, so that customers may have to look more closely into analyzed sentiments (Titov and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ A closely related model to ours is that of Mei et al. (2007) which performs joint topic and sentiment modeling of collections.
Aspect-based sentiment analysis summarizes sentiments with diverse attributes, so that customers may have to look more closely into analyzed sentiments (Titov and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ The primary area of future work is to incorporate the model into an end-to-end sentiment summarization system in order to evaluate it at that level.

There have been various extensions to multi-grain (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), labeled (Ramage et al, 2009), partially-labeled (Ramage et al, 2011), constrained (Andrzejewski et al, 2009) models, etc. $$$$$ However, (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) demonstrated that an efficient collapsed Gibbs sampler can be constructed, where only assignments z need to be sampled, whereas the dependency on distributions θ and ϕ can be integrated out analytically.

Titov and McDonald (2008b) proposed a joint model of text and aspect ratings which utilizes a modified LDA topic model to build topics that are representative of ratable aspects, and builds a set of sentiment predictors. $$$$$ Text excerpts are usually extracted through string matching (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), sentence clustering (Gamon et al., 2005), or through topic models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008).
