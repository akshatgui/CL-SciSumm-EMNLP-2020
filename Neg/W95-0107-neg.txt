NP chunks in the shared task data are BaseNPs, which are non-recursive NPs, a definition first proposed by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995). $$$$$ 1, transformation-based learning starts with a supervised training corpus that specifies the correct values for some linguistic feature of interest, a baseline heuristic for predicting initial values for that feature, and a set of rule templates that determine a space of possible transformational rules.

Transformation-based learning (TBL) was originally introduced via the Brill part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1992) and has since been applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks, including binary phrase structure bracketing (Brill, 1993), PP-attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik, 1994), base NP chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), dialogue act tagging (Samuel et al1998), and named entity re cog nition (Black and Vasilakopoulos, 2002). $$$$$ Rules were then automatically learned that updated these chunk structure tags based on neighboring words and their part-of-speech and chunk tags.

Many approaches to identifying base noun phrases have been explored as part of chunking (Ramshawand Marcus, 1995), but determining sub-NP structure is rarely addressed. $$$$$ Note that this heuristic technique introduces some risk of missing the actual best rule in a pass, due to its being incorrectly disabled at the time.
