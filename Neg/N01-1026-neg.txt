(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) aim at pos tagging a target language corpus using English pos tags as well as estimation of lexical priors. $$$$$ Even in English, with relatively high P(POSIw) ambiguity, only 0.37% of the tokens in the Brown Corpus are not covered by a word type's two most frequent core tags, and in French the percentage drops to 0.03%.

This can be seen as a rough approximation of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001). $$$$$ The major reason for estimating the lexical priors and tag sequence model separately is that a tag sequence bigram (or even trigram) model has far fewer parameters than the lexical prior model and thus can be estimated on a very conservatively chosen set of filtered, high confidence alignment data.
This can be seen as a rough approximation of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001). $$$$$ 1995.
This can be seen as a rough approximation of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001). $$$$$ Thus we employ an aggressive re-estimation in favor of this bias, where for t(i) = the ith most frequent tag for w: giving the large majority of the new probability mass to the single highest frequency core tag.
This can be seen as a rough approximation of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001). $$$$$ The first is the often very poor accuracy of word alignments, due both to the current limitations of word-alignment algorithms, and also to the often weak or incomplete inherent match between the two sides of a bilingual corpus.
