Bridging anaphora, as in (2a) above, have received much attention, see e.g. Asher and Lascarides (1998) or Poesio and Vieira (1998). $$$$$ This study raises the issue of how feasible it is to annotate corpora for anaphoric information.
Bridging anaphora, as in (2a) above, have received much attention, see e.g. Asher and Lascarides (1998) or Poesio and Vieira (1998). $$$$$ Attempts at making this intuition more precise include Christophersen's (1939) familiarity theory, Strawson's (1950) presuppositional theory of definite descriptions, Hawkins's (1978) location theory and its revision, Clark and Marshall's (1981) theory of definite reference and mutual knowledge, as well as more formal proposals such as Heim (1982).

Associative anaphora (e.g., Poesio and Vieira, 1998) and indirect anaphora (e.g., Murata and Nagao, 2000) are virtually the same phenomena that this paper is concerned with. $$$$$ We measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text.

A serious problem when working with bridging reference sis the fact that subjects, when asked for judgments about bridging references in general, have a great deal of difficulty in agreeing on which expressions in the corpus are bridging references, and what their anchors are (Poesio and Vieira, 1998). $$$$$ Third, going from a syntactic to a semantic definition of anaphoric definite description resulted in worse agreement both for coreferential and for bridging references: looking at the per-class figures, one can see that we went from a per-class agreement on anaphoric definite descriptions in Experiment 1 of 88% to a per-class agreement on coreferential definites of 86% in Experiment 2; and the per-class agreement for associative definite descriptions of 59% went down rather dramatically to a per-class agreement of 31% on bridging descriptions.

Poesio and Vieira (1998) found that of the 1,400 definite descriptions in their corpus, only about 50% were subsequent mention or bridging references, whereas 50% were first mentions. $$$$$ On the positive side, we have two observations: our subjects did reasonably well at distinguishing firÂ§t-mention from subsequent-mention antecedents, and at identifying the antecedent of a subsequent-mention definite description.

One of our aims was to continue the work on bridging references annotation and interpretation in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), which showed that marking up bridging references is quite hard. $$$$$ Our subjects were asked to classify the definite descriptions found in a corpus of natural language texts according to classification schemes that we developed starting from the taxonomies proposed by Hawkins (1978) and Prince (1981, 1992), but which took into account our intention of having naive speakers perform the classification.
