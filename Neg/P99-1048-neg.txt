Bean and Riloff (1999) developed a system for identifying discourse-new DDs that incorporates, in addition to syntax-based heuristics aimed at recognizing predicative and established DDs using post modification heuristics similar to those used by Vieira and Poesio, additional techniques for mining from corpora unfamiliar DDs including proper names, larger situation, and semantically functional. $$$$$ All of these methods produced a substantial gain in recall at some cost in precision.
