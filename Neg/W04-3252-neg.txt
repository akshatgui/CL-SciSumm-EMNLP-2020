Earlier experiments with graph-based ranking algorithms for text summarization, as previously reported in (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and (Erkanand Radev, 2004), were either limited to single document English summarization, or they were applied to English multi-document summarization, but in conjunction with other extractive summarization techniques that did not allow for a clear evaluation of the impact of the graph algorithms alone. $$$$$ An important aspect of TextRank is that it does not require deep linguistic knowledge, nor domain or language specific annotated corpora, which makes it highly portable to other domains, genres, or languages.

 $$$$$ Our system consists of the TextRank approach described in Section 3.1, with a co-occurrence windowsize set to two, three, five, or ten words.

 $$$$$ In this paper, we introduced TextRank – a graphbased ranking model for text processing, and show how it can be successfully used for natural language applications.
 $$$$$ For instance, in the keyphrase extraction application, co-occurring words recommend each other as important, and it is the common context that enables the identification of connections between words in text.

 $$$$$ Arguably, these algorithms can be singled out as key elements of the paradigm-shift triggered in the field of Web search technology, by providing a Web page ranking mechanism that relies on the collective knowledge of Web architects rather than individual content analysis of Web pages.
 $$$$$ Notice that the size of the text is not a limitation imposed by our system, and similar results are expected with TextRank applied on full-texts.
 $$$$$ The other TextRank application that we investigate consists of sentence extraction for automatic summarization.
 $$$$$ Applying a similar line of thinking to lexical or semantic graphs extracted from natural language documents, results in a graph-based ranking model that can be applied to a variety of natural language processing applications, where knowledge drawn from an entire text is used in making local ranking/selection decisions.

Text Rank (TR) This is a graph-based sum mariser method (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) where each word is a vertex. $$$$$ A larger window does not seem to help – on the contrary, the larger the window, the lower the precision, probably explained by the fact that a relation between words that are further apart is not strong enough to define a connection in the text graph.

PageRank score $$$$$ An important aspect of TextRank is that it does not require deep linguistic knowledge, nor domain or language specific annotated corpora, which makes it highly portable to other domains, genres, or languages.
PageRank score $$$$$ In this paper, we introduce TextRank – a graph-based ranking model for text processing, and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications.
PageRank score $$$$$ Intuitively, TextRank works well because it does not only rely on the local context of a text unit (vertex), but rather it takes into account information recursively drawn from the entire text (graph).

Note, by the way, that although our graphs are non-weighted and directed, like a graph of web pages and hyper links (and unlike the text graphs in Mihalcea and Tarau (2004), for example), several pairs of nodes may be connected by multiple edges, making a transition between them more probable. $$$$$ Figure 1 plots the convergence curves for a randomly generated graph with 250 vertices and 250 edges, for a convergence threshold of 0.0001.

As an example of an unsupervised keyphrase extraction approach, the graph-based ranking (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) regards key phrase extraction as a ranking task, where a document is represented by a term graph based on term relatedness, and then a graph-based ranking algorithm is used to assign importance scores to each term. $$$$$ These features are extracted from both training and test data for all “candidate” keywords, where a candidate keyword can be: Ngrams (unigrams, bigrams, or trigrams extracted from the abstracts), NP-chunks (noun phrases), patterns (a set of part of speech patterns detected from the keywords attached to the training abstracts).

Existing methods usually use term co occurrences within a specified window size in the given document as an approximation of term relatedness (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). $$$$$ In the context of Web surfing, it is unusual for a page to include multiple or partial links to another page, and hence the original PageRank definition for graph-based ranking is assuming unweighted graphs.
