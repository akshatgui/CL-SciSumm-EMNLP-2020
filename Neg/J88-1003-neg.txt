The algorithm is essentially the same as [DeRose, 1988]. $$$$$ The tag set used is very similar, but somewhat larger, at about 130 tags.

 $$$$$ Specifically, until the categories of individual words have been established, it is difficult to construct a unique and accurate syntactic structure.
 $$$$$ A natural relationship exists between the size of a dictionary, and the percentage of words in an average text which it accounts for.
 $$$$$ But a more detailed examination of the Pascal code for CLAWS revealed that CLAWS has a more complex definition of &quot;most probable sequence&quot; than one might expect.
 $$$$$ . can be associated with a marker @ or %; @ indicates that the tag is infrequently the correct tag for the associated word(s) (less than 1 in 10 occasions), % indicates that it is highly improbable.

This is well-described in for example (DeRose 1988). $$$$$ This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence of particular tags.

 $$$$$ The tagset is larger than TAGGIT's, though smaller than CLAWS', containing 97 tags.
 $$$$$ They may represent lexical items of different categories, depending upon their syntactic and semantic context.
 $$$$$ Blackwell comments that &quot;it was difficult to know where to draw the line in defining what constituted an idiom, and some such decisions seemed to have been influenced by semantic factors.

As we said at the outset, we don't necessarily believe HunPos to be in any way better than TnT, and certainly the main ideas have been pioneered by DeRose (1988), Church (1988), and others long before this generation of HMM work. $$$$$ An innovative method (called &quot;CLAWS&quot;) was recently developed by those working with the Lancaster â€”Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English.

We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988) or DeRose (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to/in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to/to. $$$$$ The more complex definition applied by using the sum of all paths at of the network, is not used.

Kallgren (1996) gives a more covering description of how XPOST is used on the Swedish material and also sketches the major differences between this algorithm and some others used for tagging, such as PARTS (Church 1988) and VOLSUNGA (DeRose 1988). $$$$$ The dictionary used is derived from the tagged Brown Corpus, rather than from the untagged.
