The algorithm is essentially the same as [DeRose, 1988]. $$$$$ For example, in deciding whether to consider the word &quot;time&quot; to be a noun or a verb, environments such as a preceding article or proper noun, or a following verb or pronoun, were the sole criteria.
The algorithm is essentially the same as [DeRose, 1988]. $$$$$ This algorithm operates entirely from left to right, and has no inherent limit upon the number of consecutive ambiguities which may be processed.

 $$$$$ Third, and perhaps most significant, it requires non-polynomially large time and space.
 $$$$$ The accuracy and speed of VOLSUNGA make it suitable for use in pre-processing natural language input to parsers and other language understanding systems.
 $$$$$ Therefore, a method for locally disambiguating lexical items has been developed.

This is well-described in for example (DeRose 1988). $$$$$ The total token count differs from Table 4 due to inclusion of non-lexical tokens, such as punctuation.
This is well-described in for example (DeRose 1988). $$$$$ On the other hand, the Corpus is comprehensive enough so that use of other input text is unlikely to introduce statistically significant changes in the program's performance.
This is well-described in for example (DeRose 1988). $$$$$ An innovative method (called &quot;CLAWS&quot;) was recently developed by those working with the Lancaster —Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English.

 $$$$$ Another advantage of VOLSUNGA is that it requires little inherent linguistic knowledge.
 $$$$$ The ambiguities contained within a span of ambiguous words define a precise number of complete sets of mappings from words to individual tags.
 $$$$$ Better, one can assign only those tags with a non-minimal probability of being adjacent to the possible tags of neighboring words.
 $$$$$ A complete table showing the relationship appears in Kucera and Francis (1967) pp.

As we said at the outset, we don't necessarily believe HunPos to be in any way better than TnT, and certainly the main ideas have been pioneered by DeRose (1988), Church (1988), and others long before this generation of HMM work. $$$$$ First, the optimal path is defined to be the one whose component collocations multiply out to the highest probability.

We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988) or DeRose (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to/in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to/to. $$$$$ Their techniques, accuracies, and efficiencies are analyzed.

Kallgren (1996) gives a more covering description of how XPOST is used on the Swedish material and also sketches the major differences between this algorithm and some others used for tagging, such as PARTS (Church 1988) and VOLSUNGA (DeRose 1988). $$$$$ More recently, however, work on the LOB Corpus of British English led to a more systematic algorithm based upon combinatorial statistics.

The latter approach was pioneered by Stolz et al (1965) and Bahl and Mercer (1976), and became widely known through the work of e.g. Church (1988) and DeRose (1988). $$$$$ This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence of particular tags.

The latter approach was pioneered by Stolz et al (1965) and Bahl and Mercer (1976), and became widely known through the work of e.g. Church (1988) and DeRose (1988). $$$$$ This is especially true because many of the unknown words would be (a) capitalized proper names, for which tag assignment is trivial modulo a small percentage at sentence boundaries, or (b) regular formations from existing words, which are readily identified by suffixes.
