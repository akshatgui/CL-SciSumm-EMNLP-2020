For the computation of related terms and synonyms, Ruge (1995), Landauer and Dumais (1997), and Fung and McKeown (1997) used the cosine measure, whereas Grefenstette (1994, p. 48) used a weighted Jaccard measure. $$$$$ Universal said its 15 3/4% debentures due Dec sold $75 million of 6% debentures priced at par and due Sept sold $40 million of 6 1/4% convertible debentures priced at par and due March 15 GTE offered a $250 million issue of 8 1/2% debentures due in 30 years $250 million of notes due 1997 and $250 million of debentures due 2017 sold $300 million of 7 1/2% convertible debentures due 2012 at par said it agreed to issue $125 million Canadian in convertible debentures senior subordinated debentures was offered through Drexel said it completed the redemption of all $16 million of its 9% subordinated debentures due 2003 Moody's assigned a Baa-3 rating to a proposed $100 million convertible subordinated debenture it and its 12 1/2% senior subordinated debentures at par $20 million of convertible debentures due June 1 issues of $110 million of senior notes due 1997 and $115 million of convertible debentures due said it reached an agreement with holders of $30 million of its convertible subordinated debentui downgraded the subordinated debentures of Bank of Montreal common shares and $35 million of convertible debentures due 2012 $35 million of convertible debentures due May 15 financed with $450 million of new Western Union senior secured debentures to be placed by Dre Commission to issue as much as $125 million of 30-year debentures packaged with common stoc to redeem its entire $55 million face amount of 8 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures dul Figure 1 shows that: We use online dictionaries to provide the it seed word lists.
For the computation of related terms and synonyms, Ruge (1995), Landauer and Dumais (1997), and Fung and McKeown (1997) used the cosine measure, whereas Grefenstette (1994, p. 48) used a weighted Jaccard measure. $$$$$ There are many metrics we can use to measure the closeness of two WoRMs.
For the computation of related terms and synonyms, Ruge (1995), Landauer and Dumais (1997), and Fung and McKeown (1997) used the cosine measure, whereas Grefenstette (1994, p. 48) used a weighted Jaccard measure. $$$$$ Furthermore, using such an English/English test set, the output can be evaluated automaticallyâ€”a translated pair is considered correct if they are identical English words.

(Fung and McKeown 1997, Kikui 1999, Zhao and Vogel 2002) extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from such corpora. $$$$$ Such seed words serve as the textual anchor points in non-parallel corpora.
(Fung and McKeown 1997, Kikui 1999, Zhao and Vogel 2002) extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from such corpora. $$$$$ In this case, the chances for co-occurrence between such seed words and all new words are very high, close to one.
(Fung and McKeown 1997, Kikui 1999, Zhao and Vogel 2002) extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from such corpora. $$$$$ This non-parallel corpus has minimal content and style differences.
(Fung and McKeown 1997, Kikui 1999, Zhao and Vogel 2002) extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from such corpora. $$$$$ While we should make use of any existing parallel corpora as lexical translation resources, we should not ignore the even larger amount of monolingual text.

In Fung and McKeown (1997), a translation model applied to a pair of unrelated languages (English/Japanese) with a random selection of test words, many of them multi-word terms, gives a precision around 30% when only the top candidate is proposed. $$$$$ The English Wall Street Journal non-parallel corpus gives us an easier test set on which to start.
In Fung and McKeown (1997), a translation model applied to a pair of unrelated languages (English/Japanese) with a random selection of test words, many of them multi-word terms, gives a precision around 30% when only the top candidate is proposed. $$$$$ While this precision is lower than that achieved with parallel corpora, we show that top 20 candidate output from our algorithm allows translators to increase their accuracy by 50.9%.
In Fung and McKeown (1997), a translation model applied to a pair of unrelated languages (English/Japanese) with a random selection of test words, many of them multi-word terms, gives a precision around 30% when only the top candidate is proposed. $$$$$ Furthermore, the frequent nature of the seed words led to our choice of the Euclidean Distance, instead of the Cosine Measure.

For example, in Rapp (1995), Fung and McKeown (1997), Morin et. al. $$$$$ Segments are either sentences, paragraphs, or string groups delimited by anchor points: where a = number of segments where both words occur number of segments where only w3 occur c = number of segments where only wt occur d = number of segments where neither words occur All correlation measures use the above likelihood scores in different formulations.
For example, in Rapp (1995), Fung and McKeown (1997), Morin et. al. $$$$$ Their output is in SET A.
For example, in Rapp (1995), Fung and McKeown (1997), Morin et. al. $$$$$ Since the Nikkei is encoded in two-byte Japanese character sets, the latter is equivalent to about 60M bytes of data in English.
For example, in Rapp (1995), Fung and McKeown (1997), Morin et. al. $$$$$ Online dictionary entries are used as seed words to generate Word Relation Matrices for the unknown words according to correlation measures.
