Since sentiment-bearing words in English have different degree of centrality to the category of sentiment, we have constructed a measure of word centrality to the category of positive or negative sentiment described in our earlier work (Andreevskaiaand Bergler, 2006a). $$$$$ Wehave shown how significantly the system re sults vary, depending on the composition of the seed list.Second, due to the high cost of manual an notation and other practical considerations, most bootstrapping and other NLP systems are evaluated on relatively small manually annotated gold standards developed for agiven semantic category.

 $$$$$ This paper contributes to the development of NLP and semantic tagging systems in several respects.
 $$$$$ Since many of the clearly sentiment-laden adjectives that form the core of the category of sentiment were identified by STEP in multiple runs and had, therefore, multiple duplicates in thelist that were counted as one entry in the com bined list, the collapsing procedure resulted in a lower-accuracy (66.5% - when GI-H4 neutralswere included) but much larger list of English adjectives marked as positive (n = 3, 908) or neg ative (n = 3, 905).
 $$$$$ In this paper we approach the category of sentiment as one of such fuzzy categories wheresome words ? such as good, bad ? are very central, prototypical members, while other, less central words may be interpreted differently by differ ent people.
 $$$$$ We did 58 STEP runs on unique non-intersecting seed lists drawn from manually annotated list ofpositive and negative adjectives and evaluated the results against other manually annotated lists.

Moreover, Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) show that the performance of automatic annotation of subjectivity at the word level can be hurt by the presence of subjectivity-ambiguous words in the training sets they use. $$$$$ Since the values of the Net Overlap Score may vary depending on the number of runs used inthe experiment, such mapping eliminates the vari ability in the score values introduced with changesin the number of runs performed.

Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al, 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al, 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a). $$$$$ The implied assumption is that such a gold standard represents a random sample drawn from the pop ulation of all category members and hence, system performance observed on this goldstandard can be projected to the whole se mantic category.

Non-neutral adjectives were extracted from WordNet and assigned fuzzy sentiment category membership/centrality scores and tags in Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006). $$$$$ These strata, derived from Net Overlap scores, reflect the degree of centrality of a given word to the semantic category, and, thus, provide greater assurance that system performance on other words with the same Net Overlap Score will be similar to the performance observed on the intersection of system results with the gold standard.?
