Brown, Lai and Mercer (Brown et al, 1991) used word count as the sentence length, whereas Gale and Church (Gale and Church, 1991) used character count. $$$$$ Elaborating this intuitively appealing insight, researchers at Xerox and at ISSCO [Kay, 1991, Catizone et al., 1989] have developed alignment algorithms that pair sentences according to the words that they contain.

Brown, Lai and Mercer (Brown et al, 1991) used word count as the sentence length, whereas Gale and Church (Gale and Church, 1991) used character count. $$$$$ Together, these two random processes form a hidden Markov model [Baum, 1972] for the generation of aligned pairs of corpora.

Using this search method meant that no prior segmentation of the corpora was needed (Moore, 2002), either in terms of aligned paragraphs (Gale and Church, 1991), or some aligned sentences as anchors (Brown et al, 1991). $$$$$ In addition to certain anchor points that are available in our data, the only information about the sentences that we use for calculating alignments is the number of tokens that they contain.
