However, it has been observed that ratings for different aspects can be correlated (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), e.g., very negative opinion about room cleanliness is likely to result not only in a low rating for the aspect rooms, but also is very predictive of low ratings for the aspects service and dining. $$$$$ Their model stores a weight vector w E R' and a vector of increasing boundaries b0 = −00 < b1 < ... < bk−1 < bk = 00 which divide the real line into k segments, one for each possible rank.

In multi-aspect rating (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007) one finds several distinct aspects such as food or service in a restaurant and then rates them on a fixed linear scale such as 1-5 stars, where all aspects could obtain just 1 star or all aspects could obtain 5 stars independently. $$$$$ Our model significantly outperforms individual ranking models as well as a stateof-the-art joint ranking model.

 $$$$$ To cover 90% of occurrences in the training set, 227 rank sets are required.
 $$$$$ Instead of training a separate model for each user, Basilico and Hofmann train a joint ranking model which shares a set of boundaries across all users.

 $$$$$ The model is trained with the Perceptron Ranking algorithm (or “PRank algorithm”), which reacts to incorrect predictions on the training set by updating the weight and boundary vectors.
 $$$$$ Note that w · x1 < b and w · x2 > b together imply that w3 < 0, whereas w · x3 > b and w · x4 < b together imply that w3 > 0.
 $$$$$ Sentiment Classification Traditionally, categorization of opinion texts has been cast as a binary classification task (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Dave et al., 2003).
 $$$$$ The addition of an agreement model, however, can easily yield a perfect ranking.
