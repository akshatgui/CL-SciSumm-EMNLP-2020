Similarly, Snyder and Barzilay (2007) decompose an opinion across several dimensions and capture the sentiment across each dimension. $$$$$ We formulate this task as a multiple aspect ranking problem, where the goal is to produce a set of numerical scores, one for each aspect.

However, it has been observed that ratings for different aspects can be correlated (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), e.g., very negative opinion about room cleanliness is likely to result not only in a low rating for the aspect rooms, but also is very predictive of low ratings for the aspects service and dining. $$$$$ Thus an agreementbased approach is natural and relevant.

Snyder and Barzilay (2007) combine an agreement model based on contrastive RST relations with a local aspect (or target) model to make a more informed overall decision for sentiment classification. $$$$$ The Good Grief decoding algorithm predicts a set of ranks – one for each aspect – which maximally satisfy the preferences of the individual rankers and the agreement model.

Also, it would be interesting to take a closer look at the interactions between aspect and sentiment, especially at a multiple-sentence level (see Snyder and Barzilay 2007). $$$$$ The strength of our algorithm lies in its ability to guide the prediction of individual rankers using rhetorical relations between aspects such as agreement and contrast.
