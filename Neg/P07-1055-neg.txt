McDonald et al (2007) also dealt with sentiment analysis, via the global joint-structural approach. $$$$$ All models use the same basic predicate space: unigram, bigram, trigram conjoined with part-of-speech, plus back-offs of these (see Section 2.1.2 for more).

More recently, McDonald et al (2007) have investigated a model for jointly performing sentence and document-level sentiment analysis, allowing the relationship between the two tasks to be captured and exploited. $$$$$ 438 scribed a simple model for sentence-document analysis and showed that inference in it is tractable.

The data used in our initial English-only experiments were a set of 554 consumer reviews described in (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ The top subjective sentences are cascaded approach would also be insufficient.

Finally, solutions that attempt to handle the error propagation problem have done so by explicitly optimizing for the best combination of document and sentence-level classification accuracy (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ In this paper we investigate a structured model for jointly classifying the sentiment of text at varying levels of granularity.

While our approach uses a similar hierarchy, McDonald et al (2007) is concerned with recovering the labels at all levels, whereas in this work we are interested in using latent document content structure as a means to benefit task predictions. $$$$$ Results for each model are given in the first four rows of Table 2.

Subsequently, many other studies make efforts to improve the performance of machine learning-based classifiers by various means, such as using subjectivity summarization (Pang and Lee, 2004), seeking new superior textual features (Riloff et al, 2006), and employing document subcomponent information (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ Inference in the model is based on standard sequence classification techniques using constrained Viterbi to ensure consistent solutions.
