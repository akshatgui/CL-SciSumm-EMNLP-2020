Finally, solutions that attempt to handle the error propagation problem have done so by explicitly optimizing for the best combination of document and sentence-level classification accuracy (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ For example, CRFs define the probability over the labels conditioned on the input using the property that the joint probability distribution over the labels factors over clique potentials in undirected graphical models (Lafferty et al., 2001).
