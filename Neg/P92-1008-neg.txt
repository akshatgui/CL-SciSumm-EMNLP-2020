Results of testing the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher, are reported in (Bear et al, 1992): 309 of 406 utterance containing nontrivial  repairs in their 10,718 utterance corpus were correctly identified, while 191 fluent utterances were incorrectly identified as containing repairs. $$$$$ The corpus contains digitized waveforms and transcriptions of a large number of sessions in which subjects made air travel plans using a computer.

Bear et al (1992) also speculate that acoustic information might be used to filter out false positives for candidates matching two of their lexical patterns - repetitions of single words and cases of single inserted words - but do not report such experimentation. $$$$$ Table 1 shows examples of the notation used, which is described fully in Bear et al. (1992).

Bear et al (1992) also speculate that acoustic information might be used to filter out false positives for candidates matching two of their lexical patterns - repetitions of single words and cases of single inserted words - but do not report such experimentation. $$$$$ Relevant to the current paper is the fact that although the speech was spontaneous, it was somewhat planned (subjects pressed a button to begin speaking to the system) and the transcribers who produced lexical transcriptions of the sessions were instructed to mark words they inferred were verbally deleted by the speaker with special symbols.

As noted in (Bear et al, 1992), knowledge about the location of word fragments would be an invaluable cue to both detection and correction of disfluencies. $$$$$ We would like to thank Patti Price for her helpful comments on earlier drafts, as well as for her participation in the development of the notational system used.

For annotating speech repairs, we have extended the scheme proposed by Bear et al (1992) so that it better deals with overlapping and ambiguous repairs. $$$$$ A third way in which acoustic knowledge can assist in detecting and correcting repairs is in the recognition of word fragments.

Bear et al (1992) explored pattern matching, parsing and acoustic cues and concluded that multiple sources of information would be needed to detect edit dis fluencies. $$$$$ We have categorized these disfluencies as to type and frequency, and are investigating methods for their automatic detection and correction.

The SRI group (Bear et al, 1992) employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs. $$$$$ If parsing did not succeed, then pattern matching was used to detect possible repairs, and the edits associated with the repairs were made.

(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration. $$$$$ It is likely that recognition of fragments of the first type, in which there is abrupt cessation of speech during a vowel, can be aided by looking for heavy glottalization at the end of the fragment.

This approach is similar to an experiment in (Bear et al, 1992) except that Bear et al were more interested in reducing false alarms. $$$$$ Because so many repairs involve fragments, if fragments are not represented in the recognizer output, then information relevant to the processing of repairs is lost.
This approach is similar to an experiment in (Bear et al, 1992) except that Bear et al were more interested in reducing false alarms. $$$$$ In addition, certain cue words, such as &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;oops&quot; (marked with CR) as well as filled pauses (CF) are also labeled want fl- flights to boston. if they occur immediately before the site of a repair.
This approach is similar to an experiment in (Bear et al, 1992) except that Bear et al were more interested in reducing false alarms. $$$$$ In a portion of these cases, for example, &quot;leaving at <seven> <fif-> eight thirty,&quot; the presence of the fragment is an especially important cue because there is nothing (e.g., no matched words) to cause the pattern matcher to hypothesize the presence of a repair.

 $$$$$ The basic aspects of the notation include marking the interruption point, the extent of the repair, and relevant correspondences between words in the region.
 $$$$$ Preliminary results show that pattern matching is effective at detecting repairs without excessive overgeneration.
