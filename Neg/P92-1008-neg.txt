Results of testing the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher, are reported in (Bear et al, 1992) $$$$$ We categorized the length 1 and length 2 repairs according to their transcriptions.

Results of testing the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher, are reported in (Bear et al, 1992) $$$$$ We would also like to thank Robin Lickley for his feedback on the acoustics section, Elizabeth Wade for assistance with the statistics, and Mark Gawron for work on the Gemini grammar.

Bear et al (1992) also speculate that acoustic information might be used to filter out false positives for candidates matching two of their lexical patterns - repetitions of single words and cases of single inserted words - but do not report such experimentation. $$$$$ We use pattern matching to determine an initial set of possible repairs; we then apply information from syntactic, semantic, and acoustic analyses to distinguish actual repairs from false positives.
Bear et al (1992) also speculate that acoustic information might be used to filter out false positives for candidates matching two of their lexical patterns - repetitions of single words and cases of single inserted words - but do not report such experimentation. $$$$$ A third source of information that can be helpful in detecting repairs is acoustics.

As noted in (Bear et al, 1992), knowledge about the location of word fragments would be an invaluable cue to both detection and correction of disfluencies. $$$$$ We ran them two ways: once using syntactic constraints alone and again using both syntactic and semantic constraints.
As noted in (Bear et al, 1992), knowledge about the location of word fragments would be an invaluable cue to both detection and correction of disfluencies. $$$$$ So far we have used only phrases where the grammatical category of the matched word was either noun or name (proper noun).
As noted in (Bear et al, 1992), knowledge about the location of word fragments would be an invaluable cue to both detection and correction of disfluencies. $$$$$ Table 1 shows examples of the notation used, which is described fully in Bear et al. (1992).

For annotating speech repairs, we have extended the scheme proposed by Bear et al (1992) so that it better deals with overlapping and ambiguous repairs. $$$$$ In approximately 40% of the sentences containing fragments in our data, the fragment occurred at the right edge of a longer repair.

Bear et al (1992) explored pattern matching, parsing and acoustic cues and concluded that multiple sources of information would be needed to detect edit dis fluencies. $$$$$ The corpus contains digitized waveforms and transcriptions of a large number of sessions in which subjects made air travel plans using a computer.
Bear et al (1992) explored pattern matching, parsing and acoustic cues and concluded that multiple sources of information would be needed to detect edit dis fluencies. $$$$$ We found glottalization in 24 of the 25 vowel-final fragments in our data.
Bear et al (1992) explored pattern matching, parsing and acoustic cues and concluded that multiple sources of information would be needed to detect edit dis fluencies. $$$$$ First, the longer the matched string, the more likely the phrase was a repair.
Bear et al (1992) explored pattern matching, parsing and acoustic cues and concluded that multiple sources of information would be needed to detect edit dis fluencies. $$$$$ The criteria involve integration of knowledge from several sources: pattern matching, syntactic and semantic analysis, and acoustics.

The SRI group (Bear et al, 1992) employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs. $$$$$ It differs, however, in that we make no assumption about the existence of an explicit edit signal.

The SRI group (Bear et al, 1992) employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs. $$$$$ For this test we specified a list of possible phrase types (NP, VP, PP, N, Name) that count as a successful parse.
The SRI group (Bear et al, 1992) employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs. $$$$$ We have analyzed 607 sentences of spontaneous human-computer speech data containing repairs, drawn from a total corpus of 10,718 sentences.

(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration. $$$$$ The criteria involve integration of knowledge from several sources: pattern matching, syntactic and semantic analysis, and acoustics.
(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration. $$$$$ R indicates that the second of the two words was intended by the speaker to replace the first.

This approach is similar to an experiment in (Bear et al, 1992) except that Bear et al were more interested in reducing false alarms. $$$$$ In addition, certain cue words, such as &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;oops&quot; (marked with CR) as well as filled pauses (CF) are also labeled want fl- flights to boston. if they occur immediately before the site of a repair.
This approach is similar to an experiment in (Bear et al, 1992) except that Bear et al were more interested in reducing false alarms. $$$$$ While these numbers are quite promising, they may improve even more when information from syntax and semantics is combined with that from acoustics.

 $$$$$ This paper extends work reported in an earlier paper (Shriberg et al., 1992a).
 $$$$$ For simplicity, in this table we have counted fragments (which always occurred as the second deleted word) as whole words.
 $$$$$ For this experiment, the parser was using both syntax and semantics.
 $$$$$ Two trends emerge from these data.
