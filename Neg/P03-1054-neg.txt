 $$$$$ While he gives incomplete experimental results as to their efficacy, we can assume that these features were incorporated because of beneficial effects on parsing that were complementary to lexicalization.

Duringthe NER extraction, we also employ phrase analysis based on our phrase utility extraction method using Standford dependency parser ((Klein and Manning, 2003)). $$$$$ We do not want to argue that lexical selection is not a worthwhile component of a state-ofthe-art parser – certain attachments, at least, require it – though perhaps its necessity has been overstated.

We parsed each sentence using the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and used heuristics to identify cases where the main verb is transitive, where the subject is a nominalization (e.g. running), or whether the sentence is passive. $$$$$ For example, NNS tags occur under NP nodes (only 234 of 70855 do not, mostly mistakes).

As the grammar becomes sparser, there are limited opportunities for the lexical dependencies to correct the output of the PCFG grammar under the factored parsing model of Klein and Manning (2003b). $$$$$ It would therefore be natural to annotate the trees so as to confine unary productions to the contexts in which they are actually appropriate.
As the grammar becomes sparser, there are limited opportunities for the lexical dependencies to correct the output of the PCFG grammar under the factored parsing model of Klein and Manning (2003b). $$$$$ The concrete use of a grammar rule is to take two adjacent span-marked labels and combine them (for example NP[0,5] and VP[5,12] into S[0,12]).

We parsed the documents into typed dependencies with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ The result has other uses and advantages: an unlexicalized PCFG is easier to interpret, reason about, and improve than the more complex lexicalized models.

To obtain dependency structures, we apply the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) on the target side of the training material. $$$$$ Rather, we have shown ways to improve parsing, some easier than lexicalization, and others of which are orthogonal to it, and could presumably be used to benefit lexicalized parsers as well.
