Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ All of the facet level assignments are significantly better than a baseline of always choosing the most frequent level (Table 1). and the performance appears even better when one considers that the machines do not actually know what the most frequent level is.
Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ Parsing accuracy could be increased by taking genre into account (for example, certain object-less constructions occur only in recipes in English).
Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ People who go into a bookstore or library are not usually looking simply for information about a particular topic, but rather have requirements of genre as well: they are looking for scholarly articles about hypnotism, novels about the French Revolution, editorials about the supercollider, and so forth.

Like Kessler et al (1997) and Argamon et al (1998) after them, they exploit (partly) hand-crafted sets of features, which are specific to texts in English. $$$$$ S = sentences.

Apart from two notable exceptions, namely Kessler et al (1997) and Rehm (2006) whose implementations require extensive manual annotation (Kessler et al, 1997) or analysis (Rehm, 2006), genres are usually classified as single-label discrete entities, relying on the simplified assumption that a document can be assigned to only one genre. $$$$$ It will be recalled that in the LR models, the facets with more than two levels were computed by means of binary decision machines for each level, then choosing the level with the most positive score.

(Kessler et al, 1997) combine these views by saying that a genre should not be so broad that the texts belonging to it don't share any distinguishing properties. $$$$$ These cues are not much discussed in the traditional literature on genre. but have come to the fore in recent work (Biber, 1995; Karlgren and Cutting, 1994).

... we would probably not use the term "genre" to describe merely the class of texts that have the objective of persuading someone to do something, since that class which would include editorials, sermons, prayers, advertisements, and so forth has no distinguishing formal properties (Kessler et al, 1997, p. 33). $$$$$ The evaluation subcorpus was designed to have approximately equal numbers of all represented combinations of facet levels.

Kessler et al (1997) avoid structural markers since they require tagged or parsed text and replace them with character-level markers (e.g., punctuation mark counts) and derivative markers, i.e., ratios and variation measures derived from measures of lexical and character-level markers. $$$$$ We hope to show that the usefulness of retrieval tools can be dramatically improved if genre is one of the selection criteria that users can exploit.

Another straightforward method is the assumption that Latinate prefixes and suffixes are indicators of formality in English (Kessler et al, 1997), i.e. informal words will not have Latinate affixes such as -ation and intra-. $$$$$ This setup results in different quantitative compositions of training and evaluation set.
