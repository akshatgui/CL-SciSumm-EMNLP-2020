Agresti (1990) or Kessler et al (1997)). $$$$$ One important reason is that, up to now, the digitized corpora and collections which are the subject of much CL research have been for the most part generically homogeneous (i.e., collections of scientific abstracts or newspaper articles, encyclopedias, and so on), so that the problem of genre identification could be set aside.

Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ For the polytomous facets GENRE and BROW, we computed a predictor function independently for each level of each facet and chose the category with the highest prediction.
Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ Comparing LR with surface cues and LR with structural cues as input, we find that they yield about the same performance: averages of 77.0% (surface) vs. 77.5% (structural) for all variables and 78.4% (surface) vs. 78.9% (structural) for selected variables.
Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ All of the facet level assignments are significantly better than a baseline of always choosing the most frequent level (Table 1). and the performance appears even better when one considers that the machines do not actually know what the most frequent level is.

Like Kessler et al (1997) and Argamon et al (1998) after them, they exploit (partly) hand-crafted sets of features, which are specific to texts in English. $$$$$ This setup results in different quantitative compositions of training and evaluation set.

However, additional aspects of a document in uence its relevance, including, e.g., the evidential status of the material presented, and the attitudes expressed about the topic (Kessler et al, 1997). $$$$$ We ended up using 499 of the 802 texts in the Brown Corpus.

Apart from two notable exceptions, namely Kessler et al (1997) and Rehm (2006) whose implementations require extensive manual annotation (Kessler et al, 1997) or analysis (Rehm, 2006), genres are usually classified as single-label discrete entities, relying on the simplified assumption that a document can be assigned to only one genre. $$$$$ For binary decisions, the application of LR was straightforward.

We plan to investigate more types of document collections pairs, e.g., the document collections from different text genres (Kessler et al, 1997). $$$$$ We propose a theory of genres as of correlate with various surface cues, and argue that genre detection based on surface cues is as successful as detection based on deeper structural properties.

(Kessler et al, 1997) combine these views by saying that a genre should not be so broad that the texts belonging to it don't share any distinguishing properties. $$$$$ MIDDLE for BROW, and No for NARRATIVE.

... we would probably not use the term "genre" to describe merely the class of texts that have the objective of persuading someone to do something, since that class which would include editorials, sermons, prayers, advertisements, and so forth has no distinguishing formal properties (Kessler et al, 1997, p. 33). $$$$$ The experiments in this paper are based on 55 cues from the last three groups: lexical, characterlevel and derivative cues.

This is where the caveat from (Kessler et al, 1997) be comes relevant: A particular genre shouldn't betaken so broadly as to have no distinguishing features, nor so narrowly as to have no general applicability. $$$$$ These cues are not much discussed in the traditional literature on genre. but have come to the fore in recent work (Biber, 1995; Karlgren and Cutting, 1994).

Kessler et al (1997) avoid structural markers since they require tagged or parsed text and replace them with character-level markers (e.g., punctuation mark counts) and derivative markers, i.e., ratios and variation measures derived from measures of lexical and character-level markers. $$$$$ Our corpus of 499 texts was divided into a training subcorpus (402 texts) and an evaluation subcorpus (97).

Another straightforward method is the assumption that Latinate prefixes and suffixes are indicators of formality in English (Kessler et al, 1997), i.e. informal words will not have Latinate affixes such as -ation and intra-. $$$$$ Such features have not been used in previous work on genre recognition, but we believe they have an important role to play, being at once significant and very frequent.
