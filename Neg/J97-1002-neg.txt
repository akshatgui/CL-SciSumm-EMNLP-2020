 $$$$$ Often refusal takes the form of ignoring the initiation and simply initiating some other move.
 $$$$$ The coding described in this paper differs from all of these coding schemes in three important ways.

These strategies can be seen as transactions made up of conversational games (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ In addition, natural dialogue participants often fail to make clear to their partners what their goals are.
These strategies can be seen as transactions made up of conversational games (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ The coders were able to reproduce the most important aspects of the coding reliably, such as move segmentation, classifying moves as initiations or responses, and subclassifying initiation and response types.
These strategies can be seen as transactions made up of conversational games (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ In the Map Task, two participants have slightly different versions of a simple map with approximately fifteen landmarks on it.

Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly defined dialogue acts Initiations I and Acknowledgments A based on the top of the hierarchy given in Carletta et al (1997). $$$$$ The coding described in this paper differs from all of these coding schemes in three important ways.

This is an empirically very well-founded distinction $$$$$ However, it is also possible to make such refusals explicit; for instance, a participant could rebuff a question with &quot;No, let's talk about ... ,&quot; an initiation with &quot;What do you meanâ€”that won't work!&quot;, or an explanation about the location of a landmark with &quot;Is it?&quot; said with an appropriately unbelieving intonation.
This is an empirically very well-founded distinction $$$$$ RESPONSE PREPARATION Does the response contribute task/domain READY information, or does it only show evidence that communication has been successful?

As indicated in Table 9, the unanimous agreement of just 16.6% and 19.5% in the ad hoc and categorization tasks respectively is low $$$$$ The purpose of this paper is to introduce and describe the reliability of a scheme of dialogue coding distinctions that have been developed for use on the Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al. 1991).

To put Table 8 in perspective, note that expert human coders achieved= 0.83 on DA classification for MapTask, but also had available the speech source (Carletta et al, 1997). $$$$$ OVERVIEW transactions were too rare to be reliable or useful and should be dropped from future coding systems.

To put Table 8 in perspective, note that expert human coders achieved= 0.83 on DA classification for MapTask, but also had available the speech source (Carletta et al, 1997). $$$$$ The coding system has two components: (1) how route givers divide conveying the route into subtasks and what parts of the dialogue serve each of the subtasks, and (2) what actions the route follower takes and when.

We also compared the confusion matrix from (Carletta et al, 1997) with the confusion matrix we obtained for our best result on MapTask (FLSA using Game+ Speaker). $$$$$ Although technically the tree of coding distinctions allows for a CHECK or an ALIGN to take the form of a wh-question, this is unusual in English.
We also compared the confusion matrix from (Carletta et al, 1997) with the confusion matrix we obtained for our best result on MapTask (FLSA using Game+ Speaker). $$$$$ All of the coders interacted verbally with the coding developers, making it harder to say what they agree upon than if they had worked solely from written instructions.

The same type of structures is also used in the analysis of dialogues, e.g. (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ In addition, the move coded corpus has been used to train a program to spot the dialogue move category based on typical word patterns, in aid of speech recognition (Bird et al. 1995).
The same type of structures is also used in the analysis of dialogues, e.g. (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ These dialogue structure distinctions were developed within a larger &quot;vertical analysis&quot; of dialogue encompassing a range of phenomena, beginning with speech characteristics, and therefore are intended to be useful whenever an expression of dialogue structure is required.
The same type of structures is also used in the analysis of dialogues, e.g. (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ The replication involved four naive coders and the &quot;expert&quot; developer of the coding instructions.
The same type of structures is also used in the analysis of dialogues, e.g. (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ Second, although other coding schemes may distinguish many categories for utterances segmented according to the discourse goals they serve, by showing game and transaction structures this coding scheme attempts to classify dialogue structure at higher levels as well.

Another common agreement metric is the kappa coefficient which normalises token level accuracy by chance, e.g. Carletta et al (1997). $$$$$ They use these speech acts to derive statistical predictions about which speech act will come next within VERBMOBIL, a speech-to-speech dialogue translation system that operates on demand for limited stretches of dialogue.

Another common agreement metric is the kappa coefficient which normalises token level accuracy by chance, e.g. Carletta et al (1997). $$$$$ First, although the move categories are informed by computational models of dialogue, the categories themselves are more independent of the task than schemes devised with particular machine dialogue types in mind.

Other tagging schemes, such as the Maptask scheme (Carletta et al., 1997), are also too general for our purposes. $$$$$ Now many researchers are beginning to try to code large dialogue corpora for higher-level dialogue structure in the hope of giving their findings a firmer basis.
Other tagging schemes, such as the Maptask scheme (Carletta et al., 1997), are also too general for our purposes. $$$$$ Games can nest within each other if one game is initiated to serve the larger goal of a game that has already been initiated (for instance, if a question is on the floor but the hearer needs to ask for clarification before answering).

For dialog act labeling, we built models from our corpus and from the Maptask (Carletta et al, 1997). $$$$$ [where the query is asked very generally about a large stretch of dialogue, &quot;just in case] 3.1.5 The QUERY-YN Move.
For dialog act labeling, we built models from our corpus and from the Maptask (Carletta et al, 1997). $$$$$ Game analysis makes use of this regularity to differentiate between initiations, which set up a discourse expectation about what will follow, and responses, which fulfill those expectations.

This kind of multi-level assessment corresponds to that described and used in Carletta et al, (1997). $$$$$ It was funded by an Interdisciplinary Research Centre Grant from the Economic and Social Research Council (U.K.) to the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow and grant number G9111013 of the Joint Councils Initiative.
This kind of multi-level assessment corresponds to that described and used in Carletta et al, (1997). $$$$$ The move coding divides the dialogue up into segments corresponding to the different discourse goals of the participants and classifies the segments into 1 of 12 different categories, some of which initiate a discourse expectation and some of which respond to an existing expectation.
This kind of multi-level assessment corresponds to that described and used in Carletta et al, (1997). $$$$$ A QUERY-YN asks the partner any question that takes a yes or no answer and does not count as a CHECK or an ALIGN.

Many such models focus on other aspects of a dialog such as coordinated activities ,i.e. turn-taking and grounding, (Traum and Hinkelman, 1992) and regular patterns in the dialog (Carletta et al, 1997) rather than the domain-specific information communicated by participants. $$$$$ We would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their comments on the draft manuscript.

Note that we are interested in the process of designing a domain-specific tag set from the definitions of task, subtask, and concept provided by the framework, not in the process of using an existing tag set to annotate data (see for example (Carletta et al, 1997)). $$$$$ (If the information were elicited, the move would be a response, such as a reply to a question.)

Again, according to the work of Carletta et al (1997), a minimum kappa score of 0.67 is required to draw tentative conclusions. $$$$$ Games can nest within each other if one game is initiated to serve the larger goal of a game that has already been initiated (for instance, if a question is on the floor but the hearer needs to ask for clarification before answering).

This position was taken by other computational linguists as well (Carletta et al, 1997, p. 25). $$$$$ A conversational game is a set of utterances starting with an initiation and encompassing all utterances up until the purpose of the game has been either fulfilled (e.g., the requested information has been transferred) or abandoned.

This position was taken by other computational linguists as well (Carletta et al, 1997, p. 25). $$$$$ Finally, although the other coding schemes appear to have been devised primarily with one purpose in mind, this coding scheme is intended to represent dialogue structure generically so that it can be used in conjunction with codings of many other dialogue phenomena.
This position was taken by other computational linguists as well (Carletta et al, 1997, p. 25). $$$$$ RESPONSE PREPARATION Does the response contribute task/domain READY information, or does it only show evidence that communication has been successful?

For example, Carletta et al (1997) computed agreement on a coarse segmentation level that was constructed on the top of finer segments, by determining how well coders agreed on where the coarse segments started, and, for agreed starts, by computing how coders agreed on where coarse segments ended. $$$$$ RESPONSE PREPARATION Does the response contribute task/domain READY information, or does it only show evidence that communication has been successful?

Redo our experiments on other corpora, such as Map Task (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ Game and move coding are currently being used to study intonation both in oneword English utterances (Kowtko 1995) and in longer utterances across languages (Grice et al. 1995), the differences between audio-only, face-to-face, text-based, and video-mediated communication (Doherty-Sneddon et al., forthcoming; Newlands, Anderson, and Mullin 1996), and the characteristics of dialogue where one of the participants is a nonfluent Broca-type aphasic (Merrison, Anderson, and Doherty-Sneddon 1994).

The monologue side has been annotated with discourse relations, using an adaptation of the annotation guidelines of Carlson and Marcu (2001), whereas the dialogue side has been marked up with dialogue acts, using tags inspired by the schemes of Bunt (2000), Carletta et al. (1997) and Core and Allen (1997). $$$$$ Although transaction coding has some problems, the coding can be improved by correcting a few common confusions.
