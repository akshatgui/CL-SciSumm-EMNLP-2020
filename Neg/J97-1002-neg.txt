 $$$$$ Too many semantic distinctions make coding difficult.
 $$$$$ Authors JC and Al are responsible for developing the transaction coding scheme and for carrying out the reliability studies; all authors contributed to the development of the move and game coding schemes.
 $$$$$ Now many researchers are beginning to try to code large dialogue corpora for higher-level dialogue structure in the hope of giving their findings a firmer basis.

These strategies can be seen as transactions made up of conversational games (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ Transaction coding gives the subdialogue structure of complete task-oriented dialogues, with each transaction being built up of several dialogue games and corresponding to one step of the task.
These strategies can be seen as transactions made up of conversational games (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ First, although the move categories are informed by computational models of dialogue, the categories themselves are more independent of the task than schemes devised with particular machine dialogue types in mind.
These strategies can be seen as transactions made up of conversational games (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ Note that it would not be possible to define &quot;unit&quot; in the same way for use in kappa because then it would not be possible for the coders to agree on a nonboundary classification.

Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly defined dialogue acts Initiations I and Acknowledgments A based on the top of the hierarchy given in Carletta et al (1997). $$$$$ We would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their comments on the draft manuscript.

This is an empirically very well-founded distinction: the ICSI-MR group have provided some inter-annotator agreement figures (Carletta et al, 1997) for a very similar task and report a kappa of 0.79. $$$$$ The purpose of this paper is to introduce and describe the reliability of a scheme of dialogue coding distinctions that have been developed for use on the Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al. 1991).

As indicated in Table 9, the unanimous agreement of just 16.6% and 19.5% in the ad hoc and categorization tasks respectively is low: the agreement data has Kappa (Carletta et al 1997) of .38 for ad hoc and .29 for categorization 4. $$$$$ 3.1.6 The QUERY-W Move.

To put Table 8 in perspective, note that expert human coders achieved= 0.83 on DA classification for MapTask, but also had available the speech source (Carletta et al, 1997). $$$$$ Is the person who is transferring information asking a question in an attempt to get evidence that the transfer was successful, so they can move on?
To put Table 8 in perspective, note that expert human coders achieved= 0.83 on DA classification for MapTask, but also had available the speech source (Carletta et al, 1997). $$$$$ Subjective coding has been described for three different levels of task-oriented dialogue structure, called conversational moves, games, and transactions, and the reliability of all three kinds of coding discussed.

We also compared the confusion matrix from (Carletta et al, 1997) with the confusion matrix we obtained for our best result on MapTask (FLSA using Game+ Speaker). $$$$$ The coding described in this paper differs from all of these coding schemes in three important ways.
We also compared the confusion matrix from (Carletta et al, 1997) with the confusion matrix we obtained for our best result on MapTask (FLSA using Game+ Speaker). $$$$$ A conversational game is a set of utterances starting with an initiation and encompassing all utterances up until the purpose of the game has been either fulfilled (e.g., the requested information has been transferred) or abandoned.

The same type of structures is also used in the analysis of dialogues, e.g. (Carletta et al., 1997). $$$$$ The size and shape of transactions is largely dependent on the task.

Another common agreement metric is the kappa coefficient which normalises token level accuracy by chance, e.g. Carletta et al (1997). $$$$$ Is the utterance an initiation, response, or preparation?

Other tagging schemes, such as the Maptask scheme (Carletta et al., 1997), are also too general for our purposes. $$$$$ The purpose of this paper is to introduce and describe the reliability of a scheme of dialogue coding distinctions that have been developed for use on the Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al. 1991).
Other tagging schemes, such as the Maptask scheme (Carletta et al., 1997), are also too general for our purposes. $$$$$ The move coders reached K = .92 using word boundaries as units (N = 4,079 [the number of units], k = 4 [the number of coders]); pairwise percent agreement on locations where any coder had marked a move boundary was 89% (N = 796).

For dialog act labeling, we built models from our corpus and from the Maptask (Carletta et al, 1997). $$$$$ Note that the expert interacted minimally with the coders, and therefore differences were not due to training.

This kind of multi-level assessment corresponds to that described and used in Carletta et al, (1997). $$$$$ The game coding results come from the same study as the results for the expert move cross-coding results.

Many such models focus on other aspects of a dialog such as coordinated activities ,i.e. turn-taking and grounding, (Traum and Hinkelman, 1992) and regular patterns in the dialog (Carletta et al, 1997) rather than the domain-specific information communicated by participants. $$$$$ Describing a typical size may improve agreement, but might also weaken the influence of the real segmentation criteria.

Again, according to the work of Carletta et al (1997), a minimum kappa score of 0.67 is required to draw tentative conclusions. $$$$$ The second measure, similar to information retrieval metrics, is the actual agreement reached measuring pairwise over all locations where any coder marked a boundary.
Again, according to the work of Carletta et al (1997), a minimum kappa score of 0.67 is required to draw tentative conclusions. $$$$$ Calculating as described, coders reached promising but not entirely reassuring agreement on where games began (70%, N = 203).

For example, Carletta et al (1997) computed agreement on a coarse segmentation level that was constructed on the top of finer segments, by determining how well coders agreed on where the coarse segments started, and, for agreed starts, by computing how coders agreed on where coarse segments ended. $$$$$ We would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their comments on the draft manuscript.
