Sentence-level filter $$$$$ Another aspect of interest is the presence of long contiguous connected spans, which we define as pairs of bilingual substrings in which the words in one substring are connected only to words in the other substring.
Sentence-level filter $$$$$ Another problem is that the large majority of sentence pairs in the Cartesian product have low word overlap (i.e., few words that are translations of each other).
Sentence-level filter $$$$$ As can be seen, our automatically extracted corpora obtain better MT performance than out-of-domain parallel corpora of similar size.

The baseline uses only the length-based filtering and the coverage filtering without caching the coverage decisions (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005). $$$$$ Each query is thus run against fewer documents, so it becomes faster and has a better chance of getting the right documents at the top.
