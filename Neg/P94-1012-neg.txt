In byte-length ratio approaches, the presence of long stretches of blocks that have roughly similar lengths can be problematic, and some improvement can be achieved by augmenting the byte-length measure by scores derived from lexical feature matching (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ This formulation is so extremely general that it is difficult to argue against its pure form.

For instance, the statistical correlation of sentence length between English and Chinese is not as high as that between two Indo European languages (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ More controversial are the approximations that must be made to obtain a tractable version.

As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ More controversial are the approximations that must be made to obtain a tractable version.
