In byte-length ratio approaches, the presence of long stretches of blocks that have roughly similar lengths can be problematic, and some improvement can be achieved by augmenting the byte-length measure by scores derived from lexical feature matching (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ An alignment A is a set consisting of L1 ,== L2 pairs where each L1 or L2 is an English or Chinese passage.

For instance, the statistical correlation of sentence length between English and Chinese is not as high as that between two Indo European languages (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts.
For instance, the statistical correlation of sentence length between English and Chinese is not as high as that between two Indo European languages (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ If translated sentences share cognates, then the character lengths of those cognates are of course correlated.

As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ The proposals that we make on public assistance, both the increase in scale rates, and the relaxation of the absence rule, are substantial steps forward in Hong Kong which will, I think, be very widely welcomed.

There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment: the length-based approach (Gale and Church 1991 and Brown et al 1991), the lexical approach (Key and Roscheisen 1993), and the combination of them (Chen 1993, Wu 1994 and Langlais 1998, etc.). $$$$$ To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical demonstration that a pure length-based method can yield high accuracy sentence alignments between parallel texts in Indo-European and entirely dissimilar non-alphabetic, non-IndoEuropean languages.

The first sentence alignment model used to align English-Chinese bilingual texts is proposed by Wu (1994). $$$$$ Our report concerns three related topics: (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus; (2) experiments addressing applicability of Gale (1991) lengthbased statistical method to the task of alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and (3) an improved statistical method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.

(DeKai Wu, 1994) offered that (1:1) sentence beads occupied 89% in English-Chinese as well. $$$$$ To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical demonstration that a pure length-based method can yield high accuracy sentence alignments between parallel texts in Indo-European and entirely dissimilar non-alphabetic, non-IndoEuropean languages.
