But work such as (Kozima, 1993), (Ferret, 1998) or (Kaufmann, 1999) showed that using a domain independent source of knowledge for text segmentation doesn't necessarily lead to get better results than work that is only based on word distribution in texts. $$$$$ LCP records mutual similarity of words in a sequence of text.

This significance is defined as in (Kozima, 1993) as its normalized information in a reference corpus. $$$$$ Similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on a semantic network which is systematically constructed from an English dictionary (LDOCE).

For example, the lexical cohesion profile (Kozima, 1993) should be perfectly usable with our fragmentation method. $$$$$ (Consider a list of average meaning of segments.)

Ever since Morris and Hirst (1991)'s ground breaking paper, topic segmentation has been a steadily growing research area in computational linguistics, with applications in summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997), information retrieval (Salton and Allan, 1994), and text understanding (Kozima, 1993). $$$$$ Experiments on several window widths (A =5 — 60) reveals that the Hanning window of A =25 gives the best correlation between LCP and segments.

Therefore, many approaches have concentrated on different ways of estimating lexical coherence of text segments, such as semantic similarity between words (Kozima, 1993), similarity between blocks of text (Hearst, 1994), and adaptive language models (Beeferman et al, 1999). $$$$$ VMP is a record of the number of new vocabulary terms introduced in an interval of text.
