Lexical cohesion techniques include similarity measures between adjacent blocks of text, as in TextTiling (Hearst, 1994, 1997) and lexical chains based on recurrences of a term or related terms, as in Morris and Hirst (1991), Kozima (1993), and Galley, et al. $$$$$ For example, i = 156 is a paragraph boundary, but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment boundary; i = 236 is both a segment boundary and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not a paragraph boundary.

As in Kozima's work (Kozima, 1993), this computation operates on words belonging to a focus window that is moved all over the text. $$$$$ This paper proposes a new indicator of text structure, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a text.
As in Kozima's work (Kozima, 1993), this computation operates on words belonging to a focus window that is moved all over the text. $$$$$ It is clear that the valleys of the LCP correspond mostly to the dominant segment boundaries.

Related words have been located using spreading activation on a semantic network (Kozima, 1993), although only one text was segmented. $$$$$ Experiments on several window widths (A =5 — 60) reveals that the Hanning window of A =25 gives the best correlation between LCP and segments.
Related words have been located using spreading activation on a semantic network (Kozima, 1993), although only one text was segmented. $$$$$ In future research, the author needs to examine validity of LCP for other genres — Hearst (1993) segments expository texts.

But work such as (Kozima, 1993), (Ferret, 1998) or (Kaufmann, 1999) showed that using a domain independent source of knowledge for text segmentation doesn't necessarily lead to get better results than work that is only based on word distribution in texts. $$$$$ This paper proposed LCP, all indicator of segment changing, which concentrates on lexical cohesion of a text. segment.

This significance is defined as in (Kozima, 1993) as its normalized information in a reference corpus. $$$$$ This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text.

He identified topic boundaries where the LCP score was low (Kozima, 1993). $$$$$ Experiments on several window widths (A =5 — 60) reveals that the Hanning window of A =25 gives the best correlation between LCP and segments.
He identified topic boundaries where the LCP score was low (Kozima, 1993). $$$$$ The shape of the window, which defines weight of words in it for pattern production, makes LCP smooth.

For example, the lexical cohesion profile (Kozima, 1993) should be perfectly usable with our fragmentation method. $$$$$ Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure.
For example, the lexical cohesion profile (Kozima, 1993) should be perfectly usable with our fragmentation method. $$$$$ For example: The following examples show the relationship between the word significance and the similarity:
For example, the lexical cohesion profile (Kozima, 1993) should be perfectly usable with our fragmentation method. $$$$$ Similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on a semantic network which is systematically constructed from an English dictionary (LDOCE).

Ever since Morris and Hirst (1991)'s ground breaking paper, topic segmentation has been a steadily growing research area in computational linguistics, with applications in summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997), information retrieval (Salton and Allan, 1994), and text understanding (Kozima, 1993). $$$$$ The experiment proved that LCP closely correlate with the segment boundaries captured by the human judgments, and that lexical cohesion plays main role in forming a sequence of words into segments.

Therefore, many approaches have concentrated on different ways of estimating lexical coherence of text segments, such as semantic similarity between words (Kozima, 1993), similarity between blocks of text (Hearst, 1994), and adaptive language models (Beeferman et al, 1999). $$$$$ Their method can capture almost all the types of lexical cohesion, e.g. systematic and non-systematic semantic relation.
