Similar to our approach, Brockettet al (2006) view error correction as a Machine Translation problem. $$$$$ Our system was able to correct 61.81% of mistakes in a set of naturallyoccurring examples of mass noun errors found on the World Wide Web, suggesting that efforts to collect alignable corpora of preand post-editing ESL writing samples offer can enable the development of SMT-based writing assistance tools capable of repairing many of the complex syntactic and lexical problems found in the writing of ESL learners.

Similar to our approach, Brockettet al (2006) view error correction as a Machine Translation problem. $$$$$ From this dataset we culled about 346,000 sentences containing examples of the 14 targeted words.

Note that our approach is different from that of Brockett et al (2006), as we do make use of a truly multi-lingual translation model. $$$$$ Substituting the word much for many leaves the sentence stilted in a way that is probably undetectable to an inexperienced non-native speaker, while the use of the word knew represents a lexical selection error that falls well outside the scope of conventional proofing tools.

Note that our approach is different from that of Brockett et al (2006), as we do make use of a truly multi-lingual translation model. $$$$$ Rather than learning how strings in one language map to strings in another, however, “translation” now involves learning how systematic patterns of errors in ESL learners’ English map to corresponding patterns in native English If ESL error correction is seen as a translation task, the task can be treated as an SMT problem using the noisy channel model of (Brown et al., 1993): here the L2 sentence produced by the learner can be regarded as having been corrupted by noise in the form of interference from his or her L1 model and incomplete language models internalized during language learning.

Brockett et al (2006) employed phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to correct countability errors. $$$$$ To create a balanced training set that would not introduce too many artifacts of the substitution (e.g., many should not always be recast as much just because that is the only mapping observed in the training data), we randomly created an equivalent number of identity-mapped pairs from the 346,000 examples, with each sentence mapping to itself.
