The phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) technique is employed to identify and correct writing errors (Brockett et al, 2006). $$$$$ Since it is highly undesirable that learners should be presented with inaccurate feedback that they may not have the experience or knowledge to assess, the quality bar imposed on error correction is far higher than is that tolerated in machine translation.
The phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) technique is employed to identify and correct writing errors (Brockett et al, 2006). $$$$$ What distinguishes this system from other phrasal SMT systems is that rather than aligning simple sequences of words, it maps small phrasal “treelets” generated by a dependency parse to corresponding strings in the target.
