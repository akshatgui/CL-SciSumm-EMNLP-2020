Supervised methods such as (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and (Roth and Yih, 2004) provide only a partial solution, as there are many possible relations and entities of interest for a given domain, and such approaches require new annotated data each time a new relation or entity type is needed. $$$$$ At decision time, given a sentence, we produce a global decision that optimizes over the suggestions of the classifiers that are active in the sentence, known constraints among them and, potentially, domain or tasks specific constraints relevant to the current decision.
