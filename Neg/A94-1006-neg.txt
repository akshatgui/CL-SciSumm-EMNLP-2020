On the one hand, the linguistically-based or rule-based approaches use linguistic information such as PoS tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop words and restrict candidate terms to predefined syntactic patterns (Ananiadou, 1994), (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ Previously translated texts provide a major source of information about technical terms.

Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ We would also like to thank Bala Satish and Jon Helfman for their part in the project.
Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ The latter task becomes especially easy when a candidate overlaps with the correct translation, directing the attention of the user to the concordance lines of this particular candidate, which are likely to be aligned correctly.
Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ Technical terms are difficult for translators because they are generally not as familiar with the subject domain as either the author of the source text or the reader of the target text.
Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ We have found, however, that the manual pass dominates the cost of the monolingual task, and consequently, we have tried to design an interactive user interface (see Figure 1) that minimizes the burden on the expert terminologist.

Our system is most similar to Termight (Dagan and Church, 1994) and TransSearch (Macklovitch et al, 2000). $$$$$ We have shown that terminology research provides a good application for robust natural language technology, in particular for part-of-speech tagging and word-alignment algorithms.
Our system is most similar to Termight (Dagan and Church, 1994) and TransSearch (Macklovitch et al, 2000). $$$$$ In the fifth occurrence word_align failed to align the term correctly because another translation, Steuernienu, was uniquely used, violating the consistency requirement.
Our system is most similar to Termight (Dagan and Church, 1994) and TransSearch (Macklovitch et al, 2000). $$$$$ We would like to thank Pat Callow from AT&T Buiseness Translation Services (formerly AT&T Language Line Services) for her indispensable role in designing and testing termight.
Our system is most similar to Termight (Dagan and Church, 1994) and TransSearch (Macklovitch et al, 2000). $$$$$ For the remaining 53% of the terms, the correct answer was always somewhere in the concordances.
