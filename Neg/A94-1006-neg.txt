On the one hand, the linguistically-based or rule-based approaches use linguistic information such as PoS tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop words and restrict candidate terms to predefined syntactic patterns (Ananiadou, 1994), (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ The monolingual task appears to be an excellent candidate.

Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ We that part of speech tagging and word alignment could have an important role in glossary construction for translation.
Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ Some methods use sentence alignment and additional statistics to find candidate translations of terms (Smadja, 1992; van der Eijk, 1993).

Our system is most similar to Termight (Dagan and Church, 1994) and TransSearch (Macklovitch et al, 2000). $$$$$ We have shown that terminology research provides a good application for robust natural language technology, in particular for part-of-speech tagging and word-alignment algorithms.
