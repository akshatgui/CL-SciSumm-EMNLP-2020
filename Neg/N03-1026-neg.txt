Furthermore, we consider an F-score measure that is adapted from dependency-based parsing (Crouch et al., 2002) and sentence-condensation (Riezler et al,2003). $$$$$ Firstly, randomly chosen transferred f-structures were matched against the manually selected f-structures for the manually created condensations.
Furthermore, we consider an F-score measure that is adapted from dependency-based parsing (Crouch et al., 2002) and sentence-condensation (Riezler et al,2003). $$$$$ Since transferred f-structures are produced according to the number of rules applied to transfer them, in this setup the transfer system produces smaller f-structures first, and cuts off less condensed output.
Furthermore, we consider an F-score measure that is adapted from dependency-based parsing (Crouch et al., 2002) and sentence-condensation (Riezler et al,2003). $$$$$ Our system incorporates a linguistic parser/generator for LFG, a transfer component for parse reduction operating on packed parse forests, and a maximum-entropy model for stochastic output selection.

The intrinsic evaluation measures used in our experiments are the well-known BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) metrics, and an F-score measure that adapts evaluation techniques from dependency-based parsing (Crouch et al., 2002) and sentence-condensation (Riezler et al, 2003) to machine translation. $$$$$ Overall summarization quality of the proposed system is state-of-the-art, with guaranteed grammaticality of the system output due to the use of a constraint-based parser/generator.

We stand in a marked contrast to previous 'grafting' approaches which more or less rely on an ad-hoc collection of transformation rules to generate candidates (Riezler et al, 2003). $$$$$ The challenge for such systems is to guarantee the grammaticality and summarization quality of the system output, i.e. the generated sentences need to be syntactically wellformed and need to retain the most salient information of the original document.
We stand in a marked contrast to previous 'grafting' approaches which more or less rely on an ad-hoc collection of transformation rules to generate candidates (Riezler et al, 2003). $$$$$ For example a sentence extraction system might choose a sentence like: The UNIX operating system, with implementations from Apples to Crays, appears to have the advantage. from a document, which could be condensed as: UNIX appears to have the advantage.
We stand in a marked contrast to previous 'grafting' approaches which more or less rely on an ad-hoc collection of transformation rules to generate candidates (Riezler et al, 2003). $$$$$ Fine-grained dependency structures are output by the parser, then modified by a highly expressive transfer system, and filtered by a constraint-based generator.
We stand in a marked contrast to previous 'grafting' approaches which more or less rely on an ad-hoc collection of transformation rules to generate candidates (Riezler et al, 2003). $$$$$ Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence “headlines” for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000).

 $$$$$ Testset II consists of another randomly extracted 32 sentence pairs from the same domain, prepared in the same way.

 $$$$$ Two human judges were presented with the uncondensed surface string and five condensed strings that were displayed in random order for each test example.
 $$$$$ A prototype is ready and Leary hopes to set requirements for a full system.

Our results show that grammatical relations based F-score (Riezler et al 2003) correlates reliably with human judgements and could thus be used to measure compression performance automatically. $$$$$ Similar to these proposals, an evaluation of condensation quality could consider multiple reference condensations and record the matching score against the most similar example.
Our results show that grammatical relations based F-score (Riezler et al 2003) correlates reliably with human judgements and could thus be used to measure compression performance automatically. $$$$$ Recent work in statistical text summarization has put forward systems that do not merely extract and concatenate sentences, but learn how to generate new sentences from (Summary, Text) tuples.

Riezler et al (2003) present a discriminative sentence compressor over the output of an LFG parser that is a packed representation of possible compressions. $$$$$ In order to guarantee non-empty output for the overall condensation system, the generation component has to be fault-tolerant in cases where the transfer system operates on a fragmentary parse, or produces non-valid fstructures from valid input f-structures.

It is an important and growing field of natural language processing with applications in areas such as transfer based machine translation (Riezler and Maxwell, 2006) and sentence condensation (Riezler et al, 2003). $$$$$ These included a set of 32 sentence pairs that were used for testing purposes in Knight and Marcu (2000).

Riezler et al (2003) applied linguistically rich LFG grammars to a sentence compression system. $$$$$ For example, humans tend to make use of structural modifications such as nominalization and verb alternations such as active/passive or transitive/intransitive alternations in condensation.

Riezler et al (2003) applied linguistically rich LFG grammars to a sentence compression system. $$$$$ In contrast, a comparison between transfer runs with and without perfect disambiguation of the original string shows a decrease of about 5% in F-score, and of only .1 points for summarization quality when transferring from packed parses instead of from the manually selected parse.

One of the most widely used automatic metrics is the F1 measure over grammatical relations of the gold standard compressions (Riezler et al, 2003). $$$$$ Such alternations can easily be expressed in our transfer-based approach, whereas they impose severe problems to approaches that operate only on phrase structure trees.

As an automated metric of quality, we compute F-score based on grammatical relations (relational F1, or RelF1) (Riezler et al, 2003). $$$$$ For example a sentence extraction system might choose a sentence like: The UNIX operating system, with implementations from Apples to Crays, appears to have the advantage. from a document, which could be condensed as: UNIX appears to have the advantage.
