We have also tested a more complex version of e, with ei scores obtained from release 1.0 of Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b). $$$$$ In this paper we confront the task of deciding whether a given term has a positive or a negative connotation, no subjective connotation at this problem thus subsumes the problem of desubjectivity problem of determining orientation.
We have also tested a more complex version of e, with ei scores obtained from release 1.0 of Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b). $$$$$ Section 4 describes in detail three different variants of it we propose for determining, at the same time, subjectivity and orientation, and describes the general setup of our experiments.

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ In this paper we confront the task of deciding whether a given term has a positive or a negative connotation, no subjective connotation at this problem thus subsumes the problem of desubjectivity problem of determining orientation.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ In this paper we confront the task of determining whether a given term has a Positive connotation (e.g. honest, intrepid), or a Negative connotation (e.g. disturbing, superfluous), or has instead no Subjective connotation at all (e.g. white, triangular); this problem thus subsumes the problem of deciding between Subjective and Objective and the problem of deciding between Positive and Negative.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ Concerning the three approaches to classification described in Section 4.3, Approach II outperforms the other two, but by an extremely narrow margin.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ Note that, at each iteration k, a given term t is added to Trko only if it does not already belong to either Trp or Trn.

These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ Our algorithms have tagged by orientation and subjectivity the entire General Inquirer lexicon, a complete general-purpose lexicon that is the de facto standard benchmark for researchers in this field.
These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ This is believed to be of key importance for identifying the orientation of documents, since it is by considering the combined contribution of these terms that one may hope to solve Tasks 1, 2 and 3 above.
These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ The authors use two sets of 462 adjectives and 502 verbs, respectively, randomly extracted from the basic English word list of the TOEFL test.
These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ As for the choice of TrKo , we note that Tro and Tr4o elicit comparable levels of performance, with the former performing best at SO-accuracy and the latter performing best at PNO-accuracy.

Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ The methods of (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005) are instead difficult to compare with the other ones since they were not evaluated on publicly available datasets.
Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ Riloff et al. (2003) develop a method to determine whether a term has a Subjective or an Objective connotation, based on bootstrapping algorithms.
Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ This is believed to be of key importance for identifying the orientation of documents, i.e. determining whether a document expresses a positive or negative opinion about its subject matter.
Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ We tackle this problem by testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method previously proposed for orientation detection.

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ We tackle this problem by testing three different variants of the semi-supervised method for orientation detection proposed in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ Baroni and Vegnaduzzo (2004) apply the PMI method, first used by Turney and Littman (2003) to determine term orientation, to determine term subjectivity.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ The conceptually simplest approach to this latter problem is probably Turney’s (2002), who has obtained interesting results on Task 2 by considering the algebraic sum of the orientations of terms as representative of the orientation of the document they belong to; but more sophisticated approaches are also possible (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004).
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ The two main categories, and the ones we will be concerned with, are Positive/Negative, which contain 1,915/2,291 terms having a positive/negative orientation (in what follows we will also refer to the category Subjective, which we define as the union of the two categories Positive and Negative).

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ Each such representation is converted into vectorial form by standard text indexing techniques (in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) and in the present work, stop words are removed and the remaining words are weighted by cosine-normalized tfidf; no stemming is performed)5.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ Section 4 describes in detail three different variants of it we propose for determining, at the same time, subjectivity and orientation, and describes the general setup of our experiments.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ The methods described in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) is also limited by the fact that it can only decide the orientation of adjectives, while the method of (Kamps et al., 2004) is further limited in that it can only work on adjectives that are present in WordNet.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ Our algorithms have tagged by orientation and subjectivity the entire General Inquirer lexicon, a complete general-purpose lexicon that is the de facto standard benchmark for researchers in this field.

The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ We experiment with three “philosophically” different learning approaches to the problem of distinguishing between Positive, Negative, and Objective terms.
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ The method identifies patterns for the extraction of subjective nouns from text, bootstrapping from a seed set of 20 terms that the authors judge to be strongly subjective and have found to have high frequency in the text collection from which the subjective nouns must be extracted.
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ The terms that have been classified (i) into both (not Positive) and (not Negative), or (ii) into both Positive and Negative, are taken to be Objective.
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ The authors define two measures of such agreement: strict agreement, equivalent to our PNO-accuracy, and lenient agreement, which measures the accuracy at telling Negative against the rest.

Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al, 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al, 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a). $$$$$ This process is based on the hypothesis that synonymy and antonymy, in addition to defining a relation of meaning, also define a relation of orientation, i.e. that two synonyms typically have the same orientation and two antonyms typically have opposite orientation.
