We have also tested a more complex version of e, with ei scores obtained from release 1.0 of Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b). $$$$$ The results of this method are not easy to compare with the ones we present in this paper because of the different evaluation methodologies.
We have also tested a more complex version of e, with ei scores obtained from release 1.0 of Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b). $$$$$ We tackle this problem by testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method previously proposed for orientation detection.
We have also tested a more complex version of e, with ei scores obtained from release 1.0 of Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b). $$$$$ Takamura et al. (2005) determine term orientation (for Japanese) according to a “spin model”, i.e. a physical model of a set of electrons each endowed with one between two possible spin directions, and where electrons propagate their spin direction to neighbouring electrons until the system reaches a stable configuration.

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ For computing PMI, term frequencies and co-occurrence frequencies are measured by querying a document set by means of the AltaVista search engine1 with a “t” query, a “ti” query, and a “t NEAR ti” query, and using the number of matching documents returned by the search engine as estimates of the probabilities needed for the computation of PMI.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ A clustering algorithm then partitions the graph into a Positive cluster and a Negative cluster, based on a relation of similarity induced by the edges.

These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ Section 4 describes in detail three different variants of it we propose for determining, at the same time, subjectivity and orientation, and describes the general setup of our experiments.
These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ Therefore, their method, unlike our own, does not classify terms (i.e. take firm classification decisions), but ranks them according to a subjectivity score, on which they evaluate precision at various level of recall.
These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ Given a target term t, its orientation value O(t) (where positive value means positive orientation, and higher absolute value means stronger orientation) is given by the sum of the weights of its semantic association with the seed positive terms minus the sum of the weights of its semantic association with the seed negative terms.

Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ Note that, at each iteration k, a given term t is added to Trko only if it does not already belong to either Trp or Trn.
Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ To aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent work has tackled the issue determining the “subjective” terms contained in text, i.e. deciding whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation.
Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ Our results show that determining subjectivity and orientation is a much harder problem than determining orientation alone.

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ Our results show that determining subjectivity is a much harder problem than determining orientation alone.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ This is believed to be of key importance for identifying the orientation of documents, i.e. determining whether a document expresses a positive or negative opinion about its subject matter.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ Approach III consists instead in viewing Positive, Negative, and Objective as three categories with equal status, and in learning a ternary classifier that classifies each term into exactly one among the three categories.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ The methods described in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) is also limited by the fact that it can only decide the orientation of adjectives, while the method of (Kamps et al., 2004) is further limited in that it can only work on adjectives that are present in WordNet.

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ Once the vectorial representations for all terms in TrUT e have been generated, those for the terms in Tr are fed to a supervised learner, which thus generates a binary classifier.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ This hypothesis is confirmed by an experiment performed by Kim and Hovy (2004) on testing the agreement of two human coders at tagging words with the Positive, Negative, and Objective labels.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ Most previous works dealing with the properties of terms within an opinion mining perspective have focused on determining term orientation.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ While we adopt the evaluation methodology used in all of the papers reviewed so far (i.e. checking how good our system is at replicating an existing, independently motivated lexical resource), the authors do not test their method on an independently identified set of labelled terms, but on the set of terms that the algorithm itself extracts.

The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ The two main categories, and the ones we will be concerned with, are Positive/Negative, which contain 1,915/2,291 terms having a positive/negative orientation (in what follows we will also refer to the category Subjective, which we define as the union of the two categories Positive and Negative).
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ We may notice this by looking at Table 3, which shows the average proportion of test terms classified as Objective by each learner, depending on whether we have chosen Tro to coincide with Tr3o or Tr4o; note that the former (resp. latter) choice means having roughly as many (resp. roughly five times as many) Objective training terms as there are Positive and Negative ones.
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ This has been shown by testing several variants of the basic algorithm, some of them involving radically different supervised learning policies.
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ Our results thus constitute, for this task, the first baseline for other researchers to improve upon.

Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al, 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al, 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a). $$$$$ The second main feature of the method presented in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) is that terms are given vectorial representations based on their WordNet glosses (i.e. textual definitions).
