Sister-adjunctionis not an operation found in standard de ni tions of TAG, but is borrowed from D-TreeGrammar (Rambow et al, 1995). $$$$$ From the definition of DTG in Section 2 it can be seen that the essential aspects of Schabes & Shieber (1994) treatment for modification, including multiple modifications of a phrase, can be captured by using this operation4.

 $$$$$ When a d-tree is subserted into another d-tree component of a is substituted at a frontier nonterminal node (a node) and all components of a that are above the substituted component are inserted into d-edges above the substituted node or placed above the root node.
 $$$$$ Rambow was supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under a Grant awarded in 1993, while at TALANA, Universite Paris 7.
 $$$$$ In a more refined version of the formalism we would associate (a single) finite-valued feature structure with each node'.
 $$$$$ A d-tree is a tree with two types of edges: domination edges (d-edges) and immediate domination edges (i-edges).

These spines can be combined using a sister-ad junction operation (Rambow et al, 1995), to form larger pieces of structure. $$$$$ Thus, they fail to address the first problem we discussed (in Section 1.1).

Chiang's model adds a third composition operation called sister-ad junction (see Figure 3), borrowed from D-tree substitution grammar (Rambow et al, 1995). $$$$$ We will also study the formal properties of DTG, and complete the design of the Earley style parser.

Chiang's model adds a third composition operation called sister-ad junction (see Figure 3), borrowed from D-tree substitution grammar (Rambow et al, 1995). $$$$$ The entries in this array recording derivations of substrings of input contain a set of elementary nodes along with a multi-set of components that must be inserted above during bottom-up recognition.
Chiang's model adds a third composition operation called sister-ad junction (see Figure 3), borrowed from D-tree substitution grammar (Rambow et al, 1995). $$$$$ This is handled by a SAC associated with the N' node that allows all trees rooted in AdjP to be left sister-adjoined.

Variants of TAG like TIG (Schabes and Waters, 1995) or D-Tree grammars (Rambow et al, 1995) are motivated by linguistic or formal considerations rather than pedagogical or computational ones. $$$$$ Rambow was supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under a Grant awarded in 1993, while at TALANA, Universite Paris 7.

Other formalisms aiming to model dependency correctly similarly expand weak generative capacity, notably D-tree Substitution Grammar (Rambow et al, 1995), and consequently end up with much greater parsing complexity. $$$$$ However, this was found to be insufficient for treating both long-distance scrambling and long-distance topicalization in German.

Consider the case of sentences which contain both bridge and raising verbs, noted by Rambow et al (1995). $$$$$ Clausal complementation could not be handled uniformly by substitution because of the existence of syntactic phenomena such as long-distance wh-movement in English.

Consider the case of sentences which contain both bridge and raising verbs, noted by Rambow et al (1995). $$$$$ However, they represent important linguistic intuition, they provide a uniform interface to semantics, and they are, as Schabes & Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks and appropriate constraints in many frameworks, complementation and modification are in fact made & Kaplan, 1982) provides a separate functional (f-) structure, and dependency grammars (see e.g.
Consider the case of sentences which contain both bridge and raising verbs, noted by Rambow et al (1995). $$$$$ Thus, nodes separated by an i-edge will remain in a mother-daughter relationship throughout the derivation, whereas nodes separated by an d-edge can be equated or have a path of any length inserted between them during a derivation.

A more recent instance is D-Tree Substitution Grammars (DSG) (Rambow et al, 1995), where the derivations are also interpreted as dependency relations. $$$$$ This is done by either using appropriate feature constraints at nodes or by means of subsertion-insertion constraints (see Section 2).
