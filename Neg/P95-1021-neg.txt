It also has much in common with d tree substitution grammar (Rambow et al, 1995). $$$$$ The resulting phrase structure tree would be the same as in the previously discussed derivation, but the derivation structure is linguistically meaningless, since to adore would have been subserted into both seems and claims.

 $$$$$ We subsert the resulting structure into the seems clause by substituting its maximal projection node, labelled VP[fin: 1, at the VP[fin: -] frontier node of seems, and by inserting the subject into the d-edge of the seems tree.

Other formalisms aiming to model dependency correctly similarly expand weak generative capacity, notably D-tree Substitution Grammar (Rambow et al, 1995), and consequently end up with much greater parsing complexity. $$$$$ In this section, we have discussed examples where the elementary objects have been obtained by projecting from lexical items.
