(Cherry and Lin, 2006) used dependency structures as soft constraints to improve word alignment in an ITG framework. $$$$$ Methods like competitive linking (Melamed, 2000) and maximum matching (Taskar et al., 2005) use a one-toone constraint, where words in either sentence can participate in at most one link.

(Cherry and Lin, 2006) used dependency structures as soft constraints to improve word alignment in an ITG framework. $$$$$ When this occurs, the alignment is said to maintain phrasal cohesion.

Cherry and Lin (2006) introduce soft syntactic ITG (Wu, 1997) constraints into a discriminative model, and use an ITG parser to constrain the search for a Viterbi alignment. $$$$$ Others parse one of the two strings before alignment begins, and align the resulting tree to the remaining string (Yamada and Knight, 2001).
Cherry and Lin (2006) introduce soft syntactic ITG (Wu, 1997) constraints into a discriminative model, and use an ITG parser to constrain the search for a Viterbi alignment. $$$$$ ITGs perform string-to-string alignment, but do so through a parsing algorithm that will allow us to inform the objective function of our dependency tree.
Cherry and Lin (2006) introduce soft syntactic ITG (Wu, 1997) constraints into a discriminative model, and use an ITG parser to constrain the search for a Viterbi alignment. $$$$$ However, this hard constraint can also rule out correct alignments, and its utility decreases as alignment models become more complex.

At the intersection of these lines of work, discriminative ITG models have also been proposed, including one-to-one alignment models (Cherry and Lin, 2006) and block models (Haghighi et al, 2009). $$$$$ Fox (2002) measured phrasal cohesion in gold standard alignments by counting crossings.

An exception to this is the work of Cherry and Lin (2006), who discriminatively trained one-to-one ITG models, albeit with limited feature sets. $$$$$ We will refer to the parsed language as English, and the unparsed language as Foreign.
An exception to this is the work of Cherry and Lin (2006), who discriminatively trained one-to-one ITG models, albeit with limited feature sets. $$$$$ The algorithm then iterates: the optimizer minimizes (3) again with the new constraint set, and solves the max cost problem for i = i + 1 with the new ~w, growing the constraint set if necessary.
An exception to this is the work of Cherry and Lin (2006), who discriminatively trained one-to-one ITG models, albeit with limited feature sets. $$$$$ Terminal productions produce a token in each stream, or a token in one stream with the null symbol 0 in the other.

(Cherry and Lin, 2006) modify an ITG aligner by introducing a penalty for induced parses that violate syntactic bracketing constraints. $$$$$ In (Zhang and Gildea, 2004), this model was tested on the same annotated French-English sentence pairs that we divided into training and test sets for our experiments; it achieved an AER of 0.15.

The first is to relax or update the independence assumptions based on more information, usually syntactic, from the language pairs (Cherry and Lin, 2006). $$$$$ Both sentences are decomposed into constituent phrases simultaneously, producing a word alignment as a byproduct.

Fox (2002) showed that cohesion is held in the vast majority of cases for English-French, while Cherry and Lin (2006) have shown it to be a strong feature for word alignment. $$$$$ Several other aligners have used discriminative training.
Fox (2002) showed that cohesion is held in the vast majority of cases for English-French, while Cherry and Lin (2006) have shown it to be a strong feature for word alignment. $$$$$ Since all ITG movement can be explained by inversions, this constrained ITG cannot interrupt one dependency phrase with part of another.

Fox (2002) demonstrated and counted cases where cohesion was not maintained in hand aligned sentence-pairs, while Cherry and Lin (2006) showed that a soft cohesion constraint is superior to a hard constraint for word alignment. $$$$$ They maximize summed link values v(l), where v(l) is defined as follows for an l = (Ej, Fk): All three aligners link based on 02 correlation scores, breaking ties in favor of closer pairs.
