As a discourse progresses, an adequate discourse model must represent the relevant entities, and the relationships between them (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), A speaker may then felicitously refer anaphorically to an object (subject to focusing or centering constraints (Grosz et al, 1983, Sidner 1981, 1983, Brennan et al 1987)) if there is an existing DE representing it, or if a corresponding DE may be directly inferred from an existing DE. $$$$$ For example, the Gricean-intention for utterance (15) in the movies example (Section 3.1) is derived from a combination of facts about the utterance itself, and from its place in the discourse.

It was reported that the lexical chains closely correlated to the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the texts, where the start and end of chains coincided with the intention ranges. $$$$$ Not only is the contribution of utterance-level intentions to DSPs complicated, but in some instances the DSP for a segment may both constrain and be partially determined by the Gricean intention for some utterance in the segment.
It was reported that the lexical chains closely correlated to the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the texts, where the start and end of chains coincided with the intention ranges. $$$$$ By the same token, the discourse participants' mental-state correlates of the intentional structure are not prebuilt; neither participant may have a complete model of the intentional structure &quot;in mind&quot; until the discourse is completed.
It was reported that the lexical chains closely correlated to the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the texts, where the start and end of chains coincided with the intention ranges. $$$$$ Flashbacks are also distinct from normally embedded discourses because of the precedence relationship between the DSPs for the two segments and the order in which the segments occur.
It was reported that the lexical chains closely correlated to the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the texts, where the start and end of chains coincided with the intention ranges. $$$$$ Referring expressions provide the primary example of this effect.3 The segmentation of discourse constrains the use of referring expressions by delineating certain points at which there is a significant change in what entities (objects, properties, or relations) are being discussed.

As Grosz and Sidner (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) pointed out, cue phrases such as now and well serve to indicate a topic change. $$$$$ Both of them, unlike the interruptions discussed here, share a DSP with their preceding segment and thus do not conform to our definition of interruption.

Indeed, the COLLAGEN architecture, like that of the Queen's Communicator, manages discourse using a focus stack, a classical idea in the theory of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state.

Examples of such models and their implementation are the information state-update approach (an implemented system is described in (Larsson, 2002)), or more linguistically oriented approaches like the adjacency-pair models or intentional models such as GROSZ and SIDNER's (see (Grosz and Sidner, 1986)). $$$$$ Several difficult research problems remain to be explored.
