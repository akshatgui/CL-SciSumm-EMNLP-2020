This belief that different aspects of discourse would be related, is what led Grosz and Sidner (1986b) to propose a theory that linked what they called the intentional structure of discourse, with its linguistic structure and with the reader or listener's cognitive attentional structure. $$$$$ In this section, we explore the predictions of our discourse structure theory about different uses of these phrases and the explanations the theory offers for their various roles.

Therefore, it is appropriate to close the initial summary with propositions from the computational class so that the whole graphic is in the user's focus of attention (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ The dominance relationships that actually shape the intentional structure cannot be known a priori, because the specific intentions that will come into play are not known (never by the OCP, hardly ever by the ICP) until the utterances in the discourse have been made.
