This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person's four-star review is another's two-star. $$$$$ One possible interpretation is that the relevant structure of the problem is already captured by linear regression (and perhaps a different kernel for regression would have improved its three-class performance).
This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person's four-star review is another's two-star. $$$$$ Alternatively, we can take a regression perspective by assuming that the labels come from a discretization of a continuous function mapping from the or negative.
This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person's four-star review is another's two-star. $$$$$ We then present three types of algorithms — one-vs-all, regression, and metric labeling — that can be distinguished by how explicitly they attempt to leverage similarity between items and between labels.

 $$$$$ To make the classes more balanced, we folded these minority classes into the adjacent class, thus arriving at a four-class problem (categories 0-3, increasing in positivity).
 $$$$$ (The inner summation is familiar from work in locally-weighted shows that in aggregate, the vocabularies of distant classes overlap to a degree surprisingly similar to that of the vocabularies of nearby classes.
 $$$$$ Then, we apply a based on a labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given-ary classifier’s output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items receive similar labels.
 $$$$$ A simple hypothesis is that ratings can be determined by the positive-sentence percentage (PSP) of a text, i.e., the number of positive sentences divided by the number of subjective sentences.

We use a sentiment-annotated data set consisting of movie reviews by (Pang and Lee, 2005) and tweets from http $$$$$ (Termbased versions of this premise have motivated much sentiment-analysis work for over a decade (Das and Chen, 2001; Tong, 2001; Turney, 2002).)

There is a huge body of work on OM in movie reviews which was sparked by the dataset from Pang and Lee (2005). $$$$$ We consider the final output to be a label preference function , defined as the signed distance of (test) item to the side of the vs. not-decision plane.

Pang and Lee (2005) use metric labeling to perform multi-class collective classification of movie reviews. $$$$$ Koppel and Schler (2005) independently found in a three-class study that thresholding a positive/negative classifier trained only on clearly positive or clearly negative examples did not yield large improvements.
Pang and Lee (2005) use metric labeling to perform multi-class collective classification of movie reviews. $$$$$ In our particular rating-inference setting, it so happens that the basis for our pairwise similarity measure can be incorporated as an item-specific feature, but we view this as a tangential issue.
Pang and Lee (2005) use metric labeling to perform multi-class collective classification of movie reviews. $$$$$ Open icons: SVMs in either one-versus-all (square) or regression (circle) mode; dark versions: metric labeling using the corresponding SVM together with the positive-sentence percentage (PSP).
Pang and Lee (2005) use metric labeling to perform multi-class collective classification of movie reviews. $$$$$ Note that this differs from identifying opinion strength (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa, 2004): rants and raves have the same strength but represent opposite evaluations, and referee forms often allow one to indicate that one is very confident (high strength) that a conference submission is mediocre (middling rating).

 $$$$$ In a sense, we are using explicit item and label similarity information to increasingly penalize the initial classifier as it assigns more divergent labels to similar items.
 $$$$$ In the future, we would like to apply our methods to other scale-based classification problems, and explore alternative methods.
 $$$$$ Finally, as mentioned in Section 3.3, we would like to address the transductive setting, in which one has a small amount of labeled data and uses relationships between unlabeled items, since it is particularly well-suited to the metric-labeling approach and may be quite important in practice.
 $$$$$ We then present three types of algorithms — one-vs-all, regression, and metric labeling — that can be distinguished by how explicitly they attempt to leverage similarity between items and between labels.

In order to compare our approach to other methods we also show results on commonly used sentiment datasets $$$$$ We show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.

The optimal POS bi-tags have been derived experimentally by using top 10% features on information gain based-pruning classifier on polarity dataset by (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ In order to make comparisons between these methods meaningful, we base all three of them on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as implemented in Joachims’ The standard SVM formulation applies only to binary classification.

This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ Preliminary analysis of the effect of varying the regression parameterin the four-class case revealed that the default value was often optimal.
This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ We can potentially develop a more useful similarity metric by asking ourselves what, intuitively, accounts for the label relationships that we seek to exploit.

Machine learning techniques have been proposed for sentiment classification (Pang et al., 2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004) based on annotated samples from experts, but they have limited performance especially when estimating ratings of a multi-point scale (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ We also thank CMU for its hospitality during the year.

We then adopt the machine learning method proposed in (Pangand Lee, 2005) and the Bayesian Network classifier (Russell and Norvig, 2002) for feature rating estimation. $$$$$ We first ran a small pilot study on human subjects in order to establish a rough idea of what a reasonable classification granularity is: if even people cannot accurately infer labels with respect to a five-star scheme with half stars, say, then we cannot expect a learning algorithm to do so.

RT-s $$$$$ In what follows, we first demonstrate that humans can discern relatively small differences in (hidden) evaluation scores, indicating that rating inference is indeed a meaningful task.
RT-s $$$$$ Note that the four-class problem seems to offer more possibilities for leveraging class relationship information than the three-class setting, since it involves more class pairs.

We might attempt to exploit these dependencies in a manner similar to Pang and Lee (2005) to improve three-way classification. $$$$$ So, 2 stars can be positive.” Thus, calibration may sometimes require strong familiarity with the authors involved, as anyone who has ever needed to reconcile conflicting referee reports probably knows.

We might attempt to exploit these dependencies in a manner similar to Pang and Lee (2005) to improve three-way classification. $$$$$ In full generality, the corresponding multi-label optimization problem is intractable, but for many families of functions (e.g., convex) there exist practical exact or approximation algorithms based on techniques for finding minimum s-t cuts in graphs (Ishikawa and Geiger, 1998; Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih, 1999; Ishikawa, 2003).

Data $$$$$ Even though Eric Lurio uses a 5 star system, his grading is very relaxed.
Data $$$$$ As another example, hierarchical label relationships can be easily encoded in a label metric.
Data $$$$$ Another choice is ordinal regression (McCullagh, 1980; Herbrich, Graepel, and Obermayer, 2000), which only considers the ordering on labels, rather than any explicit distances between them; this approach could work well if a good metric on labels is lacking.
