This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person's four-star review is another's two-star. $$$$$ Another choice is ordinal regression (McCullagh, 1980; Herbrich, Graepel, and Obermayer, 2000), which only considers the ordering on labels, rather than any explicit distances between them; this approach could work well if a good metric on labels is lacking.

 $$$$$ Also, our task differs from ranking not only because one can be given a single item to classify (as opposed to a set of items to be ordered relative to one another), but because there are settings in which classification is harder than ranking, and vice versa.
 $$$$$ But counterexamples are easy to construct: reviews can contain off-topic opinions, or recount many positive aspects before describing a fatal flaw.

In order to compare our approach to other methods we also show results on commonly used sentiment datasets: movie reviews (MR) (Pang and Lee, 2005) and opinions5 (MPQA) (Wiebe et al, 2005). $$$$$ In our particular rating-inference setting, it so happens that the basis for our pairwise similarity measure can be incorporated as an item-specific feature, but we view this as a tangential issue.

Cascaded models for sentiment classification were studied by (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ We show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant improvements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when we employ a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.
Cascaded models for sentiment classification were studied by (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ In particular, we consider linear,-insensitive SVM regression (Vapnik, 1995; Smola and Sch¨olkopf, 1998); the idea is to find the hyperplane that best fits the training data, but where training points whose labels are within distanceof the hyperplane incur no loss.
Cascaded models for sentiment classification were studied by (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ We therefore tested the hypothesis as follows.

This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ This task represents an interesting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are several different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example, “three stars” is intuitively closer to “four stars” than to “one star”.

This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ However, there was large variation in accuracy between subjects.2 Because of this variation, we defined two different classification regimes.
This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ At any rate, we view the fact that metric labeling performed quite well for both rating scales as a definitely positive result.

 $$$$$ Thus, item similarity as measured by TO(cos) may not correlate well with similarity of the item’s true labels.
 $$$$$ In our setting, we can also incorporate class relations by directly altering the output of a binary classifier, as follows.
 $$$$$ Fixing and to those values yielding the best performance, we then re-train A (but with SVM parameters fixed, as described above) on the whole training set.
 $$$$$ Koppel and Schler (2005) independently found in a three-class study that thresholding a positive/negative classifier trained only on clearly positive or clearly negative examples did not yield large improvements.

Pang and Lee (2005) treat sentiment analysis as an ordinal ranking problem. $$$$$ We then present three types of algorithms — one-vs-all, regression, and metric labeling — that can be distinguished by how explicitly they attempt to leverage similarity between items and between labels.

Machine learning techniques have been proposed for sentiment classification (Pang et al., 2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004) based on annotated samples from experts, but they have limited performance especially when estimating ratings of a multi-point scale (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ We first train a standard SVM, treating ratings greater than 0.5 as positive labels and others as negative labels.

In 2005, Pang and Lee extended their earlier work in (Pang and Lee, 2004) to determine a reviewer's evaluation with respect to multi scales (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ Regression implicitly encodes the “similar items, similar labels” heuristic, in that one can restrict consideration to “gradual” functions.

We adopt the approach of Pangand Lee (Pang and Lee, 2005) described in Section 2 for feature rating estimation. $$$$$ In a sense, we are using explicit item and label similarity information to increasingly penalize the initial classifier as it assigns more divergent labels to similar items.
