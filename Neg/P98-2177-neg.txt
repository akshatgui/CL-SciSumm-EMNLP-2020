(Ratnaparkhi, 1998) first assumes noun attachment for all of-PPs and then applies his disambiguation methods to all remaining PPs. $$$$$ Most of the previous successful approaches to this problem have been statistical or corpusbased, and they consider only prepositions whose attachment is ambiguous between a preceding noun phrase and verb phrase.

The current unsupervised state of the art achieves 81.9% attachment accuracy (Ratnaparkhi, 1998). $$$$$ Since only a small part of the extraction heuristic is specific to English, and since partof-speech taggers and morphology databases are widely available in other languages, our approach is far more portable than previous approaches for this problem.

 $$$$$ While the extracted tuples of the form (n, p, n2) and (v, p, n2) represent unambiguous noun and verb attachments in which either the verb or noun is known, our eventual goal is to resolve ambiguous attachments in the test data of the form (v, n,p, n2), in which both the noun n and verb v are always known.

 $$$$$ Three native Spanish speakers were asked to extract and annotate ambiguous instances of Spanish prepositional phrase attachments.
 $$$$$ For example, the task in the following examples is to decide whether the preposition with modifies the preceding noun phrase (with head word shirt) or the preceding verb phrase (with head word bought or washed).

 $$$$$ We use word statistics from both the tagged corpus and the set of extracted head word tuples to estimate the probability of generating 0 = true, p, and n2.

More recently, Ratnaparkhi (1998) developed an unsupervised method that collects statistics from text annotated with part-of-speech tags and morphological base forms. $$$$$ Prepositional phrase attachment is the task of deciding, for a given preposition in a sentence, the attachment site that corresponds to the interpretation of the sentence.
More recently, Ratnaparkhi (1998) developed an unsupervised method that collects statistics from text annotated with part-of-speech tags and morphological base forms. $$$$$ The Penn Treebank is drawn from the 1989 Wall St. Journal data, so there is no possibility of overlap with our training data.

Ratnaparkhi (1998) notes that the test set contains errors, but does not correct them. $$$$$ Previous work has framed the problem as a classification task, in which the goal is to predict N or V, corresponding to noun or verb attachment, given the head verb v, the head noun n, the preposition p, and optionally, the object of the preposition n2.

A second model relevant to our discussion is the one proposed in (Ratnaparkhi,1998), addressing the problem of unsupervised learning for PP attachment resolution in VERB NOUN PP sequences. $$$$$ The heuristic ignores cases where p = of, since such cases are rarely ambiguous, and we opt to model them deterministically as noun attachments.

The model proposed in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) is similar to a version of our model based solely on equation (9), with no semantic information. $$$$$ Therefore, there is only one possible attachment site for the preposition, and either the verb v or the noun n does not exist, in the case of noun-attached preposition or a verb-attached preposition, respectively.
The model proposed in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) is similar to a version of our model based solely on equation (9), with no semantic information. $$$$$ In that step, unambiguous attachments from the FIDDITCH parser's output are initially used to resolve some of the ambiguous attachments, and the resolved cases are iteratively used to disambiguate the remaining unresolved cases.

equation (9) captures both the contribution from the random variable used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to denote the presence or absence of any preposition that is unambiguously attached to the noun or the verb in question, and the contribution from the conditional probability that a particular preposition will occur as unambiguous attachment to the verb or to the noun. $$$$$ Our unsupervised approach uses a heuristic based on attachment proximity and trains from raw text that is annotated with only part-of-speech tags and morphological base forms, as opposed to attachment information.
