Fidditch is one such deterministic parser, designed to provide a syntactic analysis of text as a tool for locating examples of various linguistically interesting structures (Hindle 1983). $$$$$ A first guess suggests that this must be a non-deterministic problem, requiring complex reasoning about what the speaker meant to say.

Hindle (1983) addressed the problem of correcting self repairs by adding rules to a deterministic parser that would remove the necessary text. $$$$$ The problem for the hearer, as for any natural language understanding system, is to determine what words are to be expunged from the actual words said to find the intended sentence.

(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration. $$$$$ The mechanism for editing self-corrections that I have proposed has as its essential operation expunging one of two identical elements.
(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration. $$$$$ This would suggest that, far from being an impediment to language learning, non-fluencies may in fact facilitate language acquisition by highlighting equivalent classes. expunction of edit signal only surface copy category copy stack copy restart failures remaining unclear and ungrammatical 127 This raises the general question of how children can acquire a language in the face of unrestrained non-fluency.
(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration. $$$$$ This requires only an ability to distinguish linguistic from nonlinguistic stuff, and it introduces the idea that edit signals signal an expunction site.

(Hindle, 1983) states that repairs are available for semantic analysis but provides no details on the representation to be used. $$$$$ Further study of the self-correction system promises to provide insights into the units of production and the nature of linguistic categories.

RIM builds upon Labov (1966) and Hindle (1983) by conceptually extending the EDIT SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS that repairs are acoustically or phonetically marked at the point of interruption of fluent speech. $$$$$ This editing system has been implemented as part of a deterministic parser, and tested on a wide range of sentences from transcribed speech.
RIM builds upon Labov (1966) and Hindle (1983) by conceptually extending the EDIT SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS that repairs are acoustically or phonetically marked at the point of interruption of fluent speech. $$$$$ The parser views the editing signal as occurring at the end of a constituent, because it marks the right edge of an expunged element.
RIM builds upon Labov (1966) and Hindle (1983) by conceptually extending the EDIT SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS that repairs are acoustically or phonetically marked at the point of interruption of fluent speech. $$$$$ (In the current implementation, the Stack Copy Editor is allowed to look at successive nodes in the stack, back to the first COMP node or attention shifting boundary.

One proposal for repair processing that lends itself to both incremental processing and the integration of speech cues into repair detection is that of Hindle (1983), who defines a typology of repairs and associated correction strategies in terms of extensions to a deterministic parser. $$$$$ I have described the nature of self-corrected speech (which is a major source of spoken non-fluencies) and how it can be resolved by simple editing rules within the context of a deterministic parser.

An hypothesized acoustic phonetic edit signal, "a markedly abrupt cut-off of the speech signal" (Hindle, 1983 ,p.123), is assumed to mark the interruption of fluent speech (cf. (Labov, 1966)). $$$$$ And suppose that this action can be initiated at any time up until CONSTRUCT X is completed, when a signal is returned that the construction is complete.

RIM incorporates two main assumptions of Hindle (1983) $$$$$ Linguists have been of less help in describing the nature of spoken non-fluencies than might have been hoped; relatively little attention has been devoted to the actual performance of speakers, and studies that claim to be based on performance data seem to ignore the problem of nonfluencies.

Other than syntactic knowledge includes grammar specific recovery rules such as recta-rules (Weishedel and Sondheimer, 1983), semantic or pragmatic knowledge which may depend on a particular domain (Carbonell and Hayes, 1983) or the characteristics of the ill-formed utterances observed in human discourse (Hindle, 1983). $$$$$ Thc transcripts are of sociolinguistic interviews of the sort developed by Labov and designed to elicit unreflecting speech that approximates natural conversation .• They are conversational interviews covering a range of topics, and they typically include considerable non-fluency.
