Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain be tween subject hood and being discourse-old. $$$$$ Incomplete knowledge structures emerge when references to already established discourse entities are simply not recognized, as in the case of conceptually neutral pronominal anaphora (e.g., er, 'it,' in example (1d) co-specifying with 316LT, a particular notebook introduced in example (la)).

Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain be tween subject hood and being discourse-old. $$$$$ As a consequence, we have redefined Rule 2 of the Centering Constraints (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, 215) appropriately.

For example, Strube and Hahn (1999) introduce Functional Centering, a variant of Centering Theory which utilizes information status distinctions between hearer-old and hearer-new entities. $$$$$ The new formulation is entirely based on functional notions, grounded in the information structure of utterances in a discourse.
For example, Strube and Hahn (1999) introduce Functional Centering, a variant of Centering Theory which utilizes information status distinctions between hearer-old and hearer-new entities. $$$$$ We motivated our proposal by the constraints that hold for a free-word-order language such as German and derived our results from empirical studies of real-world texts.
For example, Strube and Hahn (1999) introduce Functional Centering, a variant of Centering Theory which utilizes information status distinctions between hearer-old and hearer-new entities. $$$$$ Considering empirical evidence from a free-word-order language (German) we propose a revision of the principles guiding the ordering of discourse entities in the forward-looking center list within the centering model.

work has also been done on adapting the centering model to other, freer word order languages such as German (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ We would like to thank our colleagues from the Computational Linguistics Group in Freiburg and at the University of Pennsylvania for fruitful discussions, in particular Norbert Broker, Miriam Eckert, Aravind Joshi, Manfred Klenner, Nobo Komagata, Katja Markert, Peter Neuhaus, Ellen Prince, Rashmi Prasad, Owen Rambow, Susanne Schacht, and Bonnie Webber.

Finally, the scripts determine whether CBn is the same as CPn, known as the principle of cheapness (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ Strube (1996b) (with respect to centering) and Suri and McCoy (1994) (with respect to the focus model) describe similar approaches and provide algorithms for the interaction of the resolution of inter- and intrasentential anaphora, but the topic has certainly not been dealt with exhaustively.

 $$$$$ Connolly, Burger, and Day (1994) treat anaphora resolution as an ML classification problem and compare seven classifier approaches with the solution quality of a naive hand-crafted algorithm whose heuristics incorporate the well-known agreement and recency indicators.
 $$$$$ Accordingly, any hearer-old expression in utterance LI, is given the highest preference as a potential antecedent for an anaphoric expression in U1±1.
 $$$$$ These false referential descriptions result from unresolved nominal anaphora (e.g., Rechner, 'computer' in example (lc) co-specifies with 316LT in (la)).
 $$$$$ These features are packed in feature vectors—for each pair of an anaphor and its possible antecedent—and used to train a decision tree, employing Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm (Aone and Bennett 1996), or a whole battery of alternative classifiers in which hybrid variants yield the highest scores (Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994).

Arguably, the free word-order of German arguably leads to a clearer distinction between grammatical function, surface order, and in formation status (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ As a consequence, referentially ambiguous interpretations have to be dealt with in those cases in which several alternatives fulfill all the required syntactic and semantic constraints.

In general, however, the required knowledge sources are lacking, so they must be hand-coded and can only be applied in restricted domains (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ Kameyama further distinguishes, for tensed clauses, between sequential and hierarchical centering.

Strube and Hahn (1999) extend the context to more than the last sentence, but switch preference order between the last and the current sentence so that an antecedentes determined in the last sentence, whenever possible. $$$$$ At the methodological level, we develop arguments that (at least for some freeword-order languages) grammatical role criteria should be replaced by functional role criteria, since they seem to more adequately account for the ordering of discourse entities in the Cf list.

Strube (1998) and Strube and Hahn (1999) argue that the information status of an antecedent is more important than the grammatical role in which it occurs. $$$$$ An elaborate description of several of these preference criteria is supplied by Carbonell and Brown (1988) who discuss, among others, heuristics involving case role filling, semantic and pragmatic alignment, syntactic parallelism, syntactic topicalization, and intersentential recency.
Strube (1998) and Strube and Hahn (1999) argue that the information status of an antecedent is more important than the grammatical role in which it occurs. $$$$$ We see the redefinition of Rule 2 as the theoretical basis for a centering algorithm for pronoun resolution that simply uses the Cf as a preference ranking device like the basic centering algorithm shown in Table 3.
Strube (1998) and Strube and Hahn (1999) argue that the information status of an antecedent is more important than the grammatical role in which it occurs. $$$$$ We also augmented the ordering criteria of the forward-looking center list such that it accounts not only for (pro)nominal anaphora but also for inferables (restricted to the subset of functional anaphora), an issue that, up to now, has only been sketchily dealt with in the centering framework.
Strube (1998) and Strube and Hahn (1999) argue that the information status of an antecedent is more important than the grammatical role in which it occurs. $$$$$ This preference order reflects the presumed inference load put on the hearer to coherently decode a discourse.

Moreover, in order to compare our proposal with Centering approach, Functional Centering by Strube and Hahn (1999) has also been implemented. $$$$$ The theory claims, above all, that to the extent that a discourse adheres to these rules and constraints, its local coherence will increase and the inference load placed upon the hearer will decrease.
Moreover, in order to compare our proposal with Centering approach, Functional Centering by Strube and Hahn (1999) has also been implemented. $$$$$ The latter phenomenon (cf. the examples in the next section and the in-depth treatment in Hahn, Markert, and Strube [1996]) is usually only sketchily dealt with in the centering literature, e.g., by asserting that the entity in question &quot;is realized but not directly realized&quot; (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, 217).

Finally, a transition is considered to satisfy the CHEAPNESS constraint (Strube and Hahn, 1999) if Cb (ui)= Cp (ui). $$$$$ Note an interesting asymmetric relationship between these three types of anaphora.
Finally, a transition is considered to satisfy the CHEAPNESS constraint (Strube and Hahn, 1999) if Cb (ui)= Cp (ui). $$$$$ The features under consideration include lexical ones like categories, syntactic ones like grammatical roles, semantic ones like semantic classes, and text positional ones, e.g., the distance between anaphor and antecedent.
Finally, a transition is considered to satisfy the CHEAPNESS constraint (Strube and Hahn, 1999) if Cb (ui)= Cp (ui). $$$$$ Relating these approaches to our proposal, they already exhibit a weak preference for a single hearer-old (more precisely, evoked) discourse element.
Finally, a transition is considered to satisfy the CHEAPNESS constraint (Strube and Hahn, 1999) if Cb (ui)= Cp (ui). $$$$$ This indicates, at least, that heuristically based methods using simple combinations of features benefit from being exposed to and having to adapt to training data.
