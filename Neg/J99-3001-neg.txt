Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain be tween subject hood and being discourse-old. $$$$$ By this we mean indicators of whether or not a discourse entity in the current utterance refers to another discourse entity already introduced by previous utterances in the discourse.

For example, Strube and Hahn (1999) introduce Functional Centering, a variant of Centering Theory which utilizes information status distinctions between hearer-old and hearer-new entities. $$$$$ These new criteria are based on the distinction between hearer-old and hearer-new discourse entities.

Arguably, the free word-order of German arguably leads to a clearer distinction between grammatical function, surface order, and in formation status (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ Basically, we argue that rather than counting resolution rates for anaphora or comparing isolated transition types holding among head positions in the center lists—preferred transition types stand for a high degree of local coherence, while less preferred ones signal that the underlying discourse might lack coherence—one should consider adjacent transition pairs and annotate such pairs with the processing costs they incur.
Arguably, the free word-order of German arguably leads to a clearer distinction between grammatical function, surface order, and in formation status (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ These shortcomings might be traced back to the fact that the centering model, up to now, did not consider the role of the (main) verb of the utterance under scrutiny.

Thus the size of the annotated data (3,115 personal pronouns1, 2,198 possessive pronouns, 928 demonstrative pronouns) compares favourably with the size of evaluation data in other proposals (619 German pronouns in (Strube and Hahn, 1999), 2,477 English pronouns in (Ge et al, 1998), about 5,400 English co referential expressions in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)) .In the experiments, systems only looked for single NP antecedents. $$$$$ In the first one, we compare success rates for the resolution of pronominal anaphora that result from a grammaticalrole-driven centering algorithm and from a functional centering algorithm.

Moreover, in order to compare our proposal with Centering approach, Functional Centering by Strube and Hahn (1999) has also been implemented. $$$$$ We distinguish between two types of transition pairs, cheap ones and expensive ones. immediately preceding utterance, i.e., Cb(U) Cp(1-11-1)• In particular, chains of the RETAIN transition in passages where the Cb does not change (passages with constant theme) show that the grammatical ordering constraints for the forward-looking centers are not appropriate.
