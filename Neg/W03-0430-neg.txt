 $$$$$ (Using a set of fixed conjunction patterns instead of feature induction results in F1 73.34%, with about 1 million features; trialand-error tuning the fixed patterns would likely improve this.)
 $$$$$ The data is quite complex; for example the English data includes foreign person names (such as Yayuk Basuki and Innocent Butare), a wide diversity of locations (including sports venues such as The Oval, and rare location names such as Nirmal Hriday), many types of organizations (from company names such as 3M, to acronyms for political parties such as KDP, to location names used to refer to sports teams such as Cleveland), and a wide variety of miscellaneous named entities (from software such as Java, to nationalities such as Basque, to sporting competitions such as 1,000 Lakes Rally).

The first two terms correspond to the difference between the empirical expected value of feature fk and the model’s expected value: (˜E[fk]−EA[fk])N.

It works quite well on NE tagging tasks (McCallum and Li, 2003). $$$$$ The weights of a CRF, A={λ, ...}, are set to maximize the conditional log-likelihood of labeled sequences in some training set, D = {(o, l)(1), ...(o, l)(j), ...(o, l)(N)}: where the second sum is a Gaussian prior over parameters (with variance σ) that provides smoothing to help cope with sparsity in the training data.
It works quite well on NE tagging tasks (McCallum and Li, 2003). $$$$$ We start with no features, and over several rounds of feature induction: (1) consider a set of proposed new features, (2) select for inclusion those candidate features that will most increase the log-likelihood of the correct state path s(j), and (3) train weights for all features.
It works quite well on NE tagging tasks (McCallum and Li, 2003). $$$$$ For example, the need for labeled data can be drastically reduced by taking advantage of domain knowledge in the form of word lists, part-of-speech tags, character ngrams, and capitalization patterns.
It works quite well on NE tagging tasks (McCallum and Li, 2003). $$$$$ More generally, feature functions can ask powerfully arbitrary questions about the input sequence, including queries about previous words, next words, and conjunctions of all these, and fk(·) can range −oo...oo.
