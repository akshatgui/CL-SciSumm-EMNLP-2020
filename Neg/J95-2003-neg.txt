To summarize the results of our empirical evaluation, we claim that our proposal based on functional criteria leads to substantively better results for languages with free word order than the linear approach suggested by Grosz et al (1995) and the two approaches which prefer inter-sentential or intra-sentential ntecedents. $$$$$ It demonstrates that the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.

Our model is inspired by Centering (Grosz et al, 1995) and other entity-based models of coherence (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) in which an entity is in focus through a sequence of sentences. $$$$$ In a locally coherent discourse segment, shifts are followed by a sequence of continuations characterizing another stretch of locally coherent discourse.

Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ To describe these types, we need to introduce two new relations, realizes and directly realizes, that relate centers to linguistic expressions.
Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ A much more natural sequence results if &quot;Tony&quot; is used, as the sequence (4a)-(4e) illustrates.
