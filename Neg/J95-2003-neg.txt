Possible strategies for treating sentence-level anaphora within the centering framework are processing sentences linearly one clause at a time (as suggested by Grosz et al (1995)). $$$$$ Because the information needed to compute a unique interpretation for an utterance is not always available at the time the utterance occurs in the discourse, the ways in which a theory treats partial information affects its computational tractability as the basis for discourse interpretation.

To summarize the results of our empirical evaluation, we claim that our proposal based on functional criteria leads to substantively better results for languages with free word order than the linear approach suggested by Grosz et al (1995) and the two approaches which prefer inter-sentential or intra-sentential ntecedents. $$$$$ In contrast, immediate focusing referred to a more local focusing processâ€”one that relates to identifying the entity that an individual utterance most centrally concerns.

Finally, Poesio examined the hypothesis that finding the anchor of a BD involves knowing which entities are the CB and the CP in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ In Sidner's theory, each utterance provides an immediate discourse focus, an actor focus, and a set of potential foci.

Finally, Poesio examined the hypothesis that finding the anchor of a BD involves knowing which entities are the CB and the CP in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ This can be seen by observing that both discourses seem equally appropriate and that the backward-looking centers of (32b) and (33b) are respectively the husband and the lover, which are realized by their anaphoric elements.

pronouns involve local focusing while full lexical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ The differences can only be explained, however, by looking beyond the surface form of the utterances in the discourse; different types of referring expressions and different syntactic forms make different inference demands on a hearer or reader.
