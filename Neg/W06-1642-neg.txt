Various attempts have been made to incorporate discourse relations into sentiment analysis $$$$$ Building domain-dependent lexicons for many domains is much harder work than preparing domainindependent lexicons and syntactic patterns, because the possible lexical entries are too numerous, and they may differ in each domain.
Various attempts have been made to incorporate discourse relations into sentiment analysis $$$$$ We also tested the performance while varying the size of the initial lexicon L. We prepared three subsets of the initial lexicon, L0.8, L0.5, and L0.2, removing polar atoms randomly.
