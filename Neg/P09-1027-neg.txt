To reduce this kind of error introduced by the translator, Wan in (Wan, 2009) applied a co-training scheme. $$$$$ Machine translation services are used for eliminating the language gap between the training set and test set, and English features and Chinese features are considered as two independent views of the classification problem.

To reduce this kind of error introduced by the translator, Wan in (Wan, 2009) applied a co-training scheme. $$$$$ The sentiment polarity is usually positive or negative and the text genre is usually product review.

But as the conditional distribution can be quite different for the original language and the pseudo language produced by the machine translators, these two strategies give poor performance as reported in (Wan, 2009). $$$$$ In this study, we propose a co-training approach to improving the classification accuracy of polarity identification of Chinese product reviews.
