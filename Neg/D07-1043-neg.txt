Homogeneity refers to the degree that each cluster consists of data points primarily belonging to a single GS class, while completeness refers to the degree that each GS class consists of data points primarily assigned to a single cluster (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ Using this feature vector, we performed k-meansclustering and evaluate how successfully these di mensions represent differences between pitch accenttypes.
