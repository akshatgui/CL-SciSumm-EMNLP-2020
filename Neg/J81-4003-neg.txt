A number of nonconcatenative grammar formalisms has been put forward, such as head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extra position grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981). $$$$$ Rather; the relationship can only be described implicitly, by adding extra information to many unrelated rules in the grammar.

A number of nonconcatenative grammar formalisms has been put forward, such as head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extra position grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981). $$$$$ It is argued that certain important linguistic phenomena, collectively known in transformational grammar as left extraposition, can be described better in XGs than in earlier grammar formalisms based on definite clauses.
A number of nonconcatenative grammar formalisms has been put forward, such as head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extra position grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981). $$$$$ Thinking procedurally, one can say that a nonterminal may be expanded by matching it to the leading symbol on the left-hand side of a rule, and the rest of the left-hand side is &quot;put aside&quot; to wait for the derivation of symbols which match each of its symbols in sequence.

Other non-concatenative formalisms are head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extra position grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981) and various exotic forms of tree adjoining grammar (Kroch and Joshi, 1986). $$$$$ In a phrase &quot;noun phrase(Hole 1 ,Hole2)&quot;, Holel will have the value 'trace' when a trace occurs somewhere to the right of the left end of the phrase.

Whereas head grammars provide for an account of verb fronting and cross-serial dependencies, Pereira, introducing extraposition grammars in (Pereira, 1981), is focused on displacement of noun phrases in English. $$$$$ Some questions about XGs have not been tackled in this paper.

XP -* NP While XG allows for elegant accounts of cross-serial dependencies and topicalization, it seems again hard to simultaneously account for verb and noun movement, especially if the bracketing constraint introduced in (Pereira, 1981), which requires that XG derivation graphs have a planar representation, is not relaxed. $$$$$ The computing facilities I used to experiment with XGs and to prepare this paper were made available by British Science Research Council grants.

 $$$$$ Assume the following two conventions for the drawing of a derivation graph, which are followed in all the graphs shown here: Then the derivation graph obeys the bracketing constraint if and only if it can be drawn, following the conventions, without any edges crossing.1 The example of Figure 7.2 shows this clearly.
 $$$$$ However, we will see in Section 10 that this check may be done &quot;on the fly&quot; as brackets are introduced, with a cost independent of the length of the current intermediate string in the derivation.
 $$$$$ Finally, I have been looking at what transformations should be applied to an XG developed as a clear description of a language, so that the resulting grammar could be used more efficiently in parsing.
