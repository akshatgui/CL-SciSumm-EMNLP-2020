 $$$$$ Note here an analogy to the case with qj > 0 and where pj is exactly one order of magnitude greater than qj , i.e. pj = 2 ? qj . For such a term in the standard KL divergence, we would get pj log pj qj = pj log(2) = pj . Therefore, the ? term in skew divergence implicitly defines a parameter stating how many orders of magnitude smaller than pj to count qj if qj = 0.

 $$$$$ A synset is best thought of as a concept evoked by one sense of one or more words.
