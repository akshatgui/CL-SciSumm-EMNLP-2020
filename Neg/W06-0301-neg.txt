Due to data sparseness, Kim and Hovy (2006) expand FrameNet data by using an unsupervised clustering algorithm. $$$$$ Second, some correct holders and topics which our system found were evaluated wrong even if they referred the same entities in the gold standard because human annotators marked only one of them as an answer.

Kim and Hovy (2006 ) used a FrameNet-based semantic role labeler to deter mine holder and topic of opinions. $$$$$ Unlike product reviews in which most opinions expressed in a review are likely to be opinions of the author of the review, news articles contain different opinions of different opinion holders (e.g. people, organizations, and countries).
