Building on Lin (1998), McCarthy et al (2003) measure the semantic similarity between expressions (verb particles) as a whole and their component words (verb). $$$$$ We obtained a W score of 0.594 which gives a X2 score of 196.30 for 110 degrees of freedom which is highly significant (probability of this value <= 0.000001).
