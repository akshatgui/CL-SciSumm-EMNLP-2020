[Interest] is a binary version of the word sense disambiguation data from (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ What we have just described is a method for approximating the joint distribution of all variables with a model containing only the most important systematic interactions among variables.
[Interest] is a binary version of the word sense disambiguation data from (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ The sufficient statistics are the sample counts from the highest-order marginals composed of only interdependent variables.

One set was extracted from a hand-tagged corpus (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) and the other by our algorithm. $$$$$ But decomposable models can also be characterized by directed graphs and interpreted according to the semantics of a Bayesian network ([21]; also described as &quot;recursive causal models&quot; in [27] and [16]).
One set was extracted from a hand-tagged corpus (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) and the other by our algorithm. $$$$$ In the future, we hope to develop a parametric model or models applicable to a wide range of content words and to estimate the parameters of those models from untagged data.

 $$$$$ The work that bears the closest resemblance to the work presented here is the maximum entropy approach to developing language models ([24], [25], [19] and [20]).
 $$$$$ Accessing the fit 'The marginal distributions can be represented in terms of counts or relative frequencies, depending on whether the parameters are expressed as expected frequencies or probabilities, respectively. of a model in terms of the significance of its G2 statistic gives preference to models with the fewest number of interdependencies, thereby assuring the selection of a model specifying only the most systematic variable interactions.

We also make use of these properties in formulating the empirical classifiers as described in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ [1] Baglivo, J., Olivier, D., and Pagano, M. (1992).

We also make use of these properties in formulating the empirical classifiers as described in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ The biggest limitation associated with this method is the need for large amounts of sense-tagged data.
We also make use of these properties in formulating the empirical classifiers as described in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ Unfortunately, interpreting a contextual feature that is a weighted combination of letter four-grams is difficult.

An example of the type of feature used is the part-of-speech of the word to the right; see (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) for the other ones we use. $$$$$ For example, if node a separates node b from node c in the graphical representation of a markov field, then the variables mapping to node b are conditionally independent of the variables mapping to node c given the values of the variables mapping to node a.

The Interest data set developed by Bruce and Wiebe (1994) has been previously used for WSD (Ng and Lee, 1996). $$$$$ Section 2 provides a more complete definition of the Abstract Most probabilistic classifiers used for word-sense disambiguation have either been based on only one contextual feature or have used a model that is simply assumed to characterize the interdependencies among multiple contextual features.

The next significant hand tagging task was reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), where 2,476 usages of interest were manually assigned with sense tags from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE). $$$$$ It is distributed asymptotically as X2 with degrees of freedom corresponding to the number of interactions (and/or variables) omitted from (unconstrained in) the model.

The Interest data set developed by Bruce and Wiebe (1994) has been previously used for WSD (Ng and Lee, 1996). $$$$$ This class is the set of decomposable models: models that can be expressed as a product of marginal distributions, where each marginal methodology used for formulating decomposable models and Section 3 describes the details of the case study performed to test the approach.
