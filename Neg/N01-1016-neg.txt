Work in statistically parsing conversational speech (Charniak and Johnson, 2001) has examined the performance of a parser that removes edit regions in an earlier step. $$$$$ For example, [13] uses a subsection of the ATIS corpus, takes as input the actual speech signal (and thus has access to silence duration but not to words), and uses as its evaluation metric the percentage of time the program identifies the start of the interregnum (see Section 2.2).
