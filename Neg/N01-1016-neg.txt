Work in statistically parsing conversational speech (Charniak and Johnson, 2001) has examined the performance of a parser that removes edit regions in an earlier step. $$$$$ Our best guess is that because the edit detector has high precision, and lower recall, many more words are left in the sentence to be parsed.

A study by Charniak and Johnson (2001) shows that one can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 Precision and 67 recall. $$$$$ To the degree that our fundamental assumption holds, a “real” application would ignore this last step.

Readability studies have shown that disfluencies (fillers and speech repairs) may be deleted from transcripts without compromising meaning (Jones et al, 2003), and deleting repairs prior to parsing has been shown to improve its accuracy (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ There is, of course, great room for improvement, both in stand-alone edit detectors, and their combination with parsers.

Earlier work had already made this claim regarding speech repairs and argued that there was consequently little value in syntactically analyzing repairs or evaluating our ability to do so (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Many of the variables are defined in terms of what we call a rough copy.

Based on the convention from Shriberg (1994) and Charniak and Johnson (2001), a disfluent spoken utterance is divided into three parts: the reparandum, the part that is repaired; the interregnum, which can be filler words or empty; and the repair/repeat, the part that replaces or repeats the reparandum. $$$$$ While there is a significant body of work on finding edit positions [1,9,10,13,17,18], it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between the various research efforts as they differ in (a) the corpora used for training and testing, (b) the information available to the edit detector, and (c) the evaluation metrics used.
