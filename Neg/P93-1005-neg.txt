In recent years, re-ranking techniques have been successfully used in statistical parsers to rerank the output of history-based models (Black et al, 1993). $$$$$ In addition, this paper illustrates a new approach to grammar development where the parsing problem is divided (and hopefully conquered) into two subproblems: one of grammar coverage for the grammarian to address and the other of statistical modeling to increase the probability of picking the correct parse of a sentence.

The major alternative to PCFG-based approaches are so-called history-based parsers (Black et al, 1993). $$$$$ All of these aspects of context are necessary for disambiguation, yet none is sufficient.
The major alternative to PCFG-based approaches are so-called history-based parsers (Black et al, 1993). $$$$$ This translates to about 23 parses for a 12-word sentence.
The major alternative to PCFG-based approaches are so-called history-based parsers (Black et al, 1993). $$$$$ The grammar has a significantly richer NT label set (more than 10000) than the Treebank but we have defined an equivalence mapping between the grammar NT labels and the Treebank NT labels.

Instead, the dependency tree is built stepwise and the decision about what step to take next (e.g. which dependency to insert) can be based on information about, in theory all, previous steps and their results (in the context of generative probabilistic parsing, Black et al (1993) call this the history). $$$$$ We picked the most frequent 3000 words in a corpus of 600,000 words from 10 manuals as our vocabulary.
