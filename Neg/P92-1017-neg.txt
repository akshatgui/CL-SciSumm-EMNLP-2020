For this we use an approach similar to Pereira and Schabes' grammar induction from partially bracketed text (Pereira and Schabes, 1992). $$$$$ Clearly, nonzero values for 1'(i, j) or ON, j) should only be allowed if iwi is compatible with the bracketing of w, or, equivalently, if (i, j) is valid for the bracketing of w. Therefore, we will in the following assume a corpus C of bracketed strings c = (w, B), and will modify the standard formulas for the inside and outside probabilities and rule probability reestimation (Baker, 1979; Lan i and Young, 1990; Jelinek et al., 1990) to involve only constituents whose spans are compatible with string bracketings.

The role of supervision is to permit some constituents to be built but not others (Pereira and Schabes, 1992). $$$$$ While none of this is very surprising, it supplies some support for the view that purely unsupervised, self-organizing grammar inference methods may have difficulty in distinguishing between underlying grammatical structure and contingent distributional regularities, or, to put it in another way, it gives some evidence for the importance of nondistributional regularities in language, which in the case of bracketed training have been supplied indirectly by the linguists carrying out the bracketing.
The role of supervision is to permit some constituents to be built but not others (Pereira and Schabes, 1992). $$$$$ A bracketing B of a string w is a finite set of spans on w (that is, a finite set of pairs or integers (i, j) with 0 < i < j < lwl) satisfying a consistency condition that ensures that each span (i, j) can be seen as delimiting a string iwi consisting of a sequence of one of more.
