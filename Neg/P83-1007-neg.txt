 $$$$$ In contrast. centering refers to a more local focusing process, one relates to identifying the single entity that an individual utterance most centrally concerns (Sidner, 1979; Joshi and Weinstein, 19811.
 $$$$$ To illustrate the integration of factors in explaining the uses of referring expressions, their use on one of these levels, i.e., the local one, is discussed in Sections 3 and 4.

 $$$$$ Discourses were shown to be coherent at two different levels, i.e., with referring expressions used to identify entities that are centered locally and those focused upon more globally.
 $$$$$ In particular, for sentences containing noun In 3 hiller treatment of our theory we will consider centers that are realized by constituents in other syntactic categories.
 $$$$$ The two levels of discourse coherence correspond to two levels of focusingâ€”global focusing and centering.

Grosz et al (1983) proposed the centering model which is concerned with the interactions between the local coherence of discourse. $$$$$ In our theory, the centers of a sentence in a discourse serve to integrate that sentence into the discourse.

Grosz et al (1983) proposed the centering model which is concerned with the interactions between the local coherence of discourse. $$$$$ The differences between references at the global and local levels were discussed, and the interaction of the syntactic role of a given noun phrase and its semantic interpretation with centering was described.

The proposed method employs contextual features based on centering theory (Grosz et al, 1983) as well as conventional syntactic and word-based features. $$$$$ Linguistic theories typically assign various linguistic phenomena to one of the categories, syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic, as if the phenomena in each category were relatively independent of those in the others.
The proposed method employs contextual features based on centering theory (Grosz et al, 1983) as well as conventional syntactic and word-based features. $$$$$ If we understand the semantic denotation of a description to be the unique object that satisfies the content of the description, if there is one, then Barwise and Perry would allow that there are referential uses of a description D that contribute objects other than the semantic denotation of D to the propositions expressed by uses of sentences in which D occurs.
The proposed method employs contextual features based on centering theory (Grosz et al, 1983) as well as conventional syntactic and word-based features. $$$$$ In such cases, additional inferences 10Obviously, if Cb(S) is not expressed in the next sentence then this issue does not arise. are required to determine that the pronoun does not refer to the current center, as well as to identify the context back to which attention is shifting.
The proposed method employs contextual features based on centering theory (Grosz et al, 1983) as well as conventional syntactic and word-based features. $$$$$ The main purpose of the paper was to sort out the confusion about the roles of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors in the interpretation and generation of definite noun phrases in discourse.

To resolve referring expression, one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (Grosz et al (1983)). $$$$$ We have said that each utterance S in a discourse has associated with it a backward-looking center, Cb(S), and a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(S).
To resolve referring expression, one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (Grosz et al (1983)). $$$$$ In Section 5 we define center more precisely, show how it relates to Sidner's [19811 immediate focus and potential foci, and discuss how the linkages established by the centers of a sentence help to determine the degree of intelligibility of a discourse.
To resolve referring expression, one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (Grosz et al (1983)). $$$$$ The realization relation is neither semantic nor pragmatic.
To resolve referring expression, one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (Grosz et al (1983)). $$$$$ It depends on such things as the syntactic structure of an utterance, ellipsis, and the use of pronominal referring expressions 1Sidner, 19811.
