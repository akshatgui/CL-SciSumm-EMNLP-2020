Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) used a similar data structure in their rule-based method. $$$$$ After reanalysis of the CS, the analysis returns to the reduction of a sentence by checking the relations between all pairs of CSs.
Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) used a similar data structure in their rule-based method. $$$$$ The third step of our syntactic analysis is a very common operation.
Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) used a similar data structure in their rule-based method. $$$$$ Although one-third of the dependency structures after this analysis process included some errors, their major structures, that is, their conjunctive structures and basic dependency structures, were detected correctly in most cases.
Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) used a similar data structure in their rule-based method. $$$$$ A serious problem concerning conjunctive structures, besides the ambiguity of their scopes, is the ellipsis of some of their components.

Popular parsers are Cabo Cha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), which we redeveloped to analyze formal written language expressions such as that in newspaper articles. $$$$$ However, two high SL bunsetsus corresponding to each other often exist in a CS, and these do not limit the scope of the CS, like &quot;X TO-SHITE WA(As to X), ... DE-ARI(be), Y TO-SHITE WA(as to Y), .

Sentences with coordinate structures are also difficult to parse (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). $$$$$ This is realized using a dynamic programming technique.
Sentences with coordinate structures are also difficult to parse (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). $$$$$ Consequently, the total dependency structure of a sentence can be obtained by relatively simple head-dependent rules.

Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) proposed a method to detect conjunctive structures by calculating similarity scores between two sequences of bunsetsus. $$$$$ We also call &quot;enjoyed the book&quot; pre-conjunct, and &quot;liked the play&quot; post-conjunct.
Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) proposed a method to detect conjunctive structures by calculating similarity scores between two sequences of bunsetsus. $$$$$ Since two or more conjunctive structures sometimes exist in a sentence with very complex interrelations, the second step is to adjust tangled relations that may exist between two or more conjunctive structures in the sentence.

If the current modifier bunsetsu is a distinctive key bunsetsu (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994, page 510), these features are triggered. $$$$$ This paper presents a syntactic analysis method that first detects conjunctive structures in a sentence by checking parallelism of two series of words and then analyzes the dependency structure of the sentence with the help of the information about the conjunctive structures.
If the current modifier bunsetsu is a distinctive key bunsetsu (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994, page 510), these features are triggered. $$$$$ In the sentence in Figure 7, the bunsetsu &quot;SONO(the),&quot; which can depend on &quot;KANOUSEI-WO(possibility),&quot; is regarded as contained in the CS, but the bunsetsu &quot;KAISHOU-SURU-TAME-NI-WA(in order to solve),&quot; which accompanies &quot;WA&quot; and a comma, is not contained in the CS, and the extension of the CS thus ends here.
If the current modifier bunsetsu is a distinctive key bunsetsu (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994, page 510), these features are triggered. $$$$$ In English, conversely, the phrase following the conjunction is the posthead, and the pre-head is searched for in the same way (Agarwal and Boggess 1992).
If the current modifier bunsetsu is a distinctive key bunsetsu (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994, page 510), these features are triggered. $$$$$ An appropriate similarity value between two bunsetsus is given by the following process: Hyou (BGH; National Language Research Institute 1964).

 $$$$$ Another serious problem regarding CSs, in addition to the ambiguity of scope, is the ellipses that may occur in the components of CSs.
 $$$$$ When the same modifiers exist in both conjuncts, the modifiers in its postconjunct are often omitted (Figures 14a and 14b).
 $$$$$ When the extension operation is performed on the pre-conjunct of a CS that is a strong CS, we recover the omitted modifiers by interpreting a bunsetsu that depends on a bunsetsu (B1) in its pre-conjunct as also depending on the bunsetsu (131) in its post-conjunct corresponding to B, (Figure 14d) (we think B, corresponds to B1 when the path specifying these conjuncts contains an element a(i,j)).

The state space of our model resembles that of Kurohashi and Nagao's Japanese coordination detection method (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). $$$$$ As for the sentence in Figure 8, the following CSs are detected: Because CSI and CS2 are found to be in a brother relation by checking their overlap relation, they are merged into one CS (CSI-2: [HYOUDAI(a tit/e),HCHOSHA(an author),]- [SHUDAI-NADO-NO(such as a theme)]).

while Sassano (2004) used richer features which are not used in the proposed method, such as features for conjunctive structures based on Kurohashi and Nagao (1994). $$$$$ The third type is a CS consisting of parts of conjunctive predicative clauses.
while Sassano (2004) used richer features which are not used in the proposed method, such as features for conjunctive structures based on Kurohashi and Nagao (1994). $$$$$ Therefore, we have developed an algorithm for calculating a similarity measure between two arbitrary series of words from the left and the right of a conjunction and selecting the two most similar series of words that can reasonably be considered as composing a conjunctive structure.
while Sassano (2004) used richer features which are not used in the proposed method, such as features for conjunctive structures based on Kurohashi and Nagao (1994). $$$$$ The second type is the conjunctive predicative clause, in which two or more predicates in a sentence form a coordination.
