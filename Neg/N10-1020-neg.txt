Recent studies have also developed approaches to summarize conversations (Murray and Carenini, 2008) and to model conversation structures (dialogue acts) from online Twitter conversations (Ritter et al, 2010). $$$$$ Given the infrastructure necessary for the Conversation+Topic model described above, it is straightforward to also implement a Bayesian version of of the conversation model described in Section 3.1.

Ritter et al (2010) extends LMHMM to allow words to be emitted from two additional sources: the topic of current dialogue, or a background LM shared across all dialogues. $$$$$ To collect this corpus, we crawled Twitter using its publicly available API.
