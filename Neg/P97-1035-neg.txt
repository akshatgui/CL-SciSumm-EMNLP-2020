Instead, predictions about user satisfaction can be made on the basis of the predictor variables, which is illustrated in the application of PARADISE to sub dialogues in (Walker et al., 1997). $$$$$ We believe that the framework is also applicable to other dialogue modalities, and to human-human task-oriented dialogues.

While we discussed the representation of an information-seeking dialogue here, AVM representations for negotiation and diagnostic dialogue tasks are also easily constructed (Walker et al, 1997). $$$$$ The repair utterance in Figure 3 is U2, but note that according to the AVM task tagging, U2 simultaneously addresses the information goals for depart-range.

The first approach to predict user judgments on the basis of interaction metrics is the well-known PARADISE model (Walker et al, 1997). $$$$$ These approaches are also limited in that they currently do not calculate performance over subdialogues as well as whole dialogues, correlate performance with an external validation criterion, or normalize performance for task complexity.

Walker et al (1997) identified three factors which carry an influence on the performance of SDSs, and which therefore are thought to contribute to its quality perceived by the user $$$$$ The use of decision theory requires a specification of both the objectives of the decision problem and a set of measures (known as attributes in decision theory) for operationalizing the objectives.

The PARADISE framework (Walker et al, 1997) produces such a relationship for a specific scenario, using multivariate linear regression. $$$$$ The remainder of this section explains the measures (ovals in Figure 1) used to operationalize the set of objectives, and the methodology for estimating a quantitative performance function that reflects the objective structure.

As stated above, the separation of environmental, agent and task factors was motivated by Walker et al (1997). $$$$$ The framework decouples task requirements from an agent's dialogue behaviors, supports comparisons among dialogue strategies, enables the calculation of performance over subdialogues and whole dialogues, specifies the relative contribution of various factors to performance, and makes it possible to compare agents performing different tasks by normalizing for task complexity.

Previous studies (E.g., Walker et al, 1997) use a corpus level semantic accuracy measure (semantic Accuracy) to capture the system's understanding ability. $$$$$ The PARADISE performance measure is a function of both task success (K) and dialogue costs (ci), and has a number of advantages.

Once they had completed all tasks in sequence using one system, they filled out a questionnaire to assess user satisfaction by rating 8-9 statements, similar to those in (Walker et al, 1997), on a scale of 1-5, where 5 indicated highest satisfaction. $$$$$ The framework decouples task requirements from an agent's dialogue behaviors, supports comparisons among dialogue strategies, enables the calculation of performance over subdialogues and whole dialogues, specifies the relative contribution of various factors to performance, and makes it possible to compare agents performing different tasks by normalizing for task complexity.

Following the PARADISE evaluation scheme (Walker et al, 1997), we divided performance features into four groups. $$$$$ Consider a comparison of two train timetable information agents (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995), where Agent A in Dialogue 1 uses an explicit confirmation strategy, while Agent B in Dialogue 2 uses an implicit confirmation strategy: Danieli and Gerbino found that Agent A had a higher transaction success rate and produced less inappropriate and repair utterances than Agent B, and thus concluded that Agent A was more robust than Agent B.

Some studies (e.g., (Walker et al, 1997)) build regression models to predict user satisfaction scores from the system log as well as the user survey. $$$$$ PARADISE uses a decision-theoretic framework to specify the relative contribution of various factors to an agent's overall performance.

They then derived dialogue act metrics from the DATE tags and showed that when these metrics were used in the PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al, 1997) that they improved models of user satisfaction by an absolute 5%, and that the new metrics could be used to understand which system's dialogue strategies were most effective. $$$$$ PARADISE supports comparisons among dialogue strategies by providing a task representation that decouples what an agent needs to achieve in terms of the task requirements from how the agent carries out the task via dialogue.

Such metrics have been introduced in other fields, including PARADISE (Walker et al, 1997) for spoken dialogue systems, BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) for machine translation, and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) for summarisation. $$$$$ Smith and Gordon collected 144 dialogues for this task, in which agent initiative was varied by using different dialogue strategies, and tagged each dialogue according to the following subtask structure:13 Our informational analysis of this task results in the AVM shown in Table 7.

In particular, unlike the PARADISE framework (Walker et al, 1997), which aims to evaluate dialogue agent strategies by relating overall user satisfaction to various other metrics (task success, efficiency measures, and qualitative measures) our approach takes the agent's dialogue strategy for granted. $$$$$ Note that the attributes are almost identical to Smith and Gordon's list of subtasks.

Previous work has therefore suggested to learn a reward function from human data as in the PARADISE framework (Walker et al, 1997). $$$$$ The repair utterances in Figure 2 are A3 through U6, thus c2(D1) is 10 utterances and c2(S4) is 2 utterances.
