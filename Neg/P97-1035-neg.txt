Instead, predictions about user satisfaction can be made on the basis of the predictor variables, which is illustrated in the application of PARADISE to sub dialogues in (Walker et al., 1997). $$$$$ In addition, only data from comparable strategies can be used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for normalization.

While we discussed the representation of an information-seeking dialogue here, AVM representations for negotiation and diagnostic dialogue tasks are also easily constructed (Walker et al, 1997). $$$$$ PARADISE represents each cost measure as a function ci that can be applied to any (sub)dialogue.

The first approach to predict user judgments on the basis of interaction metrics is the well-known PARADISE model (Walker et al, 1997). $$$$$ Second, because our success measure K takes into account the complexity of the task, comparisons can be made across dialogue tasks.

Walker et al (1997) identified three factors which carry an influence on the performance of SDSs, and which therefore are thought to contribute to its quality perceived by the user: agent factors (mainly related to the dialogue and the system itself), task factors (related to how the SDS captures the task it has been developed for) and environmental factors (e.g. factors related to the acoustic environment and the transmission channel). $$$$$ The framework decouples task requirements from an agent's dialogue behaviors, supports comparisons among dialogue strategies, enables the calculation of performance over subdialogues and whole dialogues, specifies the relative contribution of various factors to performance, and makes it possible to compare agents performing different tasks by normalizing for task complexity.

The PARADISE framework (Walker et al, 1997) produces such a relationship for a specific scenario, using multivariate linear regression. $$$$$ An agent's responses to a query are compared with a predefined key of minimum and maximum reference answers; performance is the proportion of responses that match the key.

As stated above, the separation of environmental, agent and task factors was motivated by Walker et al (1997). $$$$$ In addition to the use of decision theory to create this objective structure, other novel aspects of PARADISE include the use of the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996; Siegel and Castellan, 1988) to operationalize task success, and the use of linear regression to quantify the relative contribution of the success and cost factors to user satisfaction.
As stated above, the separation of environmental, agent and task factors was motivated by Walker et al (1997). $$$$$ In some cases it might be desirable to calculate ic first for identification of attributes and then for values within attributes, or to average ic for each attribute to produce an overall ic for the task.

As stated above, the separation of environmental, agent and task factors was motivated by Walker et al (1997). $$$$$ As we have demonstrated here, any dialogue strategy can be evaluated, so it should be possible to show that a cooperative response, or other cooperative strategy, actually improves task performance by reducing costs or increasing task success.

In the PARADISE framework, user satisfaction is composed of maximal task success and minimal dialogue costs (Walker et al, 1997), thus a type of efficiency in the way it was defined here. $$$$$ This paper presents PARADISE (PARAdigm for DIalogue System Evaluation), a general framework for evaluating spoken rlialogue agents.

In the PARADISE framework, user satisfaction is composed of maximal task success and minimal dialogue costs (Walker et al, 1997), thus a type of efficiency in the way it was defined here. $$$$$ In addition, this approach is broadly integrative, incorporating aspects of transaction success, concept accuracy, multiple cost measures, and user satisfaction.

User satisfaction is a function of task success and the number of user turns based on the PARADISE framework (Walker et al, 1997) and CAS refers to the proportion of repetition and variation in surface forms. $$$$$ Since performance can be measured over any subtask, and since dialogue strategies can range over subdialogues or the whole dialogue, we can associate performance with individual dialogue strategies.

Previous studies (E.g., Walker et al, 1997) use a corpus level semantic accuracy measure (semantic Accuracy) to capture the system's understanding ability. $$$$$ Performance is modeled as a weighted function of a task-based success measure and dialogue-based cost measures, where weights are computed by correlating user satisfaction with performance.

Following the PARADISE evaluation scheme (Walker et al, 1997), we divided performance features into four groups. $$$$$ Another possibility is to simply substitute a domain-specific task-based success measure in the performance model for K. The evaluation model presented here has many applications in apoken dialogue processing.

They then derived dialogue act metrics from the DATE tags and showed that when these metrics were used in the PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al, 1997) that they improved models of user satisfaction by an absolute 5%, and that the new metrics could be used to understand which system's dialogue strategies were most effective. $$$$$ The value of RT in the AVM instantiation for the dialogue would be &quot;reserve?'

Such metrics have been introduced in other fields, including PARADISE (Walker et al, 1997) for spoken dialogue systems, BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) for machine translation, and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) for summarisation. $$$$$ PARADISE supports comparisons among dialogue strategies with a task representation that decouples what an agent needs to achieve in terms of the task requirements from how the agent carries out the task via dialogue.

In particular, unlike the PARADISE framework (Walker et al, 1997), which aims to evaluate dialogue agent strategies by relating overall user satisfaction to various other metrics (task success, efficiency measures, and qualitative measures) our approach takes the agent's dialogue strategy for granted. $$$$$ Performance evaluation for an agent requires a corpus of dialogues between users and the agent, in which users execute a set of scenarios.
