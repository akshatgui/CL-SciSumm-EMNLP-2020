Therefore, we use an Earley-style probabilistic parser, which outputs Viterbi parses (Stolcke, 1995). $$$$$ For example, let X have productions The semantics of context-free rules imply that X can only expand to E if all the RHS nonterminals in one of X's productions expand to E. Translating to probabilities, we obtain the equation In other words, each production contributes a term in which the rule probability is multiplied by the product of the e variables corresponding to the RHS nonterminals, unless the RHS contains a terminal (in which case the production contributes nothing to ex because it cannot possibly lead to E).
