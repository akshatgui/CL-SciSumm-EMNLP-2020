Recently, Toutanova et al (2003) presented a supervised conditional Markov Model part-of-speech tagger (CMM) which exploited information coming from both left and right contexts. $$$$$ Secondly, while all taggers use lexical information, and, indeed, it is well-known that lexical probabilities are much more revealing than tag sequence probabilities (Charniak et al., 1993), most taggers make quite limited use of lexical probabilities (compared with, for example, the bilexical probabilities commonly used in current statistical parsers).
Recently, Toutanova et al (2003) presented a supervised conditional Markov Model part-of-speech tagger (CMM) which exploited information coming from both left and right contexts. $$$$$ We present a new part-of-speech tagger that demonstrates the following ideas: (i) explicit use of both preceding and following tag contexts via a dependency network representation, (ii) broad use of lexical features, including jointly conditioning on multiple consecutive words, (iii) effective use of priors in conditional loglinear models, and (iv) fine-grained modeling of unknown word features.

The algorithms were trained and tested using version 3 of the Penn Treebank, using the training, development, and test split described in Collins (2002) and also employed by Toutanova et al (2003) in testing their supervised tagging algorithm. $$$$$ We present a new part-of-speech tagger that demonstrates the following ideas: (i) explicit use of both preceding and following tag contexts via a dependency network representation, (ii) broad use of lexical features, including jointly conditioning on multiple consecutive words, (iii) effective use of priors in conditional loglinear models, and (iv) fine-grained modeling of unknown word features.

The algorithms were trained and tested using version 3 of the Penn Treebank, using the training, development, and test split described in Collins (2002) and also employed by Toutanova et al (2003) in testing their supervised tagging algorithm. $$$$$ For example, in a left-to-right first-order HMM, the current tag t0 is predicted based on the previous tag t_1 (and the current word).1 The backward interaction between t0 and the next tag t+1 shows up implicitly later, when t+1 is generated in turn.

In the future, we will consider making an increase the context-size, which helped Toutanova et al (2003). $$$$$ Regardless of whether one is using HMMs, maximum entropy conditional sequence models, or other techniques like decision trees, most systems work in one direction through the sequence (normally left to right, but occasionally right to left, e.g., Church (1988)).

We use the Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003) to tokenize and POS tag English and German sentences. $$$$$ While unidirectional models are therefore able to capture both directions of influence, there are good reasons for suspecting that it would be advantageous to make information from both directions explicitly available for conditioning at each local point in the model: (i) because of smoothing and interactions with other modeled features, terms like P(t0|t+1, ...) might give a sharp estimate of t0 even when terms like P(t+1|t0, ...) do not, and (ii) jointly considering the left and right context together might be especially revealing.

We then obtain their POS N-grams from the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al 2003), and count how many of them have the POS N-gram. $$$$$ Finally, the fact that the measure has much more dynamic range has some appeal when reporting tagging results.
We then obtain their POS N-grams from the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al 2003), and count how many of them have the POS N-gram. $$$$$ Indeed, the result of Collins (2002) that including low support features helps a voted perceptron model but harms a maximum entropy model is undone once the weights of the maximum entropy model are regularized.
