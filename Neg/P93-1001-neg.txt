The program takes the output of char_align (Church, 1993), a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs, and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown el al.'s Model 2 (Brown et al, 1993), modified and extended to deal with robustness issues. $$$$$ Thus, low frequency tokens (e.g., content words) contribute more to the dotplot than high frequency tokens (e.g., function words).

 $$$$$ On clean inputs, such as the Canadian Hansards, these methods have been very successful (at least 96% correct by sentence).
 $$$$$ It should not be surprising that the error rates are roughly comparable, ±46 and ±57 bytes, respectively.

Church (1993) uses 4-grams at the level of character sequences. $$$$$ Char_align has succeeded in meeting many of these goals because it works at the character level and does not depend on finding sentence and/or paragraph boundaries which are surprisingly elusive in realistic applications.
Church (1993) uses 4-grams at the level of character sequences. $$$$$ This is especially true for historically related language pairs such as English and French, which share quite a number of cognates, e.g., government and gouvernement, though it also holds fairly well for almost any language pair that makes use of the Roman alphabet since there will usually be a fair number of proper nouns (e.g., surnames, company names, place names) and numbers (e.g., dates, times) that will be nearly the same in the two texts.

Using lexical information, Kenneth Church (1993) showed that cheap alignment of text segments was still possible exploiting orthographic cognates (Michel Simard et al, 1992), instead of sentence delimiters. $$$$$ First, as suggested above, the dotplot is actually stored in rotated coordinates, with a limited resolution, r, and band limited between B min and Bn,a,, .

We use the text Dotplotting representation by (Church, 1993) and plot the cosine similarity scores between every pair of sentences in the text. $$$$$ Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknown markup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to find boundaries, let alone sentences.

Simard and Plamondon (Simard and Plamondon, 1998) used a composite method in which the first pass does alignment at the level of characters asin (Church, 1993) (itself based on cognate matching) and the second pass uses IBM Model-1, following Chen (Chen, 1993). $$$$$ The final step is to find the best path of dots.

 $$$$$ Various signal processing techniques are used to compress dotplots for large Nx+Ny.
 $$$$$ This weighting improves the quality of the results, but more importantly, it makes it possible to save time by ignoring the less important dots (e.g., those corresponding to tokens with a frequency greater than 100).
 $$$$$ And even if they are available in electronic form, it may not be worth the effort to clean them up by hand.

In previous work (Church et al 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using char align (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target. $$$$$ Because of the noise issues, we decided to look for an alternative to paragraph—based alignment methods.

Currently ,word_align depends on char align (Church, 1993) to generate a starting point, which limits its applicability to European languages since char_align was designed for language pairs that share a common alphabet. $$$$$ It also favors shorter paths over longer paths.
Currently ,word_align depends on char align (Church, 1993) to generate a starting point, which limits its applicability to European languages since char_align was designed for language pairs that share a common alphabet. $$$$$ In principle, the dotplot could be computed by simply iterating through all pairs of positions in the two input files, x and y, and testing whether the 4—gram of characters in text x starting at position i are the same as the 4—gram of characters in text y starting at position j.

Levenshtein measure (Levenshtein, 1966) Church (1993) employs a method that induces sentence alignment by employing cognates (words that are spelled similarly across languages). $$$$$ While pursuing this possibility with a commercial translation organization, AT&T Language Line Services, we discovered that we needed to completely redesign our alignment programs in order to deal more effectively with texts supplied by AT&T Language Line's customers in whatever format they happen to be available in.
