 $$$$$ That is, we would like to allocate the dotplot array with a width of w=Ni+Ny and a height of h=B +B.
 $$$$$ A sub— optimal heuristic search (with forward pruning) is used to find the path with the largest average weight.
 $$$$$ Parallel texts could be used to help translators overcome their lack of domain expertise by providing them with the ability to search previously translated documents for examples of potentially difficult expressions and see how they were translated in the past.
 $$$$$ These heuristics are necessary for space considerations.

The work by Simard, Foster and Isabelle (1993) as well as Church (1993) demonstrated that cognate-matching strategies can be highly effective in aligning text. $$$$$ Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknown markup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to find boundaries, let alone sentences.

Using lexical information, Kenneth Church (1993) showed that cheap alignment of text segments was still possible exploiting orthographic cognates (Michel Simard et al, 1992), instead of sentence delimiters. $$$$$ In principle, the dotplot could be computed by simply iterating through all pairs of positions in the two input files, x and y, and testing whether the 4—gram of characters in text x starting at position i are the same as the 4—gram of characters in text y starting at position j.

We use the text Dotplotting representation by (Church, 1993) and plot the cosine similarity scores between every pair of sentences in the text. $$$$$ Char_align has succeeded in meeting many of these goals because it works at the character level and does not depend on finding sentence and/or paragraph boundaries which are surprisingly elusive in realistic applications.

Simard and Plamondon (Simard and Plamondon, 1998) used a composite method in which the first pass does alignment at the level of characters asin (Church, 1993) (itself based on cognate matching) and the second pass uses IBM Model-1, following Chen (Chen, 1993). $$$$$ Figure 8 shows a dotplot of 3 years of Canadian Hansards (37 million words) in English and French, tokenized by words.

 $$$$$ For this application, it is necessary that the alignment program accept noisy (realistic) input, e.g., raw OCR output, with little or no manual cleanup.
 $$$$$ That is, each candidate path is scored by the sum of the weights along the path, divided by the length of the path, and the candidate path with the best score is returned.

In previous work (Church et al 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using char align (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target. $$$$$ Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknown markup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to find boundaries, let alone sentences.
