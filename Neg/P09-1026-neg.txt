Following (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), stance, as used in this work, refers to an overall position held by a person toward an object, idea or proposition. $$$$$ This result suggests that not all terms that are relevant to a topic are useful for determining the debate side.
Following (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), stance, as used in this work, refers to an overall position held by a person toward an object, idea or proposition. $$$$$ In addition to expressing positive sentiments about one’s preference, a key strategy is also to express negative sentiments about the other side.
Following (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), stance, as used in this work, refers to an overall position held by a person toward an object, idea or proposition. $$$$$ While debating, participants often refer to and acknowledge the viewpoints of the opposing side.
Following (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009), stance, as used in this work, refers to an overall position held by a person toward an object, idea or proposition. $$$$$ However, our approach is novel in that it learns and exploits associations among opinion/polarity, topics, and aspects.

Our work is also different from related work in the domain of product debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) in terms of the methodology. $$$$$ We implemented two baselines: the OpTopic system that uses topic information only, and the OpPMI system that uses topic as well as related word (noun) information.
Our work is also different from related work in the domain of product debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) in terms of the methodology. $$$$$ Theirs is a supervised bag-of-words system using unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as features.
Our work is also different from related work in the domain of product debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) in terms of the methodology. $$$$$ Some of the errors are due to the fact that the opinions expressed in the post are pragmatic.
Our work is also different from related work in the domain of product debates (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) in terms of the methodology. $$$$$ We use straightforward methods, as these tasks are not the focus of this paper.

Some previous research looked at the related field of opinion mining, also on political discussion, as in (AbuJbara et al, 2012), (Anand et al., 2011) or (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009). $$$$$ Finally, while other opinion analysis systems have considered discourse information, they have not distinguished between concessionary and non-concessionary opinions when determining the overall stance of a document.

As we aim at performing a finegrained analysis, approaches merely classifying pro or contra (like those of (Walker et al, 2012) or (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) are not applicable in our case. $$$$$ Table 2 contains examples of the learned probabilities.

Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) propose an unsupervised method for classifying the stance of each contribution to an on line debate concerning the merits of competing products. $$$$$ This research was supported in part by the Department of Homeland Security under grant N000140710152.

Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) propose an unsupervised method for classifying the stance of each contribution to an on line debate concerning the merits of competing products. $$$$$ Some work in product review mining finds aspects of a central topic, and summarizes opinions with respect to these aspects.
Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) propose an unsupervised method for classifying the stance of each contribution to an on line debate concerning the merits of competing products. $$$$$ This knowledge is exploited in an unsupervised method for classifying the side taken by a post, which also accounts for concessionary opinions.

Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) presents an unsupervised opinion analysis method for debate-side classification. $$$$$ Not all aspects associated with a topic are discriminative with respect to stance; we hypothesized that, by including polarity, we would be more likely to find useful associations.
Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) presents an unsupervised opinion analysis method for debate-side classification. $$$$$ This information is employed, in conjunction with discourse information, in an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework.

There have been some related works that focus on discovering the general topics and ideological perspectives in online discussions (Ahmed and Xing, 2010), placing users in support/oppose camps (Agarwal et al, 2003), and classifying user stances (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009). $$$$$ We do not exploit comparative constructs, but rather probabilistic associations.

 $$$$$ False lexicon hits.

 $$$$$ We combine this knowledge with discourse information, and formulate the debate side classification task as an Integer Linear Programming problem.
 $$$$$ The polarity-topic pairs are counted for each debate side according to the following equations.

 $$$$$ Pragmatic opinions.
 $$$$$ This paper addresses challenges faced by opinion analysis in the debate genre.
 $$$$$ This becomes a problem especially when the debate post is small, and we have few other lexical clues in the post.
 $$$$$ Finally, both of the OpPr systems are better than both baselines in Accuracy as well as F-measure for all four debates.

Sentence 14 is a negative pragmatic opinion (Somasundaran and Wiebe, 2009) which can only be detected with the help of external world knowledge. $$$$$ This research was supported in part by the Department of Homeland Security under grant N000140710152.

Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) used unsupervised methods to identify stances in online debates. $$$$$ In the second sentence, the lexicon does hit the word “worth,” and, using syntactic rules, we can determine it is negated.
Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) used unsupervised methods to identify stances in online debates. $$$$$ The above phenomenon gives rise to an additional problem: often, conflicting sides (and topics) are addressed within the same post, sometimes within the same sentence.
Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) used unsupervised methods to identify stances in online debates. $$$$$ Our hypothesis that addressing concessionary opinions is useful is also corroborated by improved performance.
