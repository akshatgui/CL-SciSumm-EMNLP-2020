Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see Litkowski, 2004 for more details). $$$$$ A worthy objective for the Senseval community is the development of a wide range of methods for automating frame semantics, specifically identifying and labeling semantic roles in sentences.

Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see Litkowski, 2004 for more details). $$$$$ Since a considerable portion of a sense inventory has only a single sense, the question has been raised whether the amount of effort required by disambiguation is worthwhile.

Although the strict measures are more interesting, we include these figures for comparison with the systems participating in the Senseval-3 Restricted task (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ The collective efforts of the participants have contributed greatly to making this complex database more accessible and more amenable to even further development, not only for research purposes, but also for use in many NLP applications.

Although the strict measures are more interesting, we include these figures for comparison with the systems participating in the Senseval-3 Restricted task (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ The task was based on the considerable expansion of the FrameNet data since the baseline study of automatic labeling of semantic roles by Gildea and Jurafsky.

This task is a more advanced and realistic version of the Automatic Semantic Role Labeling task of Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ The average precision over all these runs is 0.803 and the average recall is 0.757.
This task is a more advanced and realistic version of the Automatic Semantic Role Labeling task of Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ The FrameNet project (Johnson et al., 2003) has put together a body of hand-labeled data and the Gildea and Jurafsky study has put together a set of suitable metrics for evaluating the performance of an automatic system.

Noun predicates also appear in FrameNet semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and many FrameNet SRL systems are evaluated in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ The FrameNet data provide an extensive body of “gold standard” data that can be used in lexical semantics research, as the basis for its further exploitation in NLP applications.
Noun predicates also appear in FrameNet semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and many FrameNet SRL systems are evaluated in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ Systems were allowed to return any number of frame elements for a sentence and it is possible for a system to identify more frame elements than were identified by the FrameNet taggers.

The same problem was again highlighted by the results obtained with and without the frame information in the Senseval-3 competition (Litkowski,2004) of FrameNet (Johnson et al, 2003) role labeling task. $$$$$ The effect of a higher number attempted lowers the precision for a run and increases the percent attempted.
The same problem was again highlighted by the results obtained with and without the frame information in the Senseval-3 competition (Litkowski,2004) of FrameNet (Johnson et al, 2003) role labeling task. $$$$$ The FrameNet project has just released a major revision (FrameNet 1.1) to its database, with 487 frames using 696 distinctly-named frame elements (although it is not guaranteed that frame elements with the same name have the same meaning).

Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see (Litkowski, 2004) for more details). $$$$$ In view of the fact that the number of frames and frame elements in FrameNet has expanded considerably since the Gildea and Jurafsky study, it appears that the methods employed have become quite accurate in classifying constituents.5 Results for the restricted were also quite good in comparison with the Gildea and Jurafsky study, which achieved 65% precision and 61% recall at the “more difficult task of simultaneously segmenting constituents and identifying their semantic role.” In this task, four teams achieved results between 80 and 90 percent for precision and between 65 and 78 percent for recall.

This task has been the subject of a previous Senseval task (Automatic Semantic Role Labeling, Litkowski (2004)) and two shared tasks on semantic role labeling in the Conference on Natural Language Learning (Carreras Marquez (2004) and Carreras Marquez (2005)). $$$$$ Participants used a wide variety of techniques, investigating many aspects of the FrameNet data.

Beginning with work by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), there has been a large interest in semantic role labelling, as evidenced by its adoption as a shared task in the Senseval-III competition (FrameNet data, Litkowski, 2004) and at the CoNLL-2004 and 2005 conference (PropBank data, Carreras and Mrquez, 2005). $$$$$ Precision was computed as the number of correct answers divided by the number attempted.
