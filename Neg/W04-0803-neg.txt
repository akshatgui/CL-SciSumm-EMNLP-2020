Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see Litkowski, 2004 for more details). $$$$$ The correct answer for this case, based on the tagging, is as follows: Motion.1087911 Theme (82,88) Path (0,0) Participants were instructed to identify null instantiations in submissions by giving a (0,0) value for the frame element’s position.2 Participants were told in the task description that null instantiations would be analyzed separately.3 For this Senseval task, participants were allowed to download the training data at any time; the 21-day restriction on submission of results after downloading the training data was waived since this is a new Senseval task and the dataset is very complex.

Although the strict measures are more interesting, we include these figures for comparison with the systems participating in the Senseval-3 Restricted task (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ Precision was computed as the number of correct answers divided by the number attempted.

Noun predicates also appear in FrameNet semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and many FrameNet SRL systems are evaluated in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004). $$$$$ Discussions among participants during development of the task and the scoring of their runs contributed to a successful task.

The same problem was again highlighted by the results obtained with and without the frame information in the Senseval-3 competition (Litkowski,2004) of FrameNet (Johnson et al, 2003) role labeling task. $$$$$ In addition, however, the scoring program required that the frame boundaries identified by the system’s answer had to overlap with the boundaries identified by FrameNet.
