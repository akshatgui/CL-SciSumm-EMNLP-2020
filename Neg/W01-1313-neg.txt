These numbers compare favorably with the previous literature: (Filatova and Hovy 2001) obtained 82% accuracy on anchoring for a single type of event/topic on 172 clauses, while (Mani and Wilson 2000) obtained accuracy of 59.4% on anchoring over 663 verb contexts. $$$$$ The output of the presented system gives the information about the timeorder of the events described in several documents.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) also explore temporal linking with events, but do not assume that events and time stamps have been provided by an external process. $$$$$ The hypothesis that the noncanonical news format does adversely affect understanding is a reasonable one on the basis of comprehension research into other narrative genres, but the degree to which familiarity with news models may mitigate these problems is unclear”.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) also explore temporal linking with events, but do not assume that events and time stamps have been provided by an external process. $$$$$ There are no such clauses in the analyzed data, so we ignore this complication for the present.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ In this case we ask the user to insert the time for this reference event manually.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ Such a text where all the events are organized in a chronological order might be very helpful in multidocument summarization, where it is important to include into the final summary not only the most important information but also the most recent one.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ After stamping all the news stories from the analyzed set, we arrange the event-clauses from all the articles into a chronological order.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit temporal expressions within a text and apply this information throughout the whole article, assigning activity times to all clauses. $$$$$ Evaluations show a performance of 52%, compared to humans.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit temporal expressions within a text and apply this information throughout the whole article, assigning activity times to all clauses. $$$$$ We describe a procedure for arranging into a time-line the contents of news stories describing the development of some situation.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ This research can greatly improve the performance of time-stamper and might lead to a list of machine learning rules for time detection.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ As data we used a set of news stories about an earthquake in Afghanistan that occurred at the end of May in 1998.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ Duszak (1991) had readers reconstruct a news story from the randomized sentences.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ Evaluations show a performance of 52%, compared to humans.

 $$$$$ This research can greatly improve the performance of time-stamper and might lead to a list of machine learning rules for time detection.
 $$$$$ After stamping all the news stories from the analyzed set, we arrange the event-clauses from all the articles into a chronological order.
 $$$$$ According to his experiments readers have a default strategy by which—in the absence of cues to the contrary—they re-impose chronological order on events in the discourse.
 $$$$$ We describe a procedure for arranging into a time-line the contents of news stories describing the development of some situation.

 $$$$$ Several linguistic and psycholinguistic studies deal with the problem of time-arrangement of different texts.
 $$$$$ We describe a procedure for arranging into a time-line the contents of news stories describing the development of some situation.
 $$$$$ The parse tree also gives information about the tense of verbs, used later for time assignment.
 $$$$$ There are no such clauses in the analyzed data, so we ignore this complication for the present.
