These numbers compare favorably with the previous literature $$$$$ Such a text where all the events are organized in a chronological order might be very helpful in multidocument summarization, where it is important to include into the final summary not only the most important information but also the most recent one.
These numbers compare favorably with the previous literature $$$$$ In most cases this assumption works correctly (example 5.2–5.3): The last time interval assigned for sentence 5.2 is {1998:53:0}---{1998:71:0}, which gives an approximate range of days when the previous earthquake happened.
These numbers compare favorably with the previous literature $$$$$ To divide sentences into event-clauses we use CONTEX (Hermjakob, 1997), a parser that produces a syntactic parse tree augmented with semantic labels.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) also explore temporal linking with events, but do not assume that events and time stamps have been provided by an external process. $$$$$ Evaluations show a performance of 52%, compared to humans.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) also explore temporal linking with events, but do not assume that events and time stamps have been provided by an external process. $$$$$ After doing that we obtain a new set of event-clauses which can easily be divided into two subsets–the first one containing all the references to the February earthquake, the second one containing the list of event-clauses in chronological order, describing what happened in May.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ There are no such clauses in the analyzed data, so we ignore this complication for the present.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ In addition to a description of the May earthquake, these texts contain references to another earthquake that occurred in the same region in February 1998.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ Some of the texts were written on the same day.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ After stamping all the news stories from the analyzed set, we arrange the event-clauses from all the articles into a chronological order.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit temporal expressions within a text and apply this information throughout the whole article, assigning activity times to all clauses. $$$$$ We describe a procedure for arranging into a time-line the contents of news stories describing the development of some situation.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit temporal expressions within a text and apply this information throughout the whole article, assigning activity times to all clauses. $$$$$ As data we used a set of news stories about an earthquake in Afghanistan that occurred at the end of May in 1998.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit temporal expressions within a text and apply this information throughout the whole article, assigning activity times to all clauses. $$$$$ Several psycholinguistic experiments show the influence of event-arrangement in news stories on the ease of comprehension by readers.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ In order to facilitate subsequent processing, we wish to rephrase relative clauses as full independent sentences.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ After stamping all the news stories from the analyzed set, we arrange the event-clauses from all the articles into a chronological order.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ For example remote mountainous area rocked three months earlier by another massive quake 5.2.4 that <another massive quake> claimed some 2,300 victims.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ Such clauses are treated as one event and only one time-point will be assigned to them.

 $$$$$ These news stories were taken from CNN, ABC, and APW websites for the DUC-2000 meeting.
 $$$$$ Very often the parser gives information about the referential antecedents (in the example below, Russia).
 $$$$$ After stamping all the news stories from the analyzed set, we arrange the event-clauses from all the articles into a chronological order.
 $$$$$ The same paper states that “it is important to reconstruct the underlying event order2 for narrative analysis to assign meaning to the sequence in which the events are narrated at the level of discourse structure....If the underlying event structure cannot be reconstructed, it may well be impossible to understand the narrative at all, let alone assign meaning to its structure”.

 $$$$$ According to his experiments readers have a default strategy by which—in the absence of cues to the contrary—they re-impose chronological order on events in the discourse.
 $$$$$ In this paper we made an attempt to not just analyze and decode temporal expressions but to apply this analysis throughout the whole text and assign time-stamps to such type of clauses, which later could be used as separate sentences in various natural language applications, for example in multidocument summarization. text number of manually number of time point percentage of number created event-clauses correctly assigned to correct manually created clauses assignment target 1 7 6 85.71 target 2 27 20 74.07 target 3 5 4 80.00 target 4 28 26 92.85 target 5 33 30 90.91 target 6 58 37 63.79 Total 158 123 77.85
 $$$$$ Such a text where all the events are organized in a chronological order might be very helpful in multidocument summarization, where it is important to include into the final summary not only the most important information but also the most recent one.
 $$$$$ Bell (1997) notices “more research is needed on the effects of time structure on news comprehension.
