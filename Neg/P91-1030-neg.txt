(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) had shown the use of dependency in Prepositional Phrase disambiguation, and the experimental results reported in (Hock en maier, 2003) demonstrate that a language model which encodes a rich notion of predicate argument structure (e.g. including long-range relations arising through coordination) can significantly improve the parsing performances. $$$$$ Of course, most of the preposition association pairs from the AP sample end up being nonsignificant; of the 88,860 pairs, fewer than half (40,869) occur with a frequency greater than 1, and only 8337 have a t-score greater than 1.65.

Selectional preference has been shown to be useful for, e.g., resolving ambiguous attachments (Hindle and Rooth, 1991), word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ We need to explore ways to enter more complex calculations into the procedure.

But it is harder because it does not provide the predictor with all the information needed to solve many doubtful cases; (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) found that human arbiters consistently reach a higher agreement when they are given the entire sentence rather than just the four words concerned. $$$$$ We propose that ambiguous prepositional phrase attachment can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with noun and verb, estimated on the basis of word distribution in a large corpus.
But it is harder because it does not provide the predictor with all the information needed to solve many doubtful cases; (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) found that human arbiters consistently reach a higher agreement when they are given the entire sentence rather than just the four words concerned. $$$$$ It is clear however, that the simple model of attachment preference that we have proposed, based only on the verb, noun and preposition, is too weak to make correct attachments in many cases.
But it is harder because it does not provide the predictor with all the information needed to solve many doubtful cases; (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) found that human arbiters consistently reach a higher agreement when they are given the entire sentence rather than just the four words concerned. $$$$$ For each noun phrase head, we recorded the following preposition if any occurred (ignoring whether or not the parser attached the preposition to the noun phrase), and the preceding verb if the noun phrase was the object of that verb.

(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) first proposed solving the prepositional attachment task with the help of statistical information, and also defined the prevalent formulation as a binary decision problem with three words involved. $$$$$ The remaining cases are all hard in some way, and the performance tends to be worse on these cases, showing clearly for a more elaborated model.
(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) first proposed solving the prepositional attachment task with the help of statistical information, and also defined the prevalent formulation as a binary decision problem with three words involved. $$$$$ Part of the problem may be the fact that adverbial noun phrase headed by percent in (16) does not passivize or pronominalize, so that there are no sure verb attachment cases directly corresponding to these uses of scalar motion verbs.
(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) first proposed solving the prepositional attachment task with the help of statistical information, and also defined the prevalent formulation as a binary decision problem with three words involved. $$$$$ For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase in a verb -Iobject context as in sentence (1), these two principles — at least in the version of syntax that Frazier assumes — make opposite predictions: Right Association predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment.
