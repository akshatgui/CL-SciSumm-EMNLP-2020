(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) had shown the use of dependency in Prepositional Phrase disambiguation, and the experimental results reported in (Hock en maier, 2003) demonstrate that a language model which encodes a rich notion of predicate argument structure (e.g. including long-range relations arising through coordination) can significantly improve the parsing performances. $$$$$ Right Association, which predicts noun attachment, does better, since in our sample there are more noun attachments, but it still has an error rate of 33%.

Selectional preference has been shown to be useful for, e.g., resolving ambiguous attachments (Hindle and Rooth, 1991), word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains.

But it is harder because it does not provide the predictor with all the information needed to solve many doubtful cases; (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) found that human arbiters consistently reach a higher agreement when they are given the entire sentence rather than just the four words concerned. $$$$$ Of course, if attachment ambiguity demands reference to semantics and discourse models, there is little hope in the near term of building computational models for unrestricted text to resolve the ambiguity.

(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) first proposed solving the prepositional attachment task with the help of statistical information, and also defined the prevalent formulation as a binary decision problem with three words involved. $$$$$ For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase in a verb -Iobject context as in sentence (1), these two principles — at least in the version of syntax that Frazier assumes — make opposite predictions: Right Association predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment.
