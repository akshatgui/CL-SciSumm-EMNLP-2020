Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multi word compounds in bi texts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model. $$$$$ A simple translation model is just a joint probability distribution Pr(s, t), which indicates the probability that a randomly selected link in the bitext links
Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multi word compounds in bi texts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model. $$$$$ Assumption 1 may not be completely safe even with this restriction, due to the imprecise nature of translation model construction algorithms.
Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multi word compounds in bi texts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model. $$$$$ The NCCs proposed for the V objective function were much more likely to be validated than those proposed for I, because the predictive value function v' is much easier to estimate a priori than the predictive value function i'.
Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multi word compounds in bi texts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model. $$$$$ A translation model can be constructed automatically from texts that exist in two languages (bitexts) (Brown et al., 1993; Melamed, 1997).

 $$$$$ The discovery process can be greatly accelerated by testing only candidate NCCs for which Equation 4 is likely to be positive.
 $$$$$ Objective evaluation on a simple machine translation task has shown the method's potential to improve the quality of MT output.
 $$$$$ Sometimes, NCCs have multiple possible gap fillers, for example &quot;make up {my,your,his,their} mind.&quot; When the gap filling procedure finds two or three possible fillers, the most frequent filler is used, and the rest are ignored in the hope that they will be discovered on the next iteration.
 $$$$$ Furthermore, translational equivalence relations involving explicit representations of targetlanguage NCCs are more useful than fertility distributions for applications that do translation by table lookup.

 $$$$$ In the second phase, the algorithm estimates translation probabilities by dividing the link counts by the total number of links.
 $$$$$ There was no opportunity to measure the impact of NCC recognition under the objective function I on any real application, but Figure 3 shows that the mutual information of successive test translation models rose as desired.
 $$$$$ For example, &quot;tax system&quot; is most often translated into French as &quot;regime fiscale.&quot; Each new batch of validated NCCs raises the value of the objective function for the given application, as demonstrated in Section 8.

Instead, we develop a new scoring criterion, based on Melamed (1997). $$$$$ Instead, I use the weaker Assumption 5 Let tx and ty be the most frequent translations of x and y in each other's presence, in the base translation model.
Instead, we develop a new scoring criterion, based on Melamed (1997). $$$$$ Recognition of source-language NCCs would certainly improve the performance of their models, but Brown et al. warn that ... one must be discriminating in choosing multi-word cepts.
Instead, we develop a new scoring criterion, based on Melamed (1997). $$$$$ Therefore, NCCs that are tested at the same time must satisfy the mutual exclusion condition: No word s E S may participate in more than one candidate NCC at the same time.
Instead, we develop a new scoring criterion, based on Melamed (1997). $$$$$ The Incorrect Model is uncertain about how &quot;bilan&quot; should be translated.

Melamed (1997) and Lin (1999) have done some research on non compositional phrases discovery. $$$$$ The method is based on the insight that treatment of NCCs as multiple words reduces the predictive power of translation models.
Melamed (1997) and Lin (1999) have done some research on non compositional phrases discovery. $$$$$ However, at least for translationrelated applications, it is not a sufficient property.

Melamed (1997) and Lin (1999) have done some research on non compositional phrases discovery. $$$$$ To make discovery of NCCs involving function words more likely, I consider content words that are separated by one or two functions words to be adjacent.

Some of the most sophisticated work on this aspect of problem again seems to be that of Melamed (1997). $$$$$ This objective function may also be used for optimizing cross-language information retrieval, where translational distributions must be estimated either for queries or for documents before queries and documents can be compared (Oard & Dorr, 1996).
