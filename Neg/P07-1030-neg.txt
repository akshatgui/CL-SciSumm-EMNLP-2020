(Davidov et al, 2007) introduce the use of term frequency patterns for relationship discovery. $$$$$ Results on the three domains we considered indicate that, taken as an aggregate, the relations that are generated for a given domain paint a rather clear picture of the range of information pertinent to that domain.
(Davidov et al, 2007) introduce the use of term frequency patterns for relationship discovery. $$$$$ We evaluate the method on three different rich concepts and find that in each case the method generates a broad variety of relationships with good precision.

For example, Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008) linked instantiations of a set of semantic relations into existing semantic ontologies and Davidov et al (2007) employed seed concepts from a given semantic class to discover relations shared by concepts in that class. $$$$$ We present a web mining method for discovering and enhancing relationships in which a specified concept (word class) participates.

As a pre-requisite to extracting relations among pairs of classes, the method described in (Davidov et al., 2007) extracts class instances from unstructured Web documents, by submitting pairs of instances as queries and analyzing the contents of the top 1,000 documents returned by a Web search engine. $$$$$ Moreover, all this was done using standard search engine methods on the web.

The evaluation methodology is also quite different, as the instance sets acquired based on the input seed instances in (Davidov et al, 2007) are only evaluated for three hand-picked classes, with precision scores of 90% for names of countries, 87% for fish species and 68% for instances of constellations. $$$$$ Thus, for fish we discovered that one of the all-toall relationships captures a precise set of fish body parts, and another captures swimming verbs.

For example, (Etzioni et al, 2004) discovered a set of countries and (Davidov et al, 2007) discovered diverse country relationships, including location relationships between a country and its capital and a country and its rivers. $$$$$ We discover a whole range of relationships focused on the given concept, rather than generic known relationships as in most previous work.

Davidov et al (2007) developed a web mining approach for discovering relations in which a specified concept participates based on clustering patterns in which the concept words and other words appear. $$$$$ However, such relationships can often be very useful for ontology construction, since in many cases they introduce strong connections between two different concepts.
