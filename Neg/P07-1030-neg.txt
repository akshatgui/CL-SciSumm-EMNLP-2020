(Davidov et al, 2007) introduce the use of term frequency patterns for relationship discovery. $$$$$ As others have shown as well, two concept words can be sufficient to generate almost the entire class to which the words belong when the class is welldefined.

For example, Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008) linked instantiations of a set of semantic relations into existing semantic ontologies and Davidov et al (2007) employed seed concepts from a given semantic class to discover relations shared by concepts in that class. $$$$$ We evaluate the method on three different rich concepts and find that in each case the method generates a broad variety of relationships with good precision.

As a pre-requisite to extracting relations among pairs of classes, the method described in (Davidov et al., 2007) extracts class instances from unstructured Web documents, by submitting pairs of instances as queries and analyzing the contents of the top 1,000 documents returned by a Web search engine. $$$$$ There is certainly much room for tuning of these parameters.

The evaluation methodology is also quite different, as the instance sets acquired based on the input seed instances in (Davidov et al, 2007) are only evaluated for three hand-picked classes, with precision scores of 90% for names of countries, 87% for fish species and 68% for instances of constellations. $$$$$ These cision. studies, however, focused on the classification of We wish now to build on that result in the fol- pairs that were either given or extracted using some lowing way.

(Davidov et al, 2007) proposed a method for unsupervised discovery of concept specific relations, requiring initial word seeds. $$$$$ Such relations can certainly be of interest (see Section 7), but are not our focus in this paper.

Pattern driven search engine queries allow to access such information and gather the required data very efficiently (Davidov et al, 2007). $$$$$ Apparently, the requirement that half the constellations appear in a relation limited the number of viable relations since many constellations are quite obscure.

Pattern driven search engine queries allow to access such information and gather the required data very efficiently (Davidov et al, 2007). $$$$$ Results on the three domains we considered indicate that, taken as an aggregate, the relations that are generated for a given domain paint a rather clear picture of the range of information pertinent to that domain.

For example, (Etzioni et al, 2004) discovered a set of countries and (Davidov et al, 2007) discovered diverse country relationships, including location relationships between a country and its capital and a country and its rivers. $$$$$ The method depends on a number of numerical parameters that control the subtle tradeoff between quantity and quality of generated relations.

To use clusters for classification we define a HITS measure similar to that of (Davidov et al, 2007), reflecting the affinity of a given nominal pair to a given cluster. $$$$$ Moreover, all this was done using standard search engine methods on the web.

The precision observed for this task is comparable to precision obtained for Country-Capital and Country-Language in a previous single-language acquisition study (Davidov et al, 2007). $$$$$ Thus, for fish we discovered that one of the all-toall relationships captures a precise set of fish body parts, and another captures swimming verbs.

On-line usage of web queries is less frequent and was used mainly in semantic acquisition applications: the discovery of semantic verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), the acquisition of entailment relations (Szpektor et al, 2004), and the discovery of concept-specific relationships (Davidov et al, 2007). $$$$$ Another eleven meaningful relations were generated for which we did not compute precision numbers.
