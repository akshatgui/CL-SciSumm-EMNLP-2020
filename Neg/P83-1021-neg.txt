While chart parsing can famously be cast as deduction (Pereira and Warren, 1983), what chart parsing really is is an algebraic closure over the rules of a phrase structure grammar, which is most naturally expressed inside a constraint solver such as CHR (Morawietz, 2000). $$$$$ Earley Deduction generalizes Earley parsing in a direct and natural way.

Basically, it is similar to Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970), augmented with unification (Pereira and Warren, 1983) and probability (Paeseler, 1987), but with a delayed commitment approach to scoring (Aho and Peterson, 1972). $$$$$ There is a marked contrast with purely top-down proof procedures, such as Prolog, to which highly effective spare recovery techniques can be applied relatively easily.
