For reasons of time, I won't go into details of Earley Deduction (see Pereira and Warren (1983) for details}. $$$$$ In this case, the derived clause is a(C1, where a is a most general unifier of the two literals concerned, and C' is C' minus its selected literal.

Deductive logic (Pereira and Warren, 1983), extended with semi rings (Goodman, 1999), is an established formal ism used in parsing. $$$$$ Whether for interesting subclasses of, grammars or specific grammars of interest, it is still important to determine how efficient parsing can be.

While chart parsing can famously be cast as deduction (Pereira and Warren, 1983), what chart parsing really is is an algebraic closure over the rules of a phrase structure grammar, which is most naturally expressed inside a constraint solver such as CHR (Morawietz, 2000). $$$$$ The objects that appear as arguments in DCG rules are tree fragments every node of which has a number of children predetermined by the functor that labels the node.

Basically, it is similar to Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970), augmented with unification (Pereira and Warren, 1983) and probability (Paeseler, 1987), but with a delayed commitment approach to scoring (Aho and Peterson, 1972). $$$$$ Because definite clauses are only semidecidable, general proof procedures may not terminate for some sets of definite clauses.

The "parsing as deduction" framework (Pereira and Warren, 1983) is now over 20 years old. $$$$$ A more detailed discussion would take us beyond the intended scope of this paper.

But if we use existing techniques for parsing DCGs, then we are also confronted with an undecidability problem: the recognition problem for DCGs is undecidable (Pereira and Warren, 1983). $$$$$ Using different terminology, Bresnan and Kaplan (Bresnan and Kaplan, 1982) have shown that the parsing problem for LFG is decidable because LFGs are offline parsable.
But if we use existing techniques for parsing DCGs, then we are also confronted with an undecidability problem: the recognition problem for DCGs is undecidable (Pereira and Warren, 1983). $$$$$ The Earley Deduction proof procedure schema is named after Earley's context-free parsing algorithm (Earley, 1970), on which it is based.

In particular, we developed an architecture inspired by the Earley deduction work of Pereira and Warren (1983) but which generalized that work allowing for its use in both a parsing and generation mode merely by setting the values of a small number of parameters. $$$$$ Those larger classes of definite clauses can be seen as grammar formalisms in which the atomic grammar symbols of context-free grammars have been replaced by complex symbols that are matched by unification (Robinson, 1965; Colmerauer, 1978; Pereira and Warren, 1980).

It is exactly this mismatch between structure of the traversal and Pereira and Warren (1983) point out that Earley deduction is not restricted to a left-to-right expansion of goals, but this suggestion was not followed up with a specific a lgorithm addressing the problems discussed here. $$$$$ Among these are the question of recognizing derived clauses that are no longer useful in Earley-style parsing, the design of restricted formalisms with a polynomial bound on the number of distinct derived clauses, and independent, characterizations of the classes of offlinepa rsable grammars and languages.

The parsing-as-deduction approach proposed in Pereira and Warren (1983) and exlended in Shieber et al (1995) and the parsing schemaladetincd in Sikkel (1997) are well established parsing paradigms in computalional linguistics. $$$$$ We would like to make a few informal observations at this point to clarify the relationship between DCGs and other unification grammar formalisms â€” LFG in particular.

 $$$$$ Literals have the forth p(11,...4), where p is the predicate of arity k and the ti the arguments.
 $$$$$ Although we must leave to a separate paper the details of the application to LFG of the unification algorithms from theorem proving, we will note here that the formal properties of logical and LFG or UG unification are similar, and there are adaptations to LFG and UG of the algorithms and data structures used in the logical case.
