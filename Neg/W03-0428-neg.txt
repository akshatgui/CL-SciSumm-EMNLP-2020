Another approach we will also focus is dividing words into characters and applying character-level models (Klein et al, 2003). $$$$$ A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997, Wacholder et al., 1997, Bikel et al., 1997).
Another approach we will also focus is dividing words into characters and applying character-level models (Klein et al, 2003). $$$$$ Having such unknown-word models as an add-on is perhaps a misplaced focus: in these tasks, providing correct behavior on unknown words is typically the key challenge.
