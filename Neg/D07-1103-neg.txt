We filtered the obtained phrase table using the method described in (Johnson et al, 2007). $$$$$ An important part of the process of Statistical Ma chine Translation (SMT) involves inferring a large table of phrase pairs that are translations of each other from a large corpus of aligned sentences.These phrase pairs together with estimates of con ditional probabilities and useful feature weights, called collectively a phrasetable, are used to match a source sentence to produce candidate translations.

Significance filtering of the phrase tables (Johnson et al,2007) implemented for Moses by Chris Dyer. $$$$$ In this paper, we show that it is possible to prune phrasetables using a straightforward approach based on significance testing, that this approach does notadversely affect the quality of translation as mea sured by BLEU score, and that savings in terms ofnumber of discarded phrase pairs can be quite substantial.
Significance filtering of the phrase tables (Johnson et al,2007) implemented for Moses by Chris Dyer. $$$$$ Together these results suggest that, for these corpus sizes, the increase in the number of strongly supported phrase pairs is greater than the increase in the number of poorly supported pairs, which agrees with intuition.Although there may be other approaches to prun ing that achieve a similar effect, the use of Fisher?s exact test is mathematically and conceptually one of the simplest since it asks a question separately for each phrase pair: ?Considering this phase pair in isolation of any other analysis on the corpus, could it have occurred plausibly by purely random processes inherent in the corpus construction??

 $$$$$ In some cases, an im provement in BLEU is obtained at the same time although the effect is less pronounced if state-of-the-art phrasetable smoothing is employed.
 $$$$$ To test the effects of significance pruning on larger corpora, a series of experiments was run on a much larger corpus based on that distributed for MT06Chinese?English (NIST MT, 2006).

 $$$$$ The choice of the best translation is made based on the combination of the probabilities and feature weights, and much discussion has been made of how to make the estimates of probabilites, how to smooth these estimates, and what features are most useful for discriminating among the translations.However, a cursory glance at phrasetables pro duced often suggests that many of the translations are wrong or will never be used in any translation.
