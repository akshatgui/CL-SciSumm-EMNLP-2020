This figure shows the amount of time (excluding any startup overhead) spent parsing or bracketing using this system (the two lowest lines) versus the parsers of Collins (2003) and Charniak (2000) run with default settings. $$$$$ Section 7.1 gives a much more detailed analysis of the parsers’ performance.

Reranking of n-best lists has recently become popular in several natural language problems, including parsing (Collins, 2003), machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002) and web search (Joachims, 2002). $$$$$ First, say that the most specific estimate e1 = n1 f1 ; that is, f1 is the value of the denominator count in the relative frequency estimate.
Reranking of n-best lists has recently become popular in several natural language problems, including parsing (Collins, 2003), machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002) and web search (Joachims, 2002). $$$$$ As a result, the model will assign unreasonably high probabilities to NPs such as [NP yesterday the dog] in sentences such as Yesterday the dog barked. nonterminal is an NPB.
Reranking of n-best lists has recently become popular in several natural language problems, including parsing (Collins, 2003), machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002) and web search (Joachims, 2002). $$$$$ For these reasons we modify the nonterminal for sentences without subjects to be SG (see figure 11).

Collins (2003) uses both Markov Random Fields and boosting, Och and Ney (2002) use a maximum entropy ranking scheme, and Joachims (2002) uses a support vector approach. $$$$$ I would like to thank the members of my thesis committee—Aravind Joshi, Mark Liberman, Fernando Pereira, and Mark Steedman—for the remarkable breadth and depth of their feedback.

All the COL03 systems are results obtained using the restriction of the output of Collins (2003) parser. $$$$$ Specifically, equations (5) and (6) are modified to be The modifier and previous-modifier nonterminals are always adjacent, so the distance variable is constant and is omitted.

My guess is that the features used in e.g., the Collins (2003) or Charniak (2000) parsers are probably close to optimal for English Penn Treebank parsing (Marcus et al, 1993), but that other features might improve parsing of other languages or even other English genres. $$$$$ See Resnik (1992), Schabes (1992), and Schabes and Waters (1993) for work on stochastic tree-adjoining grammars.

The corpora are first parsed using Collins's parser (Collins, 2003) with the boundaries of all the entity mentions kept. $$$$$ The results in Table 7 show that the subcategorization, adjacency, and “verb-crossing” features all contribute significantly to model 2’s (and by implication model 3’s) performance.
