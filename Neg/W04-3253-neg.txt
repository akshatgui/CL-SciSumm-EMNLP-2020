For instance, instead of representing the polarity of a term using a binary value, Mullen and Collier (2004) use Turney's (2002) method to assign a real value to represent term polarity and introduce a variety of numerical features that are aggregate measures of the polarity values of terms selected from the document under consideration. $$$$$ We describe the methods used to assign values to selected words and phrases, and we introduce a method of bringing them together to create a model for the classification of texts.

Mullen and Collier (2004) used SVMs and expanded the feature set for representing documents with favor ability measures from a variety of diverse sources. $$$$$ PMI is defined by Church and Hanks (1989) as follows: where is the probability that and co-occur.
Mullen and Collier (2004) used SVMs and expanded the feature set for representing documents with favor ability measures from a variety of diverse sources. $$$$$ SVMs were built using Kudo’s TinySVM software implementation.4 Several kernel types, kernel parameters, and optimization parameters were investigated, but no appreciable and consistent benefits were gained by deviating from the the default linear kernel with all parameter values set to their default, so only these results are reported here, with the exception of the Turney Values-only model on the Pitchfork dataset.
Mullen and Collier (2004) used SVMs and expanded the feature set for representing documents with favor ability measures from a variety of diverse sources. $$$$$ Experiments on movie review data from Epinions.com demonstrate that hybrid SVMs which combine unigram-style feature-based SVMs with those based on real-valued favorability measures obtain superior performance, producing the best results yet published using this data.

 $$$$$ On this dataset the feature sets investigated include various combinations of the Turney value, the three text-wide Osgood values, and word token unigrams or lemmatized unigrams.
 $$$$$ Models using the features introduced are further combined with unigram models which have been shown to be effective in the past (Pang et al., 2002) and lemmatized versions of the unigram models.
 $$$$$ It also seems likely that the topic-relations aspect of the present research only scratches the surface of what should be possible.
 $$$$$ The contribution of these new feature types is most pronounced when they are used to train a separate SVM and the two SVMs are combined in a hybrid SVM.

Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004) integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors and some syntactic relations into the features of SVM. $$$$$ This paper introduces an approach to classifying texts as positive or negative using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a well-known and powerful tool for classification of vectors of real-valued features (Vapnik, 1998).
Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004) integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors and some syntactic relations into the features of SVM. $$$$$ The results of a variety of experiments are presented, using both data which is not topic annotated and data which has been hand annotated for topic.
Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004) integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors and some syntactic relations into the features of SVM. $$$$$ Not even almost.” Clearly, the strongly positive sentiment conveyed by these four sentences is much different from what we would expect from the sum of its parts.
Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004) integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors and some syntactic relations into the features of SVM. $$$$$ In training data, reviews corresponding to a below average rating were classed as negative and those with an above average rating were classed as positive.

 $$$$$ Negative reviews may contain many apparently positive phrases even while maintaining a strongly negative tone, and the opposite is also common.
 $$$$$ Combinations of SVMs using these features in conjunction with SVMs based on unigrams and lemmatized unigrams are shown to outperform models which do not use these information sources.
 $$$$$ For a tutorial on SVMs and details of their formulation we refer the reader to Burges (1998) and Cristiani and Shawe-Tailor (2000).

Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). $$$$$ Our approach shares the intuition of Natsukawa and Yi (2003) that sentiment expressed with regard to a particular subject can best be identified with reference to the subject itself.
Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). $$$$$ Many—perhaps most—terms’ favorability content depends to some extent on their context.
Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). $$$$$ The key is to find a way to incorporate pertinent semantic orientation values derived from phrases into a model of texts.
Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). $$$$$ The main development presented here is the incorporation of several new information sources as features into SVMs which previously relied entirely on the effective but limited “bag of words” approach.

Mullen and Collier (2004) manually annotated named entities in their dataset (i.e. title of the record and name of the artist for music record reviews), and utilized presence and position features in their ML approach. $$$$$ Although such approaches have been employed effectively (Pang et al., 2002), there appears to remain considerable room for improvement.

Mullen and Collier (2004) manually annotated named entities in their dataset (i.e. title of the record and name of the artist for music record reviews), and utilized presence and position features in their ML approach. $$$$$ Text length normalization appeared to harm performance on this dataset, and so the models reported here for this dataset were not normalized for length.
Mullen and Collier (2004) manually annotated named entities in their dataset (i.e. title of the record and name of the artist for music record reviews), and utilized presence and position features in their ML approach. $$$$$ This paper introduces an approach to sentiment analysis which uses support vector machines (SVMs) to bring together diverse sources of potentially pertinent information, including several favorability measures for phrases and adjectives and, where available, knowledge of the topic of the text.

Mullen and Collier (2004), for example, uses WordNet to add information about words found within text, and consequently reports improved classification performance in a sentiment analysis task. $$$$$ The method introduced in this paper allows several methods of assigning semantic values to phrases and words within a text to be exploited in a more useful way than was previously possible, by incorporating them as features for SVM modeling, and for explicit topic information to be utilized, when available, by features incorporating such values.
Mullen and Collier (2004), for example, uses WordNet to add information about words found within text, and consequently reports improved classification performance in a sentiment analysis task. $$$$$ Further experiments using a feature set enriched with topic information on a smaller dataset of music reviews handannotated for topic are also reported, the results of which suggest that incorporating topic information into such models may also yield improvement.
