In order to expand the dictionaries using a set of monolingual comparable corpora, the basic approach pioneered by Fung and McKeown (1997) and Rapp (1995, 1999) is to be further developed and refined in the second phase of the project as to obtain a practical tool that can be used in an industrial context. $$$$$ In a number of recent studies it has been shown that word translations can be automatically derived from the statistical distribution of words in bilingual parallel texts (e. g. Catizone, Russell & Warwick, 1989; Brown et al., 1990; Dagan, Church & Gale, 1993; Kay & ROscheisen, 1993).
