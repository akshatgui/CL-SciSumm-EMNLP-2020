Our first attempt is to directly apply the state of-art SRL system (Meza-Ruiz and Riedel, 2009) that trained on the CoNLL 08 shared task dataset (Surdeanu et al, 2008), hereafter called SRL-BS, to news tweets. $$$$$ Although some of the systems that implemented joint approaches obtained good results, the top five systems in the closed challenge are essentially systems with pipeline architectures.

Domain-oriented semantic structures are valuable assets because their representation suits information needs in the domain; however, the extraction of such structures is difficult due to the large gap between the text and these structures. On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically oriented semantics from text has long been studied in computational linguistics, and has recently been formalized as Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and semantic structure extraction (Baker et al, 2007) (Surdeanu et al, 2008). $$$$$ Similar to last year’s shared task (Nivre et al., 2007), the vast majority of parsing models fall in two classes: transition-based (“trans” in the table) or graph-based (“graph”) models.
