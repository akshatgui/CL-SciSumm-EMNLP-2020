Empirical work on NLP domain shifts has focused on the former. For example, Blitzer et al (2007) learned correspondences between features across domains and Jiang and Zhai (2007) weighted source domain examples by their similarity to the target distribution. We continue in this tradition by making two assumptions about our setting. $$$$$ For reasons of space, for each target domain we show adaptation from only the two domains on which SCL-MI performed the worst relative to the supervised baseline.
