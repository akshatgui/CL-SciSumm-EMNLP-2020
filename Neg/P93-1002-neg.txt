 $$$$$ In addition, because we key off of rare words in considering ending points, deletion identification requires time linear in the length of the deletion.
 $$$$$ Because length-based alignment algorithms ignore lexical information, their errors can be of a more spectacular nature.
 $$$$$ Using this algorithm, we have aligned three large English/French corpora.
 $$$$$ We find the alignment that maximizes the probability of generating the corpus with this translation model.

As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ In modeling the frequency of word beads, notice that there are five distinct distributions we need to model: the distribution of 1:0 word beads in 1:0 sentence beads, the distribution of 0:1 word beads in 0:1 sentence beads, and the distribution of all word beads in 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 sentence beads.
As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ Gale reports an approximate error rate of 2% on a different body of Hansard data with no discarding, and an error rate of 0.4% if 20% of the sentences can be discarded.

Other translation-based alignments (Kay, 199l; Chen, 1993) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and are very complex. $$$$$ However, substantially greater computing power is required before these approaches can become practical, and there is not much room for further improvements in accuracy.
Other translation-based alignments (Kay, 199l; Chen, 1993) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and are very complex. $$$$$ It requires a minimum of human intervention; for each language pair 100 sentences need to be aligned by hand to bootstrap the translation model.

Each type of the web page sentence aligner makes use of three conventional sentence alignment models, one is the length based model following (Brown 1991), one is the lexicon based model following (Chen 1993), and the other one is the hybrid model presented in (Zhao 2002). $$$$$ Because of thresholding, the search is linear in the length of the corpus so that a corpus need not be subdivided into smaller chunks.

 $$$$$ Taking the error rate of the Brown alignment to be 0.6%, we estimated the overall error rate of our alignment to be 0.4%.
 $$$$$ For example, the sentence John de Fido should have a higher probability of aligning with the sentence Jean a mange Fido than with the sentence Fido a mange Jean.
