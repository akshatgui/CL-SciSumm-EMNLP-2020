 $$$$$ In this paper, we describe a fast algorithm for aligning sentences with their translations in a bilingual corpus.
 $$$$$ The algorithm is language independent.
 $$$$$ Gale does not discuss this issue.

As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ The algorithm is language independent.

Other translation-based alignments (Kay, 199l; Chen, 1993) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and are very complex. $$$$$ The natural next step in sentence alignment is to account for word ordering in the translation model, e.g., the models described in (Brown et al., 1993) could be used.

As Chen (1993) points out, dynamic programming is particularly susceptible to deletions occurring in one of the two languages. $$$$$ The computation required is drastically reduced if the bilingual corpus can be subdivided into smaller chunks.

Simard and Plamondon (Simard and Plamondon, 1998) used a composite method in which the first pass does alignment at the level of characters asin (Church, 1993) (itself based on cognate matching) and the second pass uses IBM Model-1, following Chen (Chen, 1993). $$$$$ Our algorithm constructs a simple statistical word-to-word translation model on the fly during alignment.

By adopting the IBM model 1, (Chen 1993) used word translation probabilities, which he showed gives better accuracy than the sentence length based method. $$$$$ Even with numerous approximations, this algorithm is tens of times slower than the Brown and Gale algorithms.

(Simard and Plamondon 1996) used a two-pass approach, where the first pass performs length-based alignment at the character level as in (Gale and Church 1993) and the second pass uses IBM Model 1, following (Chen 1993). $$$$$ Dynamic programming is used to align anchors, and then dynamic programming is used again to align the text between anchors.

Each type of the web page sentence aligner makes use of three conventional sentence alignment models, one is the length based model following (Brown 1991), one is the lexicon based model following (Chen 1993), and the other one is the hybrid model presented in (Zhao 2002). $$$$$ To perform the search for the best alignment, dynamic programming (Bellman, 1957) is used.

EMACC finds only 1:1 textual units alignments in its present form but a document pair can be easily extended to a document bead following the example from (Chen, 1993). $$$$$ We have aligned a corpus of 3,000,000 sentences (of both English and French) of the Canadian Hansards, a corpus of 1,000,000 sentences of newer Hansard proceedings, and a corpus of 2,000,000 sentences of proceedings from the European Economic Community.

Asshown in (Chen, 1993) the accuracy of sentence length based methods decreases drastically when aligning texts containing small deletions or free translations. $$$$$ We view a bilingual corpus as a sequence of sentence beads (Brown et al., 1991b), where a sentence bead corresponds to an irreducible group of sentences that align with each other.
