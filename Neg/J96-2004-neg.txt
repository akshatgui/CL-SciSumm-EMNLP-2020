As advocated by Carletta (1996), we have used the Kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as a measure of coder agreement. $$$$$ For instance, he claims that finding associations between two variables that both rely on coding schemes with K < .7 is often impossible, and says that content analysis researchers generally think of K > .8 as good reliability, with .67 < K < .8 allowing tentative conclusions to be drawn.
As advocated by Carletta (1996), we have used the Kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as a measure of coder agreement. $$$$$ For instance, much current research on discourse phenomena distinguishes between behaviors which tend to occur at or around discourse segment boundaries and those which do not (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Kowtko, Isard, and Doherty 1992; Litman and Hirschberg 1990; Cahn 1992).

Following the works of Carletta (1996) and Artstein and Poesio (2008), there is an increasing consensus within the field that in order to properly gauge the reliability of an annotation effort, chance-corrected measures of inter-annotator agreement should be used. $$$$$ Currently, computational linguists and cognitive scientists working in the area of discourse and dialogue argue that their subjective judgments are reliable using several different statistics, none of which are easily interpretable or comparable to each other.

The reliability of the annotation was evaluated using the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ Here we use Siegel and Castellan's K because they explain their statistic more clearly, but the value of a is so closely related, especially under the usual expectations for reliability studies, that Krippendorff's statements about a hold, and we conflate the two under the more general name &quot;kappa.&quot; The advantages and disadvantages of different forms and extensions of kappa have been discussed in many fields but especially in medicine; see, for example, Berry (1992); Goldman (1992); Kraemer (1980); Soeken and Prescott (1986). dividing newspaper articles based on subject matter).

We measured inter-annotator agreement with the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) using the 1,391 items that two annotators scored in common. $$$$$ Meanwhile, researchers in content analysis have already experienced the same difficulties and come up with a solution in the kappa statistic.

To measure inter-annotator agreement, we compute Cohen's Kappa (Carletta, 1996) from the two sets of annotations. $$$$$ If, instead, the two coders were to use four categories in equal proportions, we would expect them to agree 25% of the time (since no matter what the first coder chooses, there is a 25% chance that the second coder will agree.)

To measure inter-annotator agreement, we compute Cohen's Kappa (Carletta, 1996) from the two sets of annotations. $$$$$ In assessing the amount of agreement among coders of category distinctions, the kappa statistic normalizes for the amount of expected chance agreement and allows a single measure to be calculated over multiple coders.
To measure inter-annotator agreement, we compute Cohen's Kappa (Carletta, 1996) from the two sets of annotations. $$$$$ For instance, one can imagine determining whether coders using a simplified coding scheme match what can be obtained by some better but more expensive method, which might itself be either objective or subjective.

Obtained percent agreement of 0.988 and coefficient (Carletta, 1996) of 0.975 suggest high convergence of both annotations. $$$$$ Now, researchers are beginning to require evidence that people besides the authors themselves can understand, and reliably make, the judgments underlying the research.

P (A) is the observed agreement between annotators and P (E) is the probability of agreement due to chance (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ Secondly, coding discourse and dialogue phenomena, and especially coding segment boundaries, may be inherently more difficult than many previous types of content analysis (for instance, 1 There are several variants of the kappa coefficient in the literature, including one, Scott's pi, which actually has been used at least once in our field, to assess agreement on move boundaries in monologues using action assembly theory (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
P (A) is the observed agreement between annotators and P (E) is the probability of agreement due to chance (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ And if both coders were to use one of two categories, but use one of the categories 95% of the time, we would expect them to agree 90.5% of the time (.952 + .052, or, in words, 95% of the time the first coder chooses the first category, with a .95 chance of the second coder also choosing that category, and 5% of the time the first coder chooses the second category, with a .05 chance of the second coder also doing so).

Inter-annotator agreement was sufficient (κ = 0.77 on average (Carletta, 1996)). $$$$$ The concerns of these researchers are largely the same as those in the field of content analysis (see especially Krippendorff [1980] and Weber [1985]), which has been through the same problems as we are currently facing and in which strong arguments have been made for using the kappa coefficient of agreement (Siegel and Castellan 1988) as a measure of reliability!
