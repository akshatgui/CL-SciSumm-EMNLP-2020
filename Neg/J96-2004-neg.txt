The reliability of the annotation was evaluated using the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ Whether we have reached (or will be able to reach) a reasonable level of agreement in our work as a field remains to be seen; our point here is merely that if, as a community, we adopt clearer statistics, we will be able to compare results in a standard way across different coding schemes and experiments and to evaluate current developments—and that will illuminate both our individual results and the way forward.

Annotation was highly reliable with a kappa (Carletta, 1996) of 3. $$$$$ On the other hand, Passonneau and Litman note that their figures are not properly interpretable and attempt to overcome this failing to some extent by showing that the agreement which they have obtained at least significantly differs from random agreement.

With the help of the kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) proposes to represent the dialog success independently from the task intrinsic complexity, thus opening the way to task generic comparative evaluation. $$$$$ If, instead, the two coders were to use four categories in equal proportions, we would expect them to agree 25% of the time (since no matter what the first coder chooses, there is a 25% chance that the second coder will agree.)
