In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al (1989). $$$$$ Since projections are monadic functions, we can remove the uninformative parentheses and write (a4:M* ARGO = 0(4)M* SUBJ), or, using the metavariable, (a I ARGO =a( Kw).
In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al (1989). $$$$$ Constituent structures are described by standard context-free rule notation (augmented with a variety of abbreviatory devices that do not change its generative power), while f-structures are described by Boolean combinations of function-argument equalities stated over variables that denote the structures of interest.

We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ In this paper we sketch an approach to machine translation that offers several advantages compared to many of the other strategies currently being pursued.
We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ In this paper, we extend this system one step further: we introduce correspondences between structures for sentences in different languages that stand in a translation relation to one another.
We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ We see it as one of the main advantages of our approach that it allows us to express correspondences between separate pieces of linguistically motivated representations and in this way allows the translator to exploit the linguistic descriptions of source and target language in a more direct way than is usually proposed.

The first one applies semantic transfer model via the methodology similar to the lexical functional grammar (Kaplan et al., 1989) and it is develop with the intention of public use. $$$$$ Constituent structures are described by standard context-free rule notation (augmented with a variety of abbreviatory devices that do not change its generative power), while f-structures are described by Boolean combinations of function-argument equalities stated over variables that denote the structures of interest.

The first one applies semantic transfer model via the methodology similar to the lexical functional grammar (Kaplan et al., 1989) and it is develop with the intention of public use. $$$$$ Thus, even though the units of the semantic structure correspond directly only to the units of the f-structure and have no immediate connection to the nodes of the c-structure, a semantic description can be formulated in terms of c-structure relations.


Kaplan et al (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). $$$$$ The approach is illustrated with examples from English, German and French where the source and the target language sentence show noteworthy differences in linguistic analysis.
Kaplan et al (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). $$$$$ Our general correspondence architecture thus applies naturally to the problem of translation.

Kaplan et al (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). $$$$$ This approach relies mainly on codescription, and thus it is different from other LFG-based approaches that use g description-by-analysis mechanism to relate the f-structure of a source language to the f-structure of a target language (see for example Kudo and Nomura, 1986).

Kaplan et al (1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. $$$$$ The approach is illustrated with examples from English, German and French where the source and the target language sentence show noteworthy differences in linguistic analysis.

Kaplan et al (1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. $$$$$ We also achieve modularity of a more basic sort: our correspondence mechanism permits contrastive transfer rules that depend on but do not duplicate the specifications of independently motivated grammars of the source and target languages (Isabelle and Macklovitch, 1986; Netter and Wedekind, 1986).
Kaplan et al (1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. $$$$$ One consequence of this approach is that the structure in the range of the correspondence, the one whose description is being developed, can only have properties that are derived from information explicitly identified in the domain structure.

Kaplan et al (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. $$$$$ We sketch and illustrate an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between separate levels of linguistic representation, as in the of codescriptions.

Kaplan et al (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. $$$$$ This approach permits the mapping between source and target to depend on information from various levels of linguistic abstraction while still preserving the modularity of linguistic components and of source and target grammars and lexicons.

Kaplan et al (1989) discussed such differences in embedding and offered two alternative analyses that rely only on codescriptive specifications. $$$$$ The only thing that we want to express is the constraint that the event in the embedded clause follows the event in the main clause.
