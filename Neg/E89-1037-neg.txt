In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al (1989). $$$$$ Our proposal allows for partial specifications and multi-level transfer.
In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al (1989). $$$$$ This approach permits the mapping between source and target to depend on information from various levels of linguistic abstraction while still preserving the modularity of linguistic components and of source and target grammars and lexicons.
In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al (1989). $$$$$ Yet that diverse information is still accessible to determine the set of target strings that adequately translate a source string.

We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ The approach is illustrated with examples from English, German and French where the source and the target language sentence show noteworthy differences in linguistic analysis.
We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ Thus, still following Kaplan (1987), if * appears in a schema to stand for the node matching a given rule-category, the functional description will include an equation containing that node (or an expression such as n2 that designates it) instead of *.
We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ This necessary relation is accomplished by lexically and structurally based transfer rules that do not make reference to each other.
We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ Since projections are monadic functions, we can remove the uninformative parentheses and write (a4:M* ARGO = 0(4)M* SUBJ), or, using the metavariable, (a I ARGO =a( Kw).

The first one applies semantic transfer model via the methodology similar to the lexical functional grammar (Kaplan et al., 1989) and it is develop with the intention of public use. $$$$$ The a correspondence maps from the f-structure of each language to its own corresponding semantic structure, and a second transfer correspondence 1' relates those structures.
The first one applies semantic transfer model via the methodology similar to the lexical functional grammar (Kaplan et al., 1989) and it is develop with the intention of public use. $$$$$ We sketch and illustrate an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between separate levels of linguistic representation, as in the of codescriptions.

 $$$$$ We can achieve modularity of linguistic specifications, by not requiring conceptually different kinds of linguistic information to be combined into a single structure.
 $$$$$ Suppose the c-structure and f-structure are related by 4) as in (2a) and that the function a then maps the f-structure units into corresponding units of semantic structure of the sort suggested by Fenstad et al. (1987).
 $$$$$ We define the relationship between the linguistic structures of the source and target languages in terms of a set of correspondence functions instead of providing derivational or procedural techniques for converting source into target.

Kaplan et al (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). $$$$$ Lexical transfer rules such as the one given in (8) independently establish the correspondence between source and target within-clause functions.

Kaplan et al (1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982). $$$$$ Earlier researchers have applied these mechanisms to the linguistic structures for sentences in a single language.

Kaplan et al (1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. $$$$$ Allowing these different projections to simultaneously determine the surface structure seems at first blush to complicate the computational problem of generation, but a moment of reflection will show that that is not necessarily so.

Kaplan et al (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. $$$$$ The functional description is determined from the trees that the c-structure grammar provides for the string by a simple matching process.
Kaplan et al (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. $$$$$ This is diagrammed in Figure 3.

Kaplan et al (1989) discussed such differences in embedding and offered two alternative analyses that rely only on codescriptive specifications. $$$$$ We sketch and illustrate an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between separate levels of linguistic representation, as in the of codescriptions.
Kaplan et al (1989) discussed such differences in embedding and offered two alternative analyses that rely only on codescriptive specifications. $$$$$ Our conceptual framework depends on notions of structure, structural description, and structural correspondence.
Kaplan et al (1989) discussed such differences in embedding and offered two alternative analyses that rely only on codescriptive specifications. $$$$$ In that sense it also differs from strategies pursued for example in the Eurotra project (Arnold and des Tombe, 1987), where transfer is based on one level of representation obtained by transforming the surface structure in successive steps.
