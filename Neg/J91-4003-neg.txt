 $$$$$ In this paper I have outlined a framework for lexical semantic research that I believe can be useful for both computational linguists and theoretical linguists alike.

The work of Pustejovsky [Pustejovsky, 1991] is related in its attempt o reduce the size and complexity of individual lexical entries. $$$$$ I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry.

Our view of relations in a concept network being the interpretations of metonymies is strongly reminiscent of older work in metonymy resolution such as Hobbs et al1993), Fass (1991), Markert and Hahn (2002) or the use of a generative lexicon and its relations in Pustejovsky (1991), which also are unsupervised. $$$$$ I argued against the view that word meanings are fixed and inflexible, where lexical ambiguity must be treated by multiple word entries in the lexicon.

To provide semantics for nouns, we use CoreLex (Buitelaar, 1998), in turn based on the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991). $$$$$ We return to this topic below, There are several interesting things about such collocations.
To provide semantics for nouns, we use CoreLex (Buitelaar, 1998), in turn based on the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991). $$$$$ The representation of lexical semantics, therefore, should be seen as just one of many levels in a richer characterization of contextual structure.

CoreLex is based on a different theory than Levin's (that of the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991)), but does provide a compatible decompositional meaning representation for nouns. $$$$$ The predicate eat is not within the space of related concepts generated from the semantics of the NP the prisoner; escape, however, did fall within the projective conclusion space for the Telic role of prisoner, as shown in Example 63.
CoreLex is based on a different theory than Levin's (that of the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991)), but does provide a compatible decompositional meaning representation for nouns. $$$$$ In addition to this static representation, I will introduce another mechanism for structuring lexical knowledge, the projective inheritance, which operates generatively from the qualia structure of a lexical item to create a relational structure for ad hoc categories.

The idea that noun meaning involves event-based description has been particularly emphasized by J. Pustejovsky (1991). $$$$$ I believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can be informed by computational tools for lexicology as well as an appreciation of the computational complexity of large lexical databases.

This semantic framework demonstrates that the association between nominal constituents and underlying predicative relation in root compounds is not arbitrary: it involves conceptual mechanisms that are triggered in other linguistic phenomena such as type coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991), anaphora (Fradin, 1984) or adjectival constructions (Bouillon and Viegas, 1993). $$$$$ Barselou 1983).

Such compounds illustrate the notion of co-compositionality (Pustejovsky 1991). $$$$$ The &quot;creation&quot; sense arises from the semantic role of cake that specifies it is an artifact (see below for discussion).
Such compounds illustrate the notion of co-compositionality (Pustejovsky 1991). $$$$$ This view suggests that, in such cases, the verb itself is not polysemous.

Pustejovsky (1991) refers to this kind of relation as co specification i.e. like verb can select for its argument type, an argument also can select its associated predicates. $$$$$ When integrated together, these inferences must be globally coherent, a state that is accomplished by processes of cooperation among separate semantic modules.

The associated predicate information is included in the qualia structure of a lexical item (Pustejovsky, 1991). $$$$$ Given what I have said, let us examine the questions presented above in more detail.
