Some work has touched on shared knowledge of lexical semantics [aacobs, 1985, Steinacker and Buchberger, 19831 and on grammatical framework suitable for bidirectional systems [Kay, 1984]. $$$$$ A description is an expression over an essentially arbitrary basic vocabulary.
Some work has touched on shared knowledge of lexical semantics [aacobs, 1985, Steinacker and Buchberger, 19831 and on grammatical framework suitable for bidirectional systems [Kay, 1984]. $$$$$ This possibility would be excluded if there were a path in one of the two descriptions that lead to an atomic value while the same path in the other one lead to some other value.
Some work has touched on shared knowledge of lexical semantics [aacobs, 1985, Steinacker and Buchberger, 19831 and on grammatical framework suitable for bidirectional systems [Kay, 1984]. $$$$$ If the English grammar states that pronominal objects follow the verb and the French one says that they precede, the same transfer grammar, though still without any explicit mention of order, will cause the appropriate &quot;reordering&quot; to take place.

As mentioned, FCG organises the information about an utterance in feature structures, similar to other feature-structure based formalisms (as first introduced by Kay (Kay, 1984)) but with some important differences. $$$$$ Given a pair of descriptions, the unification process first determines whether they are compatible in the sense of allowing the possibility of there being some object that is in the extension of both of them.

The family of grammar models that are based on such formalisms include Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) [Gazdar et al 1985], Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Bresnan 1982], Functional Unification Grammar (bUG) [Kay 1984], Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG) [Pollard and Sag 1988], and Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) [Karttunen 1986, Uszkoreit 1986, Zeevat et al 1987]. $$$$$ An example would be the following: Cat = V Lex = barks Tense = Pres Pers = 3 Subj = {Num = Sing Anim = + Obj = NONE = [P2 = [Fred = bark]]] IV Conclusion It has not been possible in this paper to give more than an impression of how an experimental machine translation system might be constructed based on FUG.

The text planner is implemented as a Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1984) in FUF (Elhadad 1993). $$$$$ To be sure, it allows more elaborate transfer grammars than the one just illustrated so that the translation of a sentence would not have to be structurally isomorphic with its source, modulo ordering.
