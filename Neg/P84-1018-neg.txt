Some work has touched on shared knowledge of lexical semantics [aacobs, 1985, Steinacker and Buchberger, 19831 and on grammatical framework suitable for bidirectional systems [Kay, 1984]. $$$$$ Implementing FUG in an efficient way requires skill and a variety of little known techniques.

As mentioned, FCG organises the information about an utterance in feature structures, similar to other feature-structure based formalisms (as first introduced by Kay (Kay, 1984)) but with some important differences. $$$$$ The first would usually be called its subject but is here characterized as the subject of its verb.
As mentioned, FCG organises the information about an utterance in feature structures, similar to other feature-structure based formalisms (as first introduced by Kay (Kay, 1984)) but with some important differences. $$$$$ These systems are all procedurally monotonic in the sense that, while new information may be added to existing data structures, possibly different information on different branches of a nondeterministic process, nothing is ever deleted or changed.
As mentioned, FCG organises the information about an utterance in feature structures, similar to other feature-structure based formalisms (as first introduced by Kay (Kay, 1984)) but with some important differences. $$$$$ Similarly, nothing more would be required in the transfer grammar in order to place adjectives properly with respect to the nouns they modify, and so forth.
As mentioned, FCG organises the information about an utterance in feature structures, similar to other feature-structure based formalisms (as first introduced by Kay (Kay, 1984)) but with some important differences. $$$$$ It means only that the notation and its interpretation are always uniform.

The family of grammar models that are based on such formalisms include Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) [Gazdar et al 1985], Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Bresnan 1982], Functional Unification Grammar (bUG) [Kay 1984], Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG) [Pollard and Sag 1988], and Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) [Karttunen 1986, Uszkoreit 1986, Zeevat et al 1987]. $$$$$ But the device is essentially syntactic.

The text planner is implemented as a Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1984) in FUF (Elhadad 1993). $$$$$ By way of illustration, consider the grammar in (3).
The text planner is implemented as a Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1984) in FUF (Elhadad 1993). $$$$$ The attribute a2 is an attribute in vi whose value if an FD, and so on.
The text planner is implemented as a Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1984) in FUF (Elhadad 1993). $$$$$ However, the programs, though subtle, are not large and, once written, they provide the grammarian and lexicographer with an emmense wealth of expressive devices.
