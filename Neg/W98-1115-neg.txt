Using this information, the model described in (Charniak et al 1998) is P (s $$$$$ Of the five terms in Equation 4, two can be directly estimated from training data: the &quot;boundary statistics&quot; p(N.:,k I tj) (the probability of a constituent of type NIAstarting just after the tag tj) and p(tk I NIA) (the probability of tk appearing just after the end of a constituent of type N.4).
Using this information, the model described in (Charniak et al 1998) is P (s $$$$$ In fact, the assumption that all productions are at most binary is not extraordinary, since tabular parsers that construct complete parse forests in worst-case 0(n3) time explicitly or implicitly convert their grammars into binary branching form (Lang, 1974; Lang, 1991).

Charniak et al (1998) and Caraballo and Charniak (1998) showed that, when seeking the best parse (using min= or max=), best-first parsing can be extremely effective. $$$$$ Once this has been done there is no need for incomplete edges at all in bottomup parsing, and parsing can be performed using the CKY algorithm, suitably extended to handle unary productions.

Charniak et al (1998) introduce overparsing as a technique to improve parse accuracy by continuing parsing after the first complete parse tree is found. $$$$$ For any single tag t3, the difference is not much, but as we use Equation 4 to compute our FOM for larger constituents, the numerator becomes smaller and smaller with respect to the denominator, effectively favoring smaller constituents.

This binarization process is similar to the one described in (Charniak et al, 1998). $$$$$ Note that regardless of 7/ the accuracy of the parse increases given extra time, but that all of the increase is achieved with only 1.5 to 2 times as many edges as needed for the first parse.
This binarization process is similar to the one described in (Charniak et al, 1998). $$$$$ If the old one is higher, nothing need be done.

Two grammars are equivalent if they define the same probability distribution over strings (Charniak et al, 1998). $$$$$ In Figure 4 we reproduce C&C's results on the percentage of sentences (length 18-26) parsed as a function of number of edges used.

On the other hand, the more complex, tuned FOM in (Charniak et al, 1998) is able to parse all of these sentences using around 2K edges, while BF requires 7K edges. $$$$$ For each of these new edges, we check to see if a matching constituent (i.e. a constituent with the same head, start, and end points) already exists in either the agenda or the chart.
