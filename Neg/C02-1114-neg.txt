This problem is addressed by Riloff and Shepherd (1997), Roark and Charniak (1998) and more recently byWiddows and Dorow (2002). $$$$$ A general problem for such cluster ing techniques lies in the question of how many clusters one should have, i.e. how many senses are appropriate for a particular word in a given domain (Manning and Schu?tze, 1999, Ch 14).

The senses of a word may then be discovered using graph clustering techniques (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), or algorithms such as HyperLex (Veronis, 2004) or Pagerank (Agirre et al, 2006). $$$$$ The graph used in the experiments described has 99,454 nodes (nouns) and 587,475 links.
