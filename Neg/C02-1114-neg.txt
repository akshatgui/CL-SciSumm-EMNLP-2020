The work by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) on lexical acquisition is similar to ours because they also use graph structures to learn semantic classes. $$$$$ For example, using WordNet to recognise that the word apple refers to a fruit or a tree is a grave error in the many situations where this word refers to a computer manufacturer, a sense which WordNet does notcover.
The work by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) on lexical acquisition is similar to ours because they also use graph structures to learn semantic classes. $$$$$ A general problem for such cluster ing techniques lies in the question of how many clusters one should have, i.e. how many senses are appropriate for a particular word in a given domain (Manning and Schu?tze, 1999, Ch 14).

This is the same general observation exploited by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), who try to find graph regions that are more connected internally than externally. $$$$$ Initially, grammatical relations between pairsof words were extracted.

The major guideline in this part of the evaluation was to compare our results with previous work having a similar goal (Widdows and Dorow, 2002). $$$$$ Breadth of cover age does not in itself solve this problem: general lexical resources such as WordNet can provide too many senses many of which are rarely used in particular domains or corpora (Gale et al, 1992).The graph model presented in this paper suggests a new method for recognising relevant polysemy.

The only difference from the (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) experiment is the usage of pairs rather than single words. $$$$$ Definition 3 Let G be a graph of words closely related to a seed-word w, and let G \ w be the subgraph which results from the removal of the seed-node w. The connected components of the subgraph G \ w are the senses of the word w with respect to the graph G. As an illustrative example, consider the localgraph generated for the word apple (6).
