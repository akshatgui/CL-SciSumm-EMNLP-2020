(Davidov et al, 2010) used 50 hash tags and 15 emoticons as noisy labels to create a dataset for twitter sentiment classification. $$$$$ Balog et al (2006) use the mood annotation of blog posts coupled with news datain order to discover the events that drive the dom inant moods expressed in blogs.
(Davidov et al, 2010) used 50 hash tags and 15 emoticons as noisy labels to create a dataset for twitter sentiment classification. $$$$$ We applied our framework with its FULL setting, learning the sentiment tags fromthe training set for hashtags and smileys (sepa rately) and executed the framework on the reduced Tweeter dataset (without untagged data) allowingit to identify at least five sentences for each senti ment class.In order to make the evaluation harsher, we re moved all tweets containing at least one of the relevant classification hashtags (or smileys).
(Davidov et al, 2010) used 50 hash tags and 15 emoticons as noisy labels to create a dataset for twitter sentiment classification. $$$$$ Mihalcea and Liu (2006) derive lists of words and phrases with happiness factor from a corpus of blog posts, where each post is annotated by the blogger with a mood label.
(Davidov et al, 2010) used 50 hash tags and 15 emoticons as noisy labels to create a dataset for twitter sentiment classification. $$$$$ In this paper we propose away to utilize such tagged Twitter data for classi fication of a wide variety of sentiment types from text.

 $$$$$ The Twitter dataset contains above 2.5 million dif ferent user-defined hashtags.
 $$$$$ Mishne used a much broader range of moods.
 $$$$$ See (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) for a short discussion.

Evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity $$$$$ 3.1.2 Pattern-based featuresOur main feature type is based on surface pat terns.
Evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity $$$$$ We utilize 50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys assentiment labels which allow us to build a classifier for dozens of sentiment types for short tex tual sentences.
Evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity $$$$$ We presented a framework which allows an au tomatic identification and classification of various sentiment types in short text fragments which isbased on Twitter data.
Evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity $$$$$ Automated identification of diverse sen timent types can be beneficial for manyNLP systems such as review summariza tion and public media analysis.

Davidov et al (2010) propose utilizing twitter hash tag and smileys to learn enhanced sentiment types. $$$$$ A feature is considered to be shared between two different senti ment labels if for both sentiment labels there is at least a single example in the training set whichhas a positive value of this feature.
Davidov et al (2010) propose utilizing twitter hash tag and smileys to learn enhanced sentiment types. $$$$$ Automated identification of diverse sen timent types can be beneficial for manyNLP systems such as review summariza tion and public media analysis.
Davidov et al (2010) propose utilizing twitter hash tag and smileys to learn enhanced sentiment types. $$$$$ We would like to estimate such inter-sentiment dependencies and overlap automatically from the labeled data.
Davidov et al (2010) propose utilizing twitter hash tag and smileys to learn enhanced sentiment types. $$$$$ We evaluate the contribution of different feature types for sentiment classification and show that our framework successfully identifies sentiment types of untagged sentences.
