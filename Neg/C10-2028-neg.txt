(Davidov et al, 2010) used 50 hash tags and 15 emoticons as noisy labels to create a dataset for twitter sentiment classification. $$$$$ While hashtag labels arespecific to Twitter data, the obtained feature vectors are not heavily Twitter-specific and in the fu ture we would like to explore the applicability ofTwitter data for sentiment multi-class identifica tion and classification in other domains.

 $$$$$ 5.3.2 Feature overlapIn our framework we have created a set of fea ture vectors for each of the Twitter sentiment tags.
 $$$$$ While still relatively low (0.31 for hashtags and 0.64 for smi leys), we observe much better performance forsmileys which is expected due to the lower num ber of sentiment types.
 $$$$$ Thus n-gram features al ways have a higher weight than features of their component words, and rare words have a higher weight than common words.

Evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity: the Stanford Twitter Sentiment set (Go et al, 2009), Davidov et al (2010) use 15 emoticons and 50 Twitter hash tags as proxies for sentiment in a similar manner, but their evaluation is indirect. $$$$$ We presented a framework which allows an au tomatic identification and classification of various sentiment types in short text fragments which isbased on Twitter data.
