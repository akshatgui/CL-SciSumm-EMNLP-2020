While most of earlier approaches rely on handcrafted rules or dictionaries, many recent works adopt machine learning approaches ,e.g, SVM (Lee, 2003), HMM (Zhou, 2004), Maximum Entropy (Lin, 2004) and CRF (Settles,2004), especially with the availability of annotated corpora such as GENIA, achieving state-of-the-art performance. $$$$$ In addition to orthography, the model could also benefit from generalized semantic word groups.

Genes/Proteins are not the Same Many of the existing BNER systems, which are mainly tuned for gene/protein identification, use features such as token shape (also known as word class and brief word class (Settles, 2004)), Greek alphabet matching, Roman number matching and so forth. $$$$$ For example, a feature may have a value of 0 in most cases, but given the text “the ATPase” it has the value 1 along the transition where si_1 corresponds to a state with the label OTHER, si corresponds to a state with the label PROTEIN, and fj is the feature function WORD=ATPase E o at position i in the sequence.
