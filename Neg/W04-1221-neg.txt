Settles (2004)'s CRF system deserves special note in the sense that it achieved comparable performance to top ranked systems with a rather simple feature set. $$$$$ One explanation is simply an issue of tokenization.
Settles (2004)'s CRF system deserves special note in the sense that it achieved comparable performance to top ranked systems with a rather simple feature set. $$$$$ This paper presents a framework for simultaneously recognizing occurrences of PROTEIN, DNA, RNA, CELL-LINE, and CELL-TYPE entity classes using Conditional Random Fields with a variety of traditional and novel features.

While most of earlier approaches rely on handcrafted rules or dictionaries, many recent works adopt machine learning approaches ,e.g, SVM (Lee, 2003), HMM (Zhou, 2004), Maximum Entropy (Lin, 2004) and CRF (Settles,2004), especially with the availability of annotated corpora such as GENIA, achieving state-of-the-art performance. $$$$$ This work is supported by NLM training grant 5T15LM007359-02 and NIH grant R01 LM07050-01.

Genes/Proteins are not the Same Many of the existing BNER systems, which are mainly tuned for gene/protein identification, use features such as token shape (also known as word class and brief word class (Settles, 2004)), Greek alphabet matching, Roman number matching and so forth. $$$$$ I have shown that a CRF-based model with only simple orthographic features can achieve performance near the current state of the art, while using semantic lexicons (as presented here) do not positively affect performance.$ While the system presented here shows promise, there is still much to be explored.

(Settles, 2004) reported that a system using a subset of features out performed one using a full set of features. $$$$$ It may be that keyword lexicons contributed to the model identifying these low frequency terms more accurately.
(Settles, 2004) reported that a system using a subset of features out performed one using a full set of features. $$$$$ I would like to thank my advisor Mark Craven for his advice and guidance, as well as Andrew McCallum and Aron Culotta for answering my questions about the MALLET system.
(Settles, 2004) reported that a system using a subset of features out performed one using a full set of features. $$$$$ Once these settings are found, the labeling for an new, unlabeled sequence can be done using a modified Viterbi algorithm.
(Settles, 2004) reported that a system using a subset of features out performed one using a full set of features. $$$$$ They have also just recently been applied to the more limited task of finding gene and protein mentions (McDonald and Pereira, 2004), with promising early results.

 $$$$$ Other feature functions that could have the value 1 along this transition are CAPITALIZED, MIXEDCASE, and SUFFIX=ase.

The features used in our experiments mainly follow the work of (Settles, 2004) and (Collins, 2001). $$$$$ “x antibody” vs. “x antibodies”) can cause problems for these rigid lexicons that require exact matching.
The features used in our experiments mainly follow the work of (Settles, 2004) and (Collins, 2001). $$$$$ While one abstract refers to “IL12,” others may write “IL-12” or “IL 12.” Similarly, the generalization of entities to groups (e.g.
The features used in our experiments mainly follow the work of (Settles, 2004) and (Collins, 2001). $$$$$ The deleterious effect of the semantic lexicons is surprising and puzzling.7 However, even though semantic lexicons slightly decrease overall performance, it is worthwhile to note that adding lexicons actually improves both recall and precision for the RNA and CELL-LINE entities.

Our performance of the single-phase CRF with maximum likelihood training is 69.44%, which agrees with (Settles, 2004) who also uses similar settings. $$$$$ To that end, named entity recognition (the task of identifying words and phrases in free text that belong to certain classes of interest) is an important first step for many of these larger information management goals.
Our performance of the single-phase CRF with maximum likelihood training is 69.44%, which agrees with (Settles, 2004) who also uses similar settings. $$$$$ Also of note is that, in both experiments, the CRF framework achieves somewhat comparable performance across all entities.

 $$$$$ It may be that keyword lexicons contributed to the model identifying these low frequency terms more accurately.
 $$$$$ In short, I have presented in detail a framework for recognizing multiple entity classes in biomedical abstracts with Conditional Random Fields.
 $$$$$ With all this information at the model’s disposal, it can still be difficult to properly disambiguate between these entities.

The named entity tagger used throughout in this section is based on Conditional Random Fields and similar to the one presented by (Settles, 2004). $$$$$ Richer syntactic information such as shallow parsing may be useful.
The named entity tagger used throughout in this section is based on Conditional Random Fields and similar to the one presented by (Settles, 2004). $$$$$ For example, the acronym “EPC” appears in these static lexicons both as a protein (“eosinophil cationic protein” [sic]) and as a cell line (“epithelioma papulosum cyprini”).
The named entity tagger used throughout in this section is based on Conditional Random Fields and similar to the one presented by (Settles, 2004). $$$$$ All words for which the null hypothesis is rejected with a p-value < 0.005 are added to the keyword lexicon for its majority class.

Hence, the use of a named entity tagger supports the evaluation results when comparing the various biomedical entity recognition (Settles, 2004). $$$$$ This work is supported by NLM training grant 5T15LM007359-02 and NIH grant R01 LM07050-01.
