For example, Goodman (1997) suggests using a coarse grammar consisting of regular non-terminals, such as NP and VP, and then non-terminals augmented with head-word information for the more accurate second-pass grammar. $$$$$ On the other hand, all nodes in the agenda parser were compared to all other nodes, so in some sense all the priority functions were global.

The terms alpha and beta are the thresholds of the number and the beam width of lexical entries, and theta is the beam width for global thresholding (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ Therefore, we should use the inside probability as our metric of performance; however inside probabilities can become very close to zero, so instead we measure entropy, the negative logarithm of the inside probability.
The terms alpha and beta are the thresholds of the number and the beam width of lexical entries, and theta is the beam width for global thresholding (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ Thus, we looked for a surrogate measure, and decided to use the total inside probability of all parses, which, with no thresholding, is just the probability of the sentence given the model.

However, if many iterations are required to obtain a parse, the utility of starting with a low beam and iterating becomes questionable (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ In a probabilistic framework where almost every node will have some (possibly very small) probability, we can rephrase this requirement as being that the node must be part of a reasonably probable sequence.

A prime example of this idea is from Goodman (1997), who describes a method for producing a simple but crude approximate grammar of a standard context-free grammar. $$$$$ The first section of the algorithm works forwards, computing, for each i, f [i], which contains the score of the best sequence covering terminals ti...ti-i Thus f[n+1] contains the score of the best sequence covering the whole sentence, maxi, P(L).

However, M1 is usually not preferred in practice (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ Because we have already eliminated many nodes in our first pass, the second pass can run much faster, and, despite the fact that we have to run two passes, the added savings in the second pass can easily outweigh the cost of the first one.
However, M1 is usually not preferred in practice (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ In the second pass, for each production 21n this paper, we will assume that each second pass nonterminal can descend from at most one first pass nonterminal in each cell.
