Our general estimation method also has practical applications in cases one uses a probabilistic context-free grammar to approximate strictly more powerful rewriting systems, as for instance probabilistic tree adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992). $$$$$ The Bell System Technical Journal, 27(3):379-423.

In recent years, the statistical parsing community has begun to reach out; for syntactic formalisms that recognize the individuality of words, link grammars (Sleator and &apos; Pemperley, 1991) and lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992) have now received stochastic treatments. $$$$$ lndexed grammars - An extension to context free grammars.
