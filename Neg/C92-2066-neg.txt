Our general estimation method also has practical applications in cases one uses a probabilistic context-free grammar to approximate strictly more powerful rewriting systems, as for instance probabilistic tree adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992). $$$$$ If b\[$r/\] ~ a, I(b,7, i , - , - , I ) = dl if / = i+ 1 and if.

Examples of the first approach can be seen most clearly with the usage of CNF grammars by the Inside-Outside algorithm (Pereira and Schabes, 1992, Lari and Young, 1990). $$$$$ Lari, K. and S. J. Young.
