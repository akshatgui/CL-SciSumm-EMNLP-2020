However, POS taggers for Twitter are only available for a limited number of languages such as English (Gimpel et al, 2011). $$$$$ We see that Twitter-specific tags have strong positional preferences: at-mentions (@) and Twitter discourse markers (—) tend to occur towards the beginning of messages, whereas URLs (U), emoticons (E), and categorizing hashtags (#) tend to occur near the end.

Table 3: Explicit requests for sharing (where only occurrences POS-tagged as verbs count, according to the Gimpel et al (2011) tagger). $$$$$ We randomly divided the set of 1,827 annotated tweets into a training set of 1,000 (14,542 tokens), a development set of 327 (4,770 tokens), and a test set of 500 (7,124 tokens).

This poses considerable problems for traditional NLP tools, which we redeveloped with other domains in mind, which of ten make strong assumptions about orthographic uniformity (i.e., there is just one way to spell you).

We crowd source the training section of the data from Gimpel et al (2011) 2 with POS tags. $$$$$ Since Twitter includes many alternate spellings of words, we used the Metaphone algorithm (Philips, 1990)9 to create a coarse phonetic normalization of words to simpler keys.
