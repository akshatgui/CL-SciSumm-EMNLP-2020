However, POS taggers for Twitter are only available for a limited number of languages such as English (Gimpel et al, 2011). $$$$$ For Stage 0, we developed a set of 20 coarse-grained tags based on several treebanks but with some additional categories specific to Twitter, including URLs and hashtags.

Table 3 $$$$$ Therefore, we opted not to split contractions or possessives, as is common in English corpus preprocessing; rather, we introduced four new tags for combined forms: {nominal, proper noun} x {verb, possessive}.5 The final tagging scheme (Table 1) encompasses 25 tags.

This poses considerable problems for traditional NLP tools, which we redeveloped with other domains in mind, which of ten make strong assumptions about orthographic uniformity (i.e., there is just one way to spell you).

More specifically, we had lay annotators on the crowd sourcing platform Crowdflower re-annotate the training section of Gimpel et al (2011). $$$$$ The miscellaneous category G includes multiword abbreviations that do not fit in any of the other categories, like ily (I love you), as well as partial words, artifacts of tokenization errors, miscellaneous symbols, possessive endings,6 and arrows that are not used as discourse markers.

In this work, we focus on Twitter because the labeled corpus by Gimpel et al (2011) allows us to quantitatively evaluate our approach. $$$$$ However, the bulk of this work eschews the standard pipeline of tools which might enable a richer linguistic analysis; such tools are typically trained on newstext and have been shown to perform poorly on Twitter (Finin et al., 2010).
