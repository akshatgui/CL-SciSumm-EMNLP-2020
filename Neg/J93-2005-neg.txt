Pustejovsky confronted with the problem of automatic acquisition more extensively in [Pustejovsky et al 1993]. $$$$$ An initial experiment on a subset of the Wall Street Journal Corpus, for example, shows that said has a quite different metonymic distribution there, reported in Figure 9.

Pustejovsky confronted with the problem of automatic acquisition more extensively in [Pustejovsky et al 1993]. $$$$$ To understand fully the experiments described in the next two sections, we will refer to several semantic notions introduced in previous sections.

We inferred the bracketing by modifying an algorithm initially proposed by Pustejovsky et al (1993). $$$$$ It should be pointed out that these qualia values do not carry event place variables, since such discrimination was beyond the scope of this experiment.

The bracketing problem for noun-noun-noun compounds has been investigated by Liberrnan (1992), Pustejovsky et al (1993). $$$$$ We would like to thank Scott Waterman for his assistance in preparing the statistics.
The bracketing problem for noun-noun-noun compounds has been investigated by Liberrnan (1992), Pustejovsky et al (1993). $$$$$ In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference relations can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.
The bracketing problem for noun-noun-noun compounds has been investigated by Liberrnan (1992), Pustejovsky et al (1993). $$$$$ Mr. Smale, who ordinarily insists on a test market before a national roll-out, told the team to go ahead—although he said he was skeptical that Pringle's could survive, Mr. Tucker says.
The bracketing problem for noun-noun-noun compounds has been investigated by Liberrnan (1992), Pustejovsky et al (1993). $$$$$ We first presented a representation language for lexical knowledge, the generative lexicon, and demonstrated how it facilitates the structuring of lexical relations among words, looking in particular at the problems of metonymy and polysemy.

(Pustejovsky et al., 1993) points out that the existing approaches to resolving the ambiguity of noun phrases fall roughly into two camps: adjacency and dependency. $$$$$ Here we employ the tools of semantic analysis from Section 1 to examine the behavior of metonymy with reporting verbs.
(Pustejovsky et al., 1993) points out that the existing approaches to resolving the ambiguity of noun phrases fall roughly into two camps: adjacency and dependency. $$$$$ Metonymy can be seen as a case of &quot;licensed violation&quot; of selectional restrictions.
(Pustejovsky et al., 1993) points out that the existing approaches to resolving the ambiguity of noun phrases fall roughly into two camps: adjacency and dependency. $$$$$ The initial seeding of lexical structures is being done independently both from the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (OALD) and from lexical entries in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (Procter, Ilson, and Ayto 1978).
(Pustejovsky et al., 1993) points out that the existing approaches to resolving the ambiguity of noun phrases fall roughly into two camps: adjacency and dependency. $$$$$ Such a framework for lexical knowledge suggests that there are richer relationships among words in text beyond that of simple co-occurrence that can be extracted automatically.

 $$$$$ These are interesting because regardless of the noun type appearing as complement, it is embedded within a semantic interpretation of &quot;the proposal to,&quot; thereby clothing the complement within an intensional context.
 $$$$$ Thus, in this example, the type selected for by a verb such as read refers to the &quot;information&quot; argument for tape, while a verb such as carry would select for the &quot;physical object&quot; argument.
 $$$$$ The question then

 $$$$$ In particular, we will discuss a phenomenon we call discourse polarity, and how corpus-based experiments provide clues toward the representation of this phenomenon, as well as information on preference relations.
 $$$$$ This is an example of subject type coercion, where the semantics for Dow Corp as a company must specify that there is a human typically associated with such official pronouncements (see Section 5).12 For one set of experiments, we used a corpus of approximately 3,000 articles written by Digital Equipment Corporation's Customer Support Specialists for an on-line computer troubleshooting library.

Finally, (Pustejovsky et al, 1993) present an interesting framework for the acquisition of semantic relations from corpora not only relying on statistics, but guided by theoretical lexicon principles. $$$$$ In this view, a noun such as tape would have the following qualia structure: This states that a tape is an &quot;information container&quot; that is also a two-dimensional physical object, where the information is written onto the object.'
Finally, (Pustejovsky et al, 1993) present an interesting framework for the acquisition of semantic relations from corpora not only relying on statistics, but guided by theoretical lexicon principles. $$$$$ What these data show is that the highest count complement types match the type required by the verb; namely, that one vetoes a bill or proposal to do something, not the thing itself.
Finally, (Pustejovsky et al, 1993) present an interesting framework for the acquisition of semantic relations from corpora not only relying on statistics, but guided by theoretical lexicon principles. $$$$$ We would also like to thank Mats Rooth, Scott Waterman, and four anonymous reviewers for useful comments and discussion.
Finally, (Pustejovsky et al, 1993) present an interesting framework for the acquisition of semantic relations from corpora not only relying on statistics, but guided by theoretical lexicon principles. $$$$$ This entry states that in the REPORTING—VERB sense of the word, insist is a relation between an individual and a statement that is the negation of a proposition, /p, presupposed in the context of the utterance.

The best known early work on automated unsupervised NC bracketing is that of Lauer (1995) who introduces the probabilistic dependency model for the syntactic disambiguation of NCs and argues against the adjacency model, proposed by Marcus (1980), Pustejovsky et al (1993) and Resnik (1993). $$$$$ For example, the set of expressions involving the word &quot;tape&quot; in the context of its use as a secondary storage device suggests that it fits the container artifact schema of the qualia structure, with &quot;information&quot; and &quot;file&quot; as its containees: As mentioned in Section 1, containers tend to appear as objects of the prepositions to, from, in, and on as well as in direct object position, in which case they are typically serving metonymically for the containee.

Pustejovsky et al (1993) show how statistical techniques, such as mutual information measures can contribute to automatically acquire lexical information regarding the link between a noun and a predicate. $$$$$ We demonstrate how a semantic framework for lexical knowledge can suggest richer relationships among words in text beyond that of simple co-occurrence.
Pustejovsky et al (1993) show how statistical techniques, such as mutual information measures can contribute to automatically acquire lexical information regarding the link between a noun and a predicate. $$$$$ The examples in Figure 5 with the verb veto indicate two things: first, that such coercions are regular and pervasive in corpora; second, that almost anything can be vetoed, but that the most frequently occurring objects are closest to the type selected by the verb.
Pustejovsky et al (1993) show how statistical techniques, such as mutual information measures can contribute to automatically acquire lexical information regarding the link between a noun and a predicate. $$$$$ This process and the corpus tuning for both argument typing and subcategorization acquisition are described in Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky (1992) and Pustejovsky et al. (1992).
Pustejovsky et al (1993) show how statistical techniques, such as mutual information measures can contribute to automatically acquire lexical information regarding the link between a noun and a predicate. $$$$$ Using techniques described in Church and Hindle (1990), Church and Hanks (1990), and Hindle and Rooth (1991), Figure 4 shows some examples of the most frequent V-0 pairs from the AP corpus.

 $$$$$ Finally, we discuss the potential that corpus studies have for enriching the data set for theoretical linguistic research, as well as helping to confirm or disconfirm linguistic hypotheses.
 $$$$$ We would like to thank Scott Waterman for his assistance in preparing the statistics.
 $$$$$ We reasoned that, if the alternation is based on the container/containee metonymy, then it will be those verbs that apply to the telic role of the direct object that participate in the alternation.
 $$$$$ Unlike with purely statistical collocational analyses, the framework of a semantic theory allows the automatic construction of predictions about deeper semantic relationships among words appearing in collocational systems.

For example, Pustejovsky et al (1993) use generalized syntactic patterns for extracting qualia structures from a partially parsed corpus. $$$$$ These devices and the associated dictionary make up a generative lexicon, where semantic information is distributed throughout the lexicon to all categories.
For example, Pustejovsky et al (1993) use generalized syntactic patterns for extracting qualia structures from a partially parsed corpus. $$$$$ These are semantic n-grams rather than direct interpretations of the prepositions.
For example, Pustejovsky et al (1993) use generalized syntactic patterns for extracting qualia structures from a partially parsed corpus. $$$$$ As we have seen, providing a representational system for lexical semantic relations is a nontrivial task.

Concerning relatedness measure, additional corpus-based measures such as Web-basedmeasures (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007) or measures based on syntactic relations (Pustejovsky et al, 1993) could appear to be useful for improving the ranking of the extracted relations. $$$$$ In this example we look at the behavior of noun phrases and the prepositional phrases that follow them.
