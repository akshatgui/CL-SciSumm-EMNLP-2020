An historical account of this empirical renaissance is provide in [Church and Mercer, 1993]. $$$$$ There has been a long tradition of empiricist approaches in lexicography, both bilingual and monolingual, dating back to Johnson and Murray.
An historical account of this empirical renaissance is provide in [Church and Mercer, 1993]. $$$$$ Rather, the knowledge-based approach was advocated as necessary in order to deal with the lack of allophonic invariance.
An historical account of this empirical renaissance is provide in [Church and Mercer, 1993]. $$$$$ Empiricism is, of course, a very old tradition.

However, using more data usually leads to better results, or how Church and Mercer (1993) put it more data are better data?. $$$$$ Hear!&quot; Fortunately, though, it is extremely unlikely that these unwanted phrases will appear much more often than chance across a range of other corpora such as Department of Energy (DOE) abstracts or the Associated Press (AP) news.
However, using more data usually leads to better results, or how Church and Mercer (1993) put it more data are better data?. $$$$$ It is an interesting fact that most of the authors of the knowledgebased papers in Chapter 5 of Waibel and Lee (1990) have a university affiliation whereas most of the authors of the data-intensive papers in Chapter 6 have an industrial affiliation.

which has commonly been used in the recent statistical NLP research (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Consider the trivial sentence, &quot;I see a bird,&quot; where every word is almost unambiguous.
which has commonly been used in the recent statistical NLP research (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ There are three papers in these special issues on aligning bilingual texts such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary debates) that are available in both English and French: Brown et al. (1993), Gale and Church (this issue), and Kay and Rosenschein (this issue).

 $$$$$ Here, again, the trigram model still accounts for all of the context there is and so should be doing as well as any model can.
 $$$$$ The parameters of the channel model, Pr(F I E), are estimated from a parallel text that has been aligned by an automatic procedure that figures out which parts of the source text correspond to which parts of the target text.

Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ .
Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ In general, phrase structure is probably more important for understanding who did what to whom, than recognizing what was said.'
Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ First computers are much more powerful and more available than they were in the 1950s when empiricist ideas were first applied to problems in language, or in the 1970s and 1980s, when data-intensive methods were too expensive for researchers working in universities.
Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Firth, a leading figure in British linguistics during the 1950s, summarized the approach with the memorable line: &quot;You shall know a word by the company it keeps&quot; (Firth 1957).

Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ This is especially significant given that abstracts for this meeting were due just a few months after the release of the corpus, attesting to the speech recognition community's hunger for standard corpora for development and evaluation.
Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Many of the same statistical techniques (e.g., Shannon's Noisy Channel Model, n-gram models, hidden Markov models (HMMs), entropy (H), mutual information (I), Student's t-score) have appeared in one form or another, often first in speech, and then soon thereafter in language.
Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ And moreover, if we insist on throwing out idiosyncratic data, we may find it very difficult to collect any data at all, since all corpora have their quirks.
