An historical account of this empirical renaissance is provide in [Church and Mercer, 1993]. $$$$$ Similar comments hold for collocation studies, as illustrated in Table 8, which shows mutual information values (Fano 1961; p. 28) for several collocations in a number of different corpora.

An historical account of this empirical renaissance is provide in [Church and Mercer, 1993]. $$$$$ This is a much weaker and more realistic requirement than the more standard (and more idealistic) practice of balancing and purging quirks.

However, using more data usually leads to better results, or how Church and Mercer (1993) put it more data are better data?. $$$$$ It is possible that much of this work was actually inspired by Turing's code-breaking efforts during World War II, but we may never know for sure given the necessity for secrecy.

which has commonly been used in the recent statistical NLP research (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ There has been a long tradition of empiricist approaches in lexicography, both bilingual and monolingual, dating back to Johnson and Murray.

which has commonly been used in the recent statistical NLP research (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Text Analysis has also prospered because of its tradition of evaluating performance with theoretically motivated numerical measures such as entropy.

 $$$$$ Hear!&quot; Fortunately, though, it is extremely unlikely that these unwanted phrases will appear much more often than chance across a range of other corpora such as Department of Energy (DOE) abstracts or the Associated Press (AP) news.
 $$$$$ Suppose that the coin comes up heads with probability p. Then the probability that it will come up heads exactly m times in n tosses is Here which is called the binomial coefficient, is the number of ways the m positions can be chosen from the n coin tosses.
 $$$$$ It is possible that much of this work was actually inspired by Turing's code-breaking efforts during World War II, but we may never know for sure given the necessity for secrecy.
 $$$$$ Murray, the editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, complained: The editor or his assistants have to search for precious hours for examples of common words, which readers passed by...

Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Rather than rely on guesses for the values of the bonuses and penalties as the Raleigh group had done, the Yorktown group used three levels of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to compute the conditional probabilities necessary for the noisy channel.
Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Text Analysis focuses on broad (though possibly superficial) coverage of unrestricted text, rather than deep analysis of (artificially) restricted domains.

Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ As a result of a number of data collection and related efforts such as ACL/DCI, BNC, CLR, Ed, EDR, LDC, ICAME, NERC, and TEI, most researchers should now be able to make use of a number of very respectable machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) and text corpora.

Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ At BBN, researchers called their system HWIM for (Hear What I Mean).
Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Weaver (1949) was the first to propose an information theoretic approach to MT.
