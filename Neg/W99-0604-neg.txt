To obtain the best single alignment, it is common practice to use a post-hoc algorithm to merge these directional alignments (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ In principal, when re-ordering words of the source string, words of the German verb group could be moved over punctuation marks, although it was penalized by a constant cost.

The most common techniques for bidirectional alignment are post-hoc combinations, such as union or intersection, of directional models, (Och et al, 1999), or more complex heuristic combiners such as grow-diag-final (Koehn et al, 2003). $$$$$ Considering the recognition word error rate of 31% the degradation of about 20% by speech input can be expected.

We view our use of part-of-speech patterns as a natural extension to the introduction of structural elements to statistical machine translation by Wang [1998] and Och et al [1999]. $$$$$ The basic idea is to model two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words within these phrases.
We view our use of part-of-speech patterns as a natural extension to the introduction of structural elements to statistical machine translation by Wang [1998] and Och et al [1999]. $$$$$ The result of this search is a mapping: j (a3, ea,), where each source word is mapped to a target position a3 and a word ea, at this position.
We view our use of part-of-speech patterns as a natural extension to the introduction of structural elements to statistical machine translation by Wang [1998] and Och et al [1999]. $$$$$ Within the translation search, we will introduce suitably restricted permutations of the source string, to satisfy this requirement.

The translation models and lexical scores were estimated on the training corpus which was automatically aligned using Giza++ (Och et al, 1999) in both directions between source and target and symmetrised using the growing heuristic (Koehn et al, 2003). $$$$$ In section 4 we compare the two methods using the Verbmobil task.

Zens et al (2004) introduce a left-to-right decoding algorithm with ITG constraints on the alignment template system (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ In the previous section, we have described the alignment within the phrases.

A significant source of errors in statistical machine translation is the word reordering problem (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ Therefore, for text input, each sentence is split into shorter units using the punctuation marks.

A significant source of errors in statistical machine translation is the word reordering problem (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ To improve the lexicon probabilities and to account for unseen words we added a manually created German-English dictionary with 13 388 entries.

The blocks are simpler than the alignment templates in (Och et al, 1999) in that they do not have any internal structure. $$$$$ Using this new vocabulary, we then perform the stan2.3 Extension to Handle Non-Monotonicity Our approach assumes that the alignment is monotone with respect to the word order for the lion's share of all word alignments.

We take the intersection of the two alignments as described in (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ The optimal translation is obtained by carrying out the following optimization: where J is the length of the input sentence and $ is a symbol denoting the sentence end.
We take the intersection of the two alignments as described in (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ When aligning the words in parallel texts (for IndoEuropean language pairs like Spanish-English, French-English, Italian-German,...), we typically observe a strong localization effect.

We use another technique to speed up direct search by storing and re-using search graphs, which consist of lattices in the case of phrase-based decoding (Och et al, 1999) and hypergraphs in the case of hierarchical decoding (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ As a result the context of words has a greater influence and the changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly.

The phrase extraction heuristic then extracts all the bi phrases that are compatible with the word alignment (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ We count all phrase-pairs of the training corpus which are consistent with the alignment matrix determined in step 2.
The phrase extraction heuristic then extracts all the bi phrases that are compatible with the word alignment (Och et al, 1999). $$$$$ A score of 0.0 means that the translation is semantically and syntactically correct, a score of 0.5 means that a sentence is semantically correct but syntactically wrong and a score of 1.0 means that the sentence is semantically wrong.

 $$$$$ The length model is implicitly given by the alignment probabilities.

Only phrases that conform to the so-called consistent alignment restrictions (Och et al, 1999) are extracted. $$$$$ The average translation time on an Alpha workstation for a single sentence is about one second for the alignment template appreach and 30 seconds for the single-word based search procedure.
