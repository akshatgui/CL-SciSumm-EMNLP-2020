 $$$$$ One important part of the matrix package will be a library of phenomenon-based analyses drawn from the existing grammars and over time from users of the matrix, to provide working examples of how the matrix can be applied and extended.

The SRG is implemented within the Linguistic Knowledge Building (LKB) system (Copestake, 2002), based on the basic components of the grammar Matrix, an open source starter-kit for the development of HPSG grammars developed as part of the LinGO consortium's multilingual grammar engineering (Bender et al, 2002). $$$$$ Moreover, the central role of types in the representation of linguistic generalizations enables the kind of underspecification which is useful for expressing what is common among related languages while allowing for the further specialization which necessarily distinguishes one language from another.

What I am reporting is thus a perspective on work done primarily by Flickinger within the English Resource Grammar (ERG $$$$$ Grammars which have been under development for many years tend to be very difficult to mine for information, as they contain layers upon layers of interacting analyses and decisions made in light of various intermediate stages of the grammar.
What I am reporting is thus a perspective on work done primarily by Flickinger within the English Resource Grammar (ERG $$$$$ Where there are several equivalent analyses of the same linguistic phenomena (e.g., morphosyntactic ambiguity or optionality), the choice of analysis can have processing implications that aren’t necessarily apparent in a single grammar.
What I am reporting is thus a perspective on work done primarily by Flickinger within the English Resource Grammar (ERG $$$$$ More importantly, the grammar matrix will help to remove one of the primary remaining obstacles to commercial deployment of grammars of this type and indeed of the commercial use of deep linguistic analysis: the immense cost of developing the resource.

In this paper I shall present a treatment of lexical and grammatical tone and vowel length in Hausa, as implemented in an emerging bidirectional HPSG of the language based on the Lingo Grammar Matrix (Bender et al, 2002). $$$$$ We have produced a preliminary version of the grammar matrix relying heavily on the LinGO project’s English Resource Grammar, and to a lesser extent on the Japanese grammar developed jointly between DFKI Saarbr¨ucken (Germany) and YY Technologies (Mountain View, CA).
In this paper I shall present a treatment of lexical and grammatical tone and vowel length in Hausa, as implemented in an emerging bidirectional HPSG of the language based on the Lingo Grammar Matrix (Bender et al, 2002). $$$$$ But the matrix itself may well change in parallel with the development of the grammar for a particular language, so appropriate mechanisms must be developed to support the merging of enhancements to both.

To better understand the needs of grammar developers we carefully explored two existing grammars $$$$$ As such, it cannot be tested directly on corpora from particular languages, and we must find other means of evaluation.
To better understand the needs of grammar developers we carefully explored two existing grammars $$$$$ The initial version of the matrix, while sufficient to support some useful grammar work, will require substantial further development on several fronts, including lexical representation, syntactic generalization, sociolinguistic variation, processing issues, and evaluation.

The LinGO Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al., 2002) is situated within the DELPH-IN2 collaboration and is both a repository of reusable linguistic knowledge and a method of delivering this knowledge to a user in the form of an extensible precision implemented grammar. $$$$$ Through their supertype headmod-phr-simple they inherit information common to many types of phrases, including the basic feature geometry, head feature and non-local feature passing, and semantic compositionality.

We share grammar libraries with the Grammar Matrix in the grammar (Bender et al, 2002) as the foundation of KRG2. $$$$$ Although small, this preliminary version of the matrix already reflects the main goals of the project: (i) Consistent with other work in HPSG, semantic representations and in particular the syntax-semantics interface are developed in detail; (ii) the types of the matrix are each representations of generalizations across linguistic objects and across languages; and (iii) the richness of the matrix and the incorporation of files which connect it with the LKB allow for extremely quick start-up as the matrix is applied to new languages.

 $$$$$ Second, having a set ofwide-coverage HPSGs with fairly standardized fundamentals could prove interesting for research on stochastic processing and disambiguation, especially if the languages differ in gross typological features such as word order.
 $$$$$ This lack of documentation holds across frameworks, with certain notable exceptions, including Alshawi (1992), M¨uller (1999), and Butt, King, Ni˜no, & Segond (1999).
 $$$$$ Examples to be included in the first release of this library include numeral classifiers in Japanese, subject pro drop in Spanish, partial-VP fronting in German, and verb diathesis in Norwegian.
 $$$$$ The linguistic interest lies in the HPSG community’s general bottom-up approach to language universals, which involves aiming for good coverage of a variety of languages first, and leaving the task of what they have in common for later.

To this end, the Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al, 2002) has been developed which, through a set of questionnaires, allows grammar engineers to quickly produce a core grammar for a language of their choice. $$$$$ The two English examples in (1) exemplify the difference between intersective and scopal modification:1 The MRSs for (1a-b) (abstracting away from agreement information) are given in (2) and (3).

In this research, we focus particularly on the Grammar Matrix-based DELPH-IN family of grammars (Bender et al, 2002), which includes grammars of English, Japanese, Norwegian, Modern Greek, Portuguese and Korean. $$$$$ The main goal of evaluation is, of course, to improve the matrix over time.

 $$$$$ Despite being couched in the same general framework and in some cases being written in the same formalism and consequently being compatible with the same parsing and generation software, these grammars were developed more or less independently of each other.
 $$$$$ There is also practical industrial benefit to this project.
 $$$$$ As part of the LinGO consortium’s multi-lingual grammar engineering effort, we are developing a ‘grammar matrix’ or starter-kit, distilling the wisdom of existing grammars and codifying and documenting it in a form that can be used as the basis for new grammars.

However, developing such grammars has been made much more efficient with the emergence of the Grammar Matrix (Bender et al,2002). $$$$$ Furthermore, it takes a handle (h8) rather than the event variable of the study-rel as its argument. h8 is equal modulo quantifiers (QEQ) to the handle of the study-rel (h9), and h7 is equal modulo quantifiers to the argument of the prpstn-rel (h2).
