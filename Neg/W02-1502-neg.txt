 $$$$$ Grammars which have been under development for many years tend to be very difficult to mine for information, as they contain layers upon layers of interacting analyses and decisions made in light of various intermediate stages of the grammar.
 $$$$$ This early version of the matrix comprises the following comIncluded with the matrix are configuration and parameter files for the LKB grammar engineering environment (Copestake, 2002).
 $$$$$ Tim Baldwin, Ann Copestake, Ivan Sag, Tom Wasow, and other members of the LinGO Laboratory at CSLI have had a great deal of influence on the design of the grammatical analyses and corresponding MRS representations.
 $$$$$ The following three strategies (meant to be used in combination) seem promising: (i) segregate changes that are important to sync to (e.g., changes that affect MRS outputs, fundamental changes to important analyses), (ii) develop a methodology for communicating changes in the matrix, their motivation and their implementation to the user community, and (iii) develop tools for semi-automating resynching of existing grammars to upgrades of the matrix.

The SRG is implemented within the Linguistic Knowledge Building (LKB) system (Copestake, 2002), based on the basic components of the grammar Matrix, an open source starter-kit for the development of HPSG grammars developed as part of the LinGO consortium's multilingual grammar engineering (Bender et al, 2002). $$$$$ Rob Malouf, Jeff Smith, John Beavers, and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler have contributed to the LinGO ERG; Melanie Siegel is the original developer for the Japanese grammar.

What I am reporting is thus a perspective on work done primarily by Flickinger within the English Resource Grammar (ERG: Flickinger (2000)) and by Bender in the context of the Grammar Matrix (Bender et al, 2002), though I've been involved in many of the discussions. $$$$$ We have produced a preliminary version of the grammar matrix relying heavily on the LinGO project’s English Resource Grammar, and to a lesser extent on the Japanese grammar developed jointly between DFKI Saarbr¨ucken (Germany) and YY Technologies (Mountain View, CA).

In this paper I shall present a treatment of lexical and grammatical tone and vowel length in Hausa, as implemented in an emerging bidirectional HPSG of the language based on the Lingo Grammar Matrix (Bender et al, 2002). $$$$$ Examples to be included in the first release of this library include numeral classifiers in Japanese, subject pro drop in Spanish, partial-VP fronting in German, and verb diathesis in Norwegian.

To better understand the needs of grammar developers we carefully explored two existing grammars: the LINGO grammar matrix (Bender et al,2002), which is a basis grammar for the rapid development of cross-linguistically consistent grammars; and a grammar of a fragment of Modern Hebrew, focusing on inverted constructions (Melnik, 2006). $$$$$ Since the grammar matrix draws on prior research and existing grammars, it necessarily reflects contributions from many people.

The LinGO Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al., 2002) is situated within the DELPH-IN2 collaboration and is both a repository of reusable linguistic knowledge and a method of delivering this knowledge to a user in the form of an extensible precision implemented grammar. $$$$$ Each case study will be a set of grammar files, simplified for relevance, along with documentation of the analysis, and a test suite of sample sentences which define the range of data covered by the analysis.

We share grammar libraries with the Grammar Matrix in the grammar (Bender et al, 2002) as the foundation of KRG2. $$$$$ First there is the question of what formal devices the grammar matrix will require.

 $$$$$ Tim Baldwin, Ann Copestake, Ivan Sag, Tom Wasow, and other members of the LinGO Laboratory at CSLI have had a great deal of influence on the design of the grammatical analyses and corresponding MRS representations.
 $$$$$ These types also have subtypes in the matrix specifying the two word-order possibilities (pre- or post-head modifiers), giving a total of four subtypes.2 The most important difference between these types is in the treatment of the handle of the head daughter’s semantics, to distinguish intersective and scopal modification.
 $$$$$ The user groups have suggested refinements and extensions of the basic inventory, and it is expected that general solutions, as they are identified jointly, will propagate into the existing grammars too.

To this end, the Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al, 2002) has been developed which, through a set of questionnaires, allows grammar engineers to quickly produce a core grammar for a language of their choice. $$$$$ Tim Baldwin, Ann Copestake, Ivan Sag, Tom Wasow, and other members of the LinGO Laboratory at CSLI have had a great deal of influence on the design of the grammatical analyses and corresponding MRS representations.

In this research, we focus particularly on the Grammar Matrix-based DELPH-IN family of grammars (Bender et al, 2002), which includes grammars of English, Japanese, Norwegian, Modern Greek, Portuguese and Korean. $$$$$ The matrix itself is not a grammar but a collection of generalizations across grammars.

 $$$$$ User feedback will already come in the form of case studies for the library as discussed in Section 5 above, but also potentially in proposals for modification of the matrix drawing on experiences in grammar development.
 $$$$$ As a result, when embarking on the creation of a new grammar for another language, it seems almost easier to start from scratch than to try to model it on an existing grammar.
 $$$$$ But the intent is to seed this classification scheme with a set of relatively coarse-grained phenomenon classes drawn from the existing grammars, then refine the typology as it is applied to these and new grammars built using the matrix.

However, developing such grammars has been made much more efficient with the emergence of the Grammar Matrix (Bender et al,2002). $$$$$ Despite being couched in the same general framework and in some cases being written in the same formalism and consequently being compatible with the same parsing and generation software, these grammars were developed more or less independently of each other.
