Other approaches combine lattices or N-best lists from several different MT systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ A less ambitious version of this idea would be to run the low-scoring engines only where there are gaps in the normally high-scoring engines.
Other approaches combine lattices or N-best lists from several different MT systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ However, this is predicated on the availability of a &quot;paraphraser&quot; system, developing which is not a trivial task.

Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) produced the first MEMT system by combining outputs from three different MT engines based on their knowledge of the inner workings of the engines. $$$$$ In every case, the base score produced by the scoring functions is currently multiplied by the length of the candidate in words, on the assumption that longer items are better.

Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997), named entity recognition (Borthwick et al, 1998), partial parsing (Inui and Inui, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002) and question answering (Chu-Carroll et al, 2003). $$$$$ The difference in keystrokes was calculated as follows: one keystroke for deleting a character; two 'The CMAT editor may also include translations from other candidates, lower in the menu, if they have the same boundaries as the chosen candidate and the menu is not too long. keystrokes for inserting a character; three keystrokes for deleting a word (in an editor with mouse action); three keystrokes plus the number of characters in the word being inserted for inserting a word.

Brown and Frederking (1995) is a continuation of Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) with an addition of a n-gram based mechanism for a candidate selection. $$$$$ The best method we could find was counting the number of keystrokes in the TWS to convert the outputs of individual engines and the multi-engine configuration to a &quot;canonical&quot; human translation.

The first example of this approach was the multi-engine MT system (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), which builds a chart using the translation units inside each input system and then uses a chart walk algorithm to find the best cover of the source sentence. Rosti et al (2007a) collect source-to-target correspondences from the input systems, create a new translation option table using only these phrases, and re-decode the source sentence to generate better translations. $$$$$ As mentioned above, Figure 2 shows the sets of candidates in the best chart walk that are presented as choices to the human user through the CMAT editor in our example.

System combination procedures, on the other hand, generate translations from the output of multiple component systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ A sample test on a passage of 2060 characters from the June 1993 evaluation of Pangloss is shown in figure 6.

In Machine Translation (MT), there is a long tradition of combining multiple machine translations, as through a Multi-Engine MT (MEMT) architecture; the origins of this are generally credited to Frederking and Nirenburg (1994). $$$$$ The KBMT and EBMT engines also carry a quality score for each output element.

System combination procedures, on the other hand, generate translations from the output of multiple component systems by combining the best fragments of these outputs (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ This reduces the time complexity to 0(n3), and in practice it uses an insignificant part of total processing time.

In NLP, such methods have been applied to tasks such as POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Pedersen, 2000), parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999), and machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ These different splits are then compared with each other and with components from the chart spanning the whole region (if any), and the overall best result is Without dynamic programming, this would have a D 2 combinatorial time complexity.
