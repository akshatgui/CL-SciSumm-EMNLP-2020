The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al (2011), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. $$$$$ The three kinds of edges indicate being published by the same person (solid line), retweeting (dash line), and replying relations (round dotted line) respectively.
The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al (2011), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. $$$$$ By considering the sentiment labels of the related tweets, we can further boost the performance of the sentiment classification, especially for very short and ambiguous tweets.
The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al (2011), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. $$$$$ As illustrated in Figure 1, each circle in the graph indicates a tweet.
The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al (2011), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. $$$$$ For example, for the target iPhone in the tweet “iPhone works better with the CellBand”, we will generate the feature “arg1_v_well”.

For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ In order to generate such features, much NLP work has to be done beforehand, such as tweet normalization, POS tagging, word stemming, and syntactic parsing.
For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ The sentiment about each target in each sentence of the review is determined based on the dominant orientation of the opinion words appearing in the sentence.
For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ It is common that people use definite or demonstrative noun phrases or pronouns referring to the target in a tweet and express sentiments directly on them.
For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ Target-dependent features are binary features, each of which corresponds to the presence of the feature in the tweet.

Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ We would like to thank Matt Callcut for refining the language of this paper, and thank Yuki Arase and the anonymous reviewers for many valuable comments and helpful suggestions.
Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ From Table 3, we can see that the classifier using only the content features achieves the worst accuracy (78.8%).
Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ Twitter sentiment analysis has attracted much attention recently.

These features are all target-independent. SVMdep $$$$$ In this paper, we propose to improve targetdependent sentiment classification of tweets by using both target-dependent and context-aware approaches.
These features are all target-independent. SVMdep $$$$$ We are also interested in exploring relations between Twitter accounts for classifying the sentiments of the tweets published by them.
These features are all target-independent. SVMdep $$$$$ Sentiment analysis on Twitter data has attracted much attention recently.
These features are all target-independent. SVMdep $$$$$ Specifically, the probability of a tweet belonging to a specific sentiment class can be computed with the following formula: Where c is the sentiment label of a tweet which belongs to {positive, negative, neutral}, G is the tweet graph, N(d) is a specific assignment of sentiment labels to all immediate neighbors of the tweet, and r is the content of the tweet.

This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ If we consider that the sentiment of a tweet only depends on its content and immediate neighbors, we can leverage a graph-based method for sentiment classification of tweets.
This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ Specifically, Turney (2002) proposes an unsupervised method for classifying product or movie reviews as positive or negative.
This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ We would like to thank Matt Callcut for refining the language of this paper, and thank Yuki Arase and the anonymous reviewers for many valuable comments and helpful suggestions.

However, labeled data is expensive to create, and examples of Twitter classifiers trained on hand-labeled data are few (Jiang et al 2011). $$$$$ As shown in Table 1, the classifier using only the content features achieves an accuracy of 61.1%.

Subjectivity classification of small units of text, such as individual micro blog posts (Jiang et al, 2011) and sentences (Riloff et al, 2003), has been shown to benefit from additional context. $$$$$ Inspired by (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Pang and Lee, 2004), we design a three-step approach in this paper: In each of the first two steps, a binary SVM classifier is built to perform the classification.
Subjectivity classification of small units of text, such as individual micro blog posts (Jiang et al, 2011) and sentences (Riloff et al, 2003), has been shown to benefit from additional context. $$$$$ According to Table 4, for 66.2% of the tweets concerning the test queries, we can find at least one related tweet.
Subjectivity classification of small units of text, such as individual micro blog posts (Jiang et al, 2011) and sentences (Riloff et al, 2003), has been shown to benefit from additional context. $$$$$ We would also thank Furu Wei and Xiaolong Wang for their help with some of the experiments and the preparation of the camera-ready version of the paper.
