For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ However, because tweets are usually short and more ambiguous, sometimes it is not enough to consider only the current tweet for sentiment classification.
For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ As illustrated in Figure 1, each circle in the graph indicates a tweet.
For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ Specifically, we use two kinds of target-independent features:

Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ For example, in the third example we mentioned above, if we find that the previous and following tweets published by the same person are both positive about the Lakers, we can confidently classify this tweet as positive.
Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ Inspired by (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Pang and Lee, 2004), we design a three-step approach in this paper: In each of the first two steps, a binary SVM classifier is built to perform the classification.

Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ For syntactic parsing we use a Maximum Spanning Tree dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005).

These features are all target-independent. SVMdep: We re-implement the method proposed by Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ Specifically, the probability of a tweet belonging to a specific sentiment class can be computed with the following formula: Where c is the sentiment label of a tweet which belongs to {positive, negative, neutral}, G is the tweet graph, N(d) is a specific assignment of sentiment labels to all immediate neighbors of the tweet, and r is the content of the tweet.

These features are all target-independent. SVMdep: We re-implement the method proposed by Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ As mentioned in Section 1, target-dependent sentiment classification of review sentences is quite different from that of tweets.

This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ Adding mentions co-referring to the target as new extended targets.
This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ In addition, different from previous work using only information on the current tweet for sentiment classification, we propose to take the related tweets of the current tweet into consideration by utilizing graph-based optimization.
This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ Identifying the top K nouns and noun phrases which have the strongest association with the target.

However, labeled data is expensive to create, and examples of Twitter classifiers trained on hand-labeled data are few (Jiang et al 2011). $$$$$ In their approach, a supervised KNN-like classifier is used.
However, labeled data is expensive to create, and examples of Twitter classifiers trained on hand-labeled data are few (Jiang et al 2011). $$$$$ Different from previous work using targetindependent classification, we propose to incorporate syntactic features to distinguish texts used for expressing sentiments towards different targets in a tweet.

Subjectivity classification of small units of text, such as individual micro blog posts (Jiang et al, 2011) and sentences (Riloff et al, 2003), has been shown to benefit from additional context. $$$$$ In our experiments, POS tagging is performed by the OpenNLP POS tagger7.
