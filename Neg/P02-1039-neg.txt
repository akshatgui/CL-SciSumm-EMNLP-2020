Here, we used a model defined by Yamada and Knight (2001) and Yamada and Knight (2002).

The model is further extended to incorporate phrasal translations performed at each node of the input parse tree (Yamada and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ Theoretically we need an LM which gives the prior probability of an English parse tree.
The model is further extended to incorporate phrasal translations performed at each node of the input parse tree (Yamada and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ As the model size becomes huge in a practical setting, and the decoder considers multiple syntactic structures for a word alignment, efficient pruning is necessary.

While (Yamada and Knight, 2002) represent syntactical information in the decoding process through a series of transformation operations, we operate directly at the phrase level. $$$$$ First, the syntax of Chinese is not extremely different from English, compared with other languages such as Japanese or Arabic.

(Yamada and Knight, 2002) propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence. $$$$$ Then, we obtain an English parse tree by removing the leaf nodes (foreign words) from the backreordered tree.
(Yamada and Knight, 2002) propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence. $$$$$ Similarly, rules such as “VP VP X” and “X word” are added for extra word insertion, and they are associated with a probability from the n-table.
(Yamada and Knight, 2002) propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence. $$$$$ When the parsing cost3 comes only from the features within a subtree (TM cost, in our case), the parser will find the optimal tree by keeping the single best subtree for each tuple.

Yamada and Knight (2002) presents a decoder for syntax-based MT that uses so-called phrasal translation units that correspond to blocks. $$$$$ For example, a zero-fertility word in is inserted as IN when “PP IN NP-A” rule is applied.

As an alternative option to our verb-modifier experiments, structured language models (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) might be considered to improve clause coherence, until full-featured syntax-based MT models (Yamada and Knight (2002), Eisner (2003), Chiang (2005) among many others) are tested when translating to morphologically rich languages. $$$$$ As we need to parse sentences on the channel input side only, many X-to-English translation systems can be developed with an English parser alone.

One way to approach reordering is by extending the translation model, either by adding extra models, such as lexicalized (Koehn et al, 2005) or discriminative (Zens and Ney, 2006) reordering models or by directly modelling reordering in hierarchical (Chiang, 2007) or syntactical translation models (Yamada and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ However, some of them, such as the one with (in cantonese), are wrong.
