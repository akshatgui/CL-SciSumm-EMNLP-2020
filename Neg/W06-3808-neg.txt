Some of the work is not related to discourse at all (e.g., lexical similarities (Takamura et al, 2007), morphosyntactic similarities (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) and word-based measures like TF IDF (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006)). $$$$$ In particular, we are interested in the situation where labeled data is scarce.

To perform rating inference on reviews, Goldberg and Zhu (2006) created a graph on both labeled and unlabeled reviews, and then solved an optimization problem to obtain a smooth rating function over the whole graph. $$$$$ This is how unlabeled data can participate in learning.

Our approach accounts for intercategory relationships from the outset of classifier design, rather than addressing this issue with later adjustments. Goldberg and Zhu (2006) proposed a semisupervised learning approach to the rating inference problem in scenarios where labeled training data is scarce. $$$$$ Before moving on to experiments, we note an interesting connection to the supervised learning method in (Pang and Lee, 2005), which formulates rating inference as a metric labeling problem (Kleinberg and Tardos, 2002).

However, similar approaches have been proven rather efficient on other tasks such as document level sentiment classification (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) and word sense disambiguation (Agirre et al, 2006). $$$$$ With the graph defined, there are several algorithms one can use to carry out semi-supervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Delalleau et al., 2005; Joachims, 2003; Blum and Chawla, 2001; Belkin et al., 2005).
