In other words, the coarse outside score computed by the algorithm plays the same role as a heuristic in standard A* parsing (Klein and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ In that model, the score of a lexicalized tree is the product of the scores of two projections of that tree, one onto unlexicalized phrase structure, and one onto phrasalcategory-free word-to-word dependency structure.
