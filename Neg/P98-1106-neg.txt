It is possible to obtain a polynomial parser provided that we limit the number of nodes simultaneously involved in non-projective configurations (see Kahane et al 1998 for similar techniques). $$$$$ When we have reached a final state q of the rule-FSM m, we have recognized a complete subtree rooted in the new governor, 7/.

This formalism is based on previous work presented in (Kahane et al, 1998), which has been substantially reformulated in order to simplify it. $$$$$ This is the reason why C has been added at the end of the lifting condition. of the 1-rules used in the rewriting operation.
This formalism is based on previous work presented in (Kahane et al, 1998), which has been substantially reformulated in order to simplify it. $$$$$ A sentential form contains terminal strings and categories paired with a multiset of lifting conditions, called the lift multiset.

We will extend our basic approach in the spirit of (Kahane et al, 1998) in future work. $$$$$ The 1-rule (1) can be rewrited on the following form: This rule resembles normal dependency rules but instead of introducing syntactic dependents of a category, it introduces a lifted dependent.

We will extend our basic approach in the spirit of (Kahane et al, 1998) in future work. $$$$$ The rewriting operation then must meet the following three conditions: As an example, consider a grammar containing the three dependency rules di (rule 2), d2 (rule 3), and d3 (rule 4), as well as the LP rule pi (rule 5).
We will extend our basic approach in the spirit of (Kahane et al, 1998) in future work. $$$$$ Put differently, in this bottomup view LM represents the set of nodes which have a syntactic governor in the subtree spanning ID, • • w3 and a lifting rule, but are still looking for a linear governor.

Kahane et al (1998) present three different types of rules, for sub categorization, modification, and linear precedence. $$$$$ In addition, we have some lexical mappings (they are obvious from the example), and the start symbol is Vfinite,±.

It is also related to the lifting rules of (Kahane et al, 1998), but where they choose to stipulate rules that license liftings, we opt instead for placing constraints on otherwise unrestricted climbing. $$$$$ If the dot cannot be placed in accordance with the category of ij, then no new entry is made in the parse matrix for n. 2.
It is also related to the lifting rules of (Kahane et al, 1998), but where they choose to stipulate rules that license liftings, we opt instead for placing constraints on otherwise unrestricted climbing. $$$$$ As we traverse the Crule-FSM m, we recognize one by one the linear dependents of a node of category C. Call this governor n. The action of adding a new entry to the parse matrix corresponds to adding a single new linear dependent to n. (While we are working on the C-rule-FSM 771 and are not yet in a final state, we have not yet recognized n itself.)
It is also related to the lifting rules of (Kahane et al, 1998), but where they choose to stipulate rules that license liftings, we opt instead for placing constraints on otherwise unrestricted climbing. $$$$$ The regular expression representing the lifting condition is enriched with a dot separating, on its left, the part of the lifting path which has already been introduced during the rewriting and on its right the part which is still to be introduced for the rewriting to be valid.

The pseudo-projective grammar proposed by Kahane et al (1998) can be parsed in polynomial time and captures non-local dependencies through a form of gap-threading, but the structures generated by the grammar are strictly projective. $$$$$ The entries in the parse matrix M are of the form (in, q), where in is a rule-FSM and q a state of it, except for the entries in squares M(i, i), 1 < j< n, which also contain category labels.

With this conversion technique, output dependency trees are necessarily projective, and extracted dependencies are necessarily local to a phrase, which means that the automatically converted trees can be regarded as pseudo-projective approximations to the correct dependency trees (Kahane et al, 1998). $$$$$ A sample derivation is shown in Figure 4, with the sentential form representation on top and the corresponding tree representation below.

However, predictive grammar-based algorithms such as those of Lombardo and Lesmo (1996) and Kahane et al (1998) have operations which postulate rules and can not be defined in terms of dependency graphs, since they do not do any modifications to the graph. $$$$$ This transition is called the &quot;head transition&quot;.

The definition of non-projectivity can be found in Kahane et al (1998). $$$$$ The parse is complete if there is an entry (m, qm, 0) in square M(n, 1) of the parse matrix, where in is a C-rule-FSM for a start category and qm is a final state of M. If we keep backpointers at each step in the algorithm, we have a compact representation of the parse forest.
The definition of non-projectivity can be found in Kahane et al (1998). $$$$$ Although most linguistic structures can be represented as projective trees, it is well known that projectivity is too strong a constraint for dependency trees, as shown by the example of Figure 2, which includes a non-projective arc (marked with a star).

 $$$$$ In addition, i may have syntactic dependents which are not realized as its own linear dependent and are lifted away.
 $$$$$ Then, we add to M(i, i) every pair (7n, q) such that m is a rule-FSM with a transition labeled C from a start state and q the state reached after that transition.6 Embedded in the usual three loops on i, j, k, we add an entry (mi, q) to M(i, j) if (m1, qi) is in M (k, j), (m2, q2) is in M (i, k+1), q2 is a final state of m2, m2 is a C-rule-FSM, and mi transitions from qi to q on C (a non-head transition).
