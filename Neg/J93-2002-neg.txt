Since Brent (1993) a considerable amount of research focusing on large-scaled automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCF) has met with some success not only in English but also in many other languages. $$$$$ First, forms ending in -s are potentially ambiguous between third person singular present verbs and plural nouns.

We also experimented with a method suggested by Brent (1993) which applies the binomial test on frame frequency data. $$$$$ Let S be some syntactic frame and let H[i] be the number of distinct verbs that were followed by cues for S exactly i times out of N—i.e., the height of the ith histogram bin.

 $$$$$ Unfortunately, this information is not sufficient to parse sentences completely, a fact that is underscored by the current state of the parsing art.
 $$$$$ The most easily formalized and most reliable grammatical facts tend to be those involving auxiliaries, modals, and determiners, the agreement and case properties of pronouns, and so on.
 $$$$$ This paper suggests the following approach: one or a fixed number of examples.
 $$$$$ How can easily recognized, surface grammatical facts be used to extract from a corpus as much syntactic information as possible about individual words?

(Brent 1993) estimated pe according to the acquisition system's performance. $$$$$ Since plural nouns are not necessarily preceded by determiners (I like to take walks), they could pose a significant ambiguity problem.

 $$$$$ The experiments described above used the following 193 verbs, selected at random from the tagged version of the Brown Corpus.
 $$$$$ For example, put requires a location as a second argument, and locations are often represented by PPs headed by locative prepositions.
 $$$$$ Of these 174, there are 87 for which Lerner does not find sufficient evidence to prove that they have any of the six syntactic frames in question.
 $$$$$ There is one approach to the lexical ambiguity problem that does not require giving the learner additional specific knowledge.

 $$$$$ Rather, it seems that significant lexical syntactic information can be recovered using a few approximate cues along with statistical inference based on a simple model of the cues' error distributions.
 $$$$$ It is always possible that it could be an argument of the previous verb want, but Lerner treats that as unlikely.
 $$$$$ Extending Lerner to detect PPs is trivial.
 $$$$$ However, the second stage of verb detection, combined with the statistical criteria, prevent these pairs from introducing errors.

Following studies on automatic SCF extraction (Brent, 1993), we apply a statistical test (Binomial Hypothesis Test) to the unfiltered-Levin-SCF to filter out noisy SCFs, and denote the resulting SCF set as filtered-Levin SCF. $$$$$ It does not matter what these frequencies are as long as they are greater than r_Np.
