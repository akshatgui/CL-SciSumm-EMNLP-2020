Mellish et al (1998) (and subsequently Karamanis and Manurung 2002) advocate genetic algorithms as an alternative to exhaustively searching for the optimal ordering of descriptions of museum artefacts. $$$$$ There seem to be three main approaches to controlling the search for a good RS tree (or something similar).

Following previous work (Mellish et al, 1998) we used a single fitness function that scored candidates based on their coherence. $$$$$ We score as follows: -20 for an unsatisfied precondition for a relation Focus Movement We do not have a complex model of focus development through the text, though development of such a model would be worthwhile.

The genetic algorithms of Mellish et al (1998) and Karamanis and Manarung (2002), as well as the greedy algorithm of Lapata (2003), provide no theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the solutions they propose. $$$$$ For clarity, coreference has been indicated by subscripts.

For example, the measure from (Mellish et al, 1998) looks at the entire discourse up to the current transition for some of their cost factors. $$$$$ If there is only one way smoothly to include a fact in the text, the chance of finding it by random subtree swapping is very low.
For example, the measure from (Mellish et al, 1998) looks at the entire discourse up to the current transition for some of their cost factors. $$$$$ We score as follows: -4 for each fact that will come textually between a satellite and its nucleus Constraints on Information Ordering Our relations have preconditions which are facts that should be conveyed before them.
For example, the measure from (Mellish et al, 1998) looks at the entire discourse up to the current transition for some of their cost factors. $$$$$ The approach is controversial in that it takes into account realisation order in the criterion for a legal tree.

Mellish et al (1998) made the point that even this restricted approach would soon become intractable with more than a small set of facts when one allows weak RST relations such as Joint and Elaboration into the model. $$$$$ That is, such an algorithm can be stopped at any point and it will be able to yield at that point a result which is the best it has found so far.
