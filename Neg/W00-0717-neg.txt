It has often been proposed that children might make use of information about the contextual distribution of usage of words to induce the parts-of-speech of their native language (e.g. Maratsos and Chalkley, 1980), and work by, e.g., Redington, Chater and Finch (1998) and Clark (2000), showed that parts-of-speech can indeed be induced by clustering together words that are used in similar contexts in a corpus. $$$$$ This paper addresses the issue of the automatic induction of syntactic categories from unannotated corpora.

 $$$$$ Previous techniques give good results, but fail to cope well with ambiguity or rare words.
 $$$$$ Both of these problems can be overcome in the normal way by using clusters: approximate the context distribution as being a probability distribution over ordered pairs of clusters multiplied by the conditional distributions of the words given the clusters : I use an iterative algorithm, starting with a trivial clustering, with each of the K clusters filled with the kth most frequent word in the corpus.

We found that Brown et al's (1992) older information-theoretic approach, which does not explicitly address the problems of rare and ambiguous words (Clark, 2000) and was designed to induce large numbers of plausible syntactic and semantic clusters, can perform just as well. $$$$$ For sufficiently frequent words this method produces satisfactory results.

 $$$$$ Unfortunately it is not possible to cluster based directly on the context distributions for two reasons: first the data is too sparse to estimate the context distributions adequately for any but the most frequent words, and secondly some words which intuitively are very similar (Schi_itze's example is 'a' and 'an') have radically different context distributions.
