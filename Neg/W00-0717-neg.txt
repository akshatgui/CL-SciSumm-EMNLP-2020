It has often been proposed that children might make use of information about the contextual distribution of usage of words to induce the parts-of-speech of their native language (e.g. Maratsos and Chalkley, 1980), and work by, e.g., Redington, Chater and Finch (1998) and Clark (2000), showed that parts-of-speech can indeed be induced by clustering together words that are used in similar contexts in a corpus. $$$$$ Note that with rare words, the KL divergence reduces to the log likelihood of the word's context distribution plus a constant factor.

Our work builds on two older part-of-speech inducers word clustering algorithms of Clark (2000) and Brown et al (1992) that were recently shown to be more robust than other well-known fully unsupervised techniques (Christodoulopoulos et al, 2010). $$$$$ In this case, under the assumption that the word is unambiguous, which is only valid for comparatively rare words, we can use Bayes's rule to calculate the posterior probability that it is in each class, using as a prior probability the distribution of rare words in each class.
