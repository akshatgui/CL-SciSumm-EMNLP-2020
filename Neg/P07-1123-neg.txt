In addition to the above methods for using English resources, the lexicon-based method investigated in Mihalcea et al (2007) can also use English resources by directly projecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons. $$$$$ While work on subjectivity analysis in other languages is growing (e.g., Japanese data are used in (Takamura et al., 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al., 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006)), much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data.

In addition to the above methods for using English resources, the lexicon-based method investigated in Mihalcea et al (2007) can also use English resources by directly projecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons. $$$$$ In this paper, we investigate methods to automatically generate resources for subjectivity analysis for a new target language by leveraging on the resources and tools available for English, which in many cases took years of work to complete.
In addition to the above methods for using English resources, the lexicon-based method investigated in Mihalcea et al (2007) can also use English resources by directly projecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons. $$$$$ For instance, the opinion tracking system Lydia (Lloyd et al., 2005) gives separate ratings for subjectivity and sentiment.

 $$$$$ For instance, the opinion tracking system Lydia (Lloyd et al., 2005) gives separate ratings for subjectivity and sentiment.
 $$$$$ In fact, the problem of distinguishing subjective versus objective instances has often proved to be more difficult than subsequent polarity classification, so improvements in subjectivity classification promise to positively impact sentiment classification.

Mihalcea et al (2007) propose two methods for translating sentiment lexicons. $$$$$ However, there are cases where the differences are due to the subjectivity being lost in the translation.

Mihalcea et al (2007) propose two methods for translating sentiment lexicons. $$$$$ Automatic subjectivity analysis methods have been used in a wide variety of text processing applications, such as tracking sentiment timelines in online forums and news (Lloyd et al., 2005; Balog et al., 2006), review classification (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).

There is a growing number of methods that use data available in one language to build text processing tools for another language, for diverse tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Ng et al, 2003), syntactic parsing (Hwa et al, 2005), information retrieval (Monz and Dorr, 2005), subjectivity analysis (Mihalcea et al, 2007), and others. $$$$$ Many subjectivity and sentiment analysis tools rely on manually or semi-automatically constructed lexicons (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2006).

For subjectivity lexicons translation, Mihalcea et al (2007) and Wan (2008) used the first sense in a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ After removing the 504 test sentences, we are left with 10,628 sentences that are automatically annotated for subjectivity.
