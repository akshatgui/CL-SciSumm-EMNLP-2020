POS tagger in this work, we note that taggers optimized specifically for social media are now available and would likely have resulted in higher tagging accuracy (e.g. Owoputi et al (2013)). $$$$$ During training, the MEMM log-likelihood for a tagged tweet (x, y) is the sum over the observed token tags yt, each conditional on the tweet being tagged and the observed previous tag (with a start symbol before the first token in x), We optimize the parameters 3 with OWL-QN, an L1-capable variant of L-BFGS (Andrew and Gao, 2007; Liu and Nocedal, 1989) to minimize the regularized objective where N is the number of tokens in the corpus and the sum ranges over all tagged tweets (x, y) in the training data.

To test this, we train a CRF model (Lafferty et al, 2001) with simple orthographic features and word clusters (Owoputi et al, 2013) on the annotated Twitter data described in Gimpel et al (2011). $$$$$ Our POS tagger can make use of any number of possibly overlapping features.
To test this, we train a CRF model (Lafferty et al, 2001) with simple orthographic features and word clusters (Owoputi et al, 2013) on the annotated Twitter data described in Gimpel et al (2011). $$$$$ We observe many variants of categories traditionally considered closed-class, including pronouns (B: u = “you”) and prepositions (C: fir = “for”).

For NER, we use standard features, including POS tags (from the previous experiments), indicators for hyphens, digits, single quotes, upper/lowercase, 3-character prefix and suffix information, and Brown word cluster features 6 with 2,4,8,16 bit string prefixes estimated from a large Twitter corpus (Owoputi et al, 2013). $$$$$ Several Unicode character ranges are reserved for emoji-style symbols (including the three Unicode hearts in G4); however, depending on the user’s software, characters in these ranges might be rendered differently or not at all.

We use the CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger (Owoputi et al, 2013) to select only instances in the verb sense. $$$$$ One strategy would be to analyze these forms into a PTB-style tokenization, as discussed in Forsyth (2007), who proposes to analyze doncha as do/VBP ncha/PRP, but notes it would be difficult.

We use the CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger (Owoputi et al, 2013) to select only instances in the verb sense. $$$$$ We retrained and evaluated their tagger (version 0.2) on our corrected dataset. tures, affix n-grams, capitalization, emoticon patterns, etc.—and the accuracy is in fact still better than the previous work (row 4).18 We also wanted to know whether to keep the tag dictionary and name list features, but the splits reported in Fig.

Part-of-speech tags are assigned based on Owoputi et al's tweet POS system (Owoputi et al, 2013). $$$$$ If we drop the clusters and rely only on tag dictionaries and namelists, accuracy decreases significantly (row 3).
Part-of-speech tags are assigned based on Owoputi et al's tweet POS system (Owoputi et al, 2013). $$$$$ The annotators also consulted the POS annotations in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) as an additional reference.
Part-of-speech tags are assigned based on Owoputi et al's tweet POS system (Owoputi et al, 2013). $$$$$ Before computing this, we lowercased the text to match the clusters and removed tokens tagged as URLs and at-mentions.
