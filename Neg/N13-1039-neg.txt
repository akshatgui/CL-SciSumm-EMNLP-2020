To test this, we train a CRF model (Lafferty et al, 2001) with simple orthographic features and word clusters (Owoputi et al, 2013) on the annotated Twitter data described in Gimpel et al (2011). $$$$$ Qualitative analysis of these word clusters yields insights about NLP and linguistic phenomena in this genre.

For NER, we use standard features, including POS tags (from the previous experiments), indicators for hyphens, digits, single quotes, upper/lowercase, 3-character prefix and suffix information, and Brown word cluster features 6 with 2,4,8,16 bit string prefixes estimated from a large Twitter corpus (Owoputi et al, 2013). $$$$$ We also annotated a new dataset of tweets with POS tags, improved the annotations in the previous dataset from Gimpel et al., and developed annotation guidelines for manual POS tagging of tweets.

We use the CMU Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger (Owoputi et al, 2013) to select only instances in the verb sense. $$$$$ Thus the Twitter word clusters are also useful for language in the medium of text chat rooms; we suspect these clusters will be applicable for deeper syntactic and semantic analysis in other online conversational text mediums, such as text messages and instant messages.

Part-of-speech tags are assigned based on Owoputi et al's tweet POS system (Owoputi et al, 2013). $$$$$ The total number of features is 3.7 million, all of which are used under pure L2 regularization; but only 60,000 are selected by elastic net regularization with (A1, A2) = (0.25, 2), which achieves nearly the same (but no better) accuracy as pure L2,16 and we use it for all experiments.
