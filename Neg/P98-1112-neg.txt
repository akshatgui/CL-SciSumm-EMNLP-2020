Levin-inspired classes have been used in several NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation (Dorr, 1997) and Document Classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998). $$$$$ An electronic lexical database and some of its applications.

Levin-inspired classes have been used in several NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation (Dorr, 1997) and Document Classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998). $$$$$ If we exclude all support type verbs, 70% of the verbs yield information in answering the question &quot;what happened?&quot; or &quot;what did X do?&quot;

The problems of non-nominal terms (Klavans and Kan, 1998), term variation (Jacquemin et al, 1997), and relevant contexts (Maynard and Ananiadou, 1998), can be considered for improving the performance. $$$$$ Identification of such sequences will enable us to assign functions to particular sections of contiguous text in an article, in much the same way that text segmentation program seeks identify topics from distributional vocabulary (Hearst, 1994; Kan et al., 1998).
The problems of non-nominal terms (Klavans and Kan, 1998), term variation (Jacquemin et al, 1997), and relevant contexts (Maynard and Ananiadou, 1998), can be considered for improving the performance. $$$$$ The range of correlation is from .850 between the communication verb synset (give, get, inform, ...) and the act verb synset (have, relate, give, ...) to .238 between the think verb synset (plan, study, give, ...) and the change state verb synset (fall, come, close, ..) These correlations show that frequent synsets do not behave independently of each other and thus confirm that the WordNet results are not an effective way to achieve document discrimination.

Verb classifications have, in fact, been used to support many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as language generation, machine translation (Dorr, 1997), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996) and sub categorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002). $$$$$ In journalistic prose, as seen by the statistics in Table 1, at least 20% of the sentences contain communication verbs such as say and announce; these sentences report point of view or indicate an attributed comment.

Knowledge about verb classes is crucial for lexical acquisition in support of language generation and machine translation (Dolt, 1997) and document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), yet manual classification of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task (Levm, 1993 Miller et al , 1990, Dang et al, 1998). $$$$$ To illustrate, consider a sample article from WSJ of average length (12 sentences in length) with a high percentage of communication verbs.

Out of the large syntactic constituents of a sentence, e.g. noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases, we assume that noun phrases (NPs) carry the most contentful information about the document, even if sometimes the verbs are important too, as reported in the work by [Klavans and Kan (1998)]. $$$$$ In contrast, the named entity task, which identifies nouns and noun phrases, has generated numerous projects as evidenced by a host of papers in recent conferences, (e.g.

In document classification, Klavans and Kan (1998) demonstrate that document type is correlated with the presence of many verbs of a certain EVCA class (Levin 1993). $$$$$ Although the results reported in this paper permitted the validation of our hypothesis, unless a fair comparison between resources is performed, conclusions about WordNet as a resource versus EVCA class distinctions should not be inferred.
