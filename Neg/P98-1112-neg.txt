Verbs are very important sources of knowledge in many language engineering tasks, and the relationships among verbs appear to play a major role in the organization and use of this knowledge: Knowledge about verb classes is crucial for lexical acquisition in support of language generation and machine translation (Dorr, 1997), and document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998). $$$$$ We have applied the algorithm to WSJ data and have discriminated articles with five EVCA semantic classes into categories such as features, opinions, and announcements.

Levin-inspired classes have been used in several NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation (Dorr, 1997) and Document Classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998). $$$$$ In the WSJ corpus, the two most common main verbs are say, a communication verb, and be, a support verb.
Levin-inspired classes have been used in several NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation (Dorr, 1997) and Document Classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998). $$$$$ Correlations for EVCA classes are shown in Table 6.

The problems of non-nominal terms (Klavans and Kan, 1998), term variation (Jacquemin et al, 1997), and relevant contexts (Maynard and Ananiadou, 1998), can be considered for improving the performance. $$$$$ Less progress has been made on ways to utilize verbal information efficiently.

Verb classifications have, in fact, been used to support many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as language generation, machine translation (Dorr, 1997), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996) and sub categorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002). $$$$$ representations of context for the detection and corof malapropisms.

Knowledge about verb classes is crucial for lexical acquisition in support of language generation and machine translation (Dolt, 1997) and document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), yet manual classification of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task (Levm, 1993 Miller et al , 1990, Dang et al, 1998). $$$$$ In addition to say, other high frequency communication verbs include report, announce, and state.

Out of the large syntactic constituents of a sentence, e.g. noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases, we assume that noun phrases (NPs) carry the most contentful information about the document, even if sometimes the verbs are important too, as reported in the work by [Klavans and Kan (1998)]. $$$$$ However, without associated nominal arguments, it is impossible to know whether the [THING] that drops refers to airfare prices or projected earnings.
