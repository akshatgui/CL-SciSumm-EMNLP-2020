Concerning techniques for improving out-of domain parsing, a related approach has been to use self-training with auto-parsed out-of-domain data, as McClosky and Charniak (2008) do for English constituency parsing, though in that approach lexical generalization is not explicitly performed. $$$$$ This second point is emphasized by the second paper on self-training for adaptation (McClosky et al., 2006b).
Concerning techniques for improving out-of domain parsing, a related approach has been to use self-training with auto-parsed out-of-domain data, as McClosky and Charniak (2008) do for English constituency parsing, though in that approach lexical generalization is not explicitly performed. $$$$$ Thus one might expect that the English of a Biology textbook would be intermediate between the more typical English of a news article and the specialized English native to the domain.

Parse trees come from the Charniak-Johnson parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with a self-trained biomedical parsing model (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), and are converted to dependency structures again using Stanford CoreNLP. $$$$$ It self-trained on NANC, not Brown.

The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ On the other hand, it is already better than the 80.2% best previous result for biomedical data.
The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ As already noted, the Medline abstracts used for self-training were chosen randomly and thus span a large number of biomedical sub-domains.
The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ We self-trained the standard C/J parser on 270,000 sentences of Medline abstracts.
The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ It is reasonable to assume that its use would result in further improvement.

The re-ranking parser of Charniak & Johnson adapted to the biomedical domain (McClosky and Charniak, 2008). $$$$$ However more recent results have shown that it can indeed improve parser performance (Bacchiani et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006a; McClosky et al., 2006b).
The re-ranking parser of Charniak & Johnson adapted to the biomedical domain (McClosky and Charniak, 2008). $$$$$ However, since the newer parsers do not perform quite as well as the C/J parser on WSJ data, it is probably the case that they would not significantly alter the landscape.

For syntactic parsing, we use the output of the BLLIP re-ranking parser adapted to the biomedical domain by McClosky and Charniak (2008), as provided by the shared task organizers in the Stanford collapsed dependency format with conjunct dependency propagation. $$$$$ Furthermore, the resulting parser is of interest in its own right, being as it is the most accurate biomedical parser yet developed.
For syntactic parsing, we use the output of the BLLIP re-ranking parser adapted to the biomedical domain by McClosky and Charniak (2008), as provided by the shared task organizers in the Stanford collapsed dependency format with conjunct dependency propagation. $$$$$ This an of 84.3% on a standard test set of biomedical abstracts from the Genia corpus.

Parsing is performed using the Charniak-Johnson parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with the self-trained biomedical parsing model of McClosky and Charniak (2008). $$$$$ As is well known, biomedical data is hard on parsers because it is so far from more “standard” English.
Parsing is performed using the Charniak-Johnson parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with the self-trained biomedical parsing model of McClosky and Charniak (2008). $$$$$ At 81.4% it gives us a one percent improvement over the original WSJ parser.

Parsing is performed using the Charniak-Johnson parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with the self-trained biomedical parsing model of McClosky and Charniak (2008). $$$$$ So, for example, McClosky et al. (2006a) found that the data from the handannotated WSJ data should be considered at least five times more important than NANC data on an event by event level.
