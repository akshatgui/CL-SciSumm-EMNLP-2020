Concerning techniques for improving out-of domain parsing, a related approach has been to use self-training with auto-parsed out-of-domain data, as McClosky and Charniak (2008) do for English constituency parsing, though in that approach lexical generalization is not explicitly performed. $$$$$ Furthermore, the resulting parser is of interest in its own right, being as it is the most accurate biomedical parser yet developed.

Parse trees come from the Charniak-Johnson parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with a self-trained biomedical parsing model (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), and are converted to dependency structures again using Stanford CoreNLP. $$$$$ By doing so we achieved a 20% error reduction over the best previous result for biomedical parsing.

The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ Their best result was an f-score of 80.2%.

The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ Here we show the f-score for four versions of the parser as a function of number of self-training sentences.

The re-ranking parser of Charniak & Johnson adapted to the biomedical domain (McClosky and Charniak, 2008). $$$$$ In particular we self-train the standard Charniak/Johnson Penn-Treebank (C/J) parser using unannotated biomedical data.
The re-ranking parser of Charniak & Johnson adapted to the biomedical domain (McClosky and Charniak, 2008). $$$$$ While they show some improvement (from 75.7% to 80.5% f-score) there are several aspects of this work which leave its results less than convincing as to the utility of selftraining for adaptation.

For syntactic parsing, we use the output of the BLLIP re-ranking parser adapted to the biomedical domain by McClosky and Charniak (2008), as provided by the shared task organizers in the Stanford collapsed dependency format with conjunct dependency propagation. $$$$$ Two previous papers would seem to address this issue: the work by Bacchiani et al. (2006) and McClosky et al.

Parsing is performed using the Charniak-Johnson parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with the self-trained biomedical parsing model of McClosky and Charniak (2008). $$$$$ This parser is available on the web.4 Finally, there is no reason to believe that 84.3% is an upper bound on what can be achieved with current techniques.
