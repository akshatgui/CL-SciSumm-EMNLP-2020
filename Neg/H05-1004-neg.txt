For this reason, we compute an unweighted entity-constrained mention F-measure (Luo, 2005) and report all contrastive experiments with this metric. $$$$$ The metric is com puted by aligning reference and system entities (or coreference chains) with the constraint that a system (reference) entity is aligned with at most one reference (system) entity.

But the metric has a systematic bias for systems generating fewer entities (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) - see Luo (2005). $$$$$ The paper proposes a Constrained Entity Alignment F-Measure (CEAF) for evaluatingcoreference resolution.

Following the timely emphasis on end-to-end evaluation, the official track used predicted mentions and measured performance using five coreference measures: MUC (Vilain et al, 1995), B 3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), CEAF e (Luo, 2005), CEAF m (Luo, 2005), and BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, 2011). $$$$$ and ?president-elect?

However, it turns out that the CEAF metric (Luo, 2005) was always intended to work seamlessly on predicted mentions, and so has been the case with the B 3 metric. $$$$$ Comparative experiments are conducted to show that the widely known MUC F-measure has serious flaws in evaluating a coreference system.
However, it turns out that the CEAF metric (Luo, 2005) was always intended to work seamlessly on predicted mentions, and so has been the case with the B 3 metric. $$$$$ We show that the best alignment is a maximum bipartite matching problem which can be solved by theKuhn-Munkres algorithm.
