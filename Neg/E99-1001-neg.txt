It has been shown in (Mikheev et al, 1999) that a NE Recognition system performs reasonably well for most classes even without gazetteers. $$$$$ It is encouraging to note that Krupka and Hausman (1998) point out that the muc-7 articles which we used in our experiments have less external evidence than do Wall Street Journal articles, which suggests that on Wall Street Journal articles our system might perform even better than on muc-7 articles.

It is common practice in NER to utilize the discourse level to disambiguate items in non predictive contexts (see e.g. Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ Figure 4 summarises the Precision and Recall results for each of these modes and confirms the hypotheses.

It is common practice in NER to utilize the discourse level to disambiguate items in non predictive contexts (see e.g. Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ The rules as well as the maximum entropy models make use of internal and external evidence in that type of text when trying to identify named entities, and it is obvious that this system cannot be applied without modification to a different type of text, e.g. scientific articles.
It is common practice in NER to utilize the discourse level to disambiguate items in non predictive contexts (see e.g. Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ However, our experiments only show the usefulness of gazetteers on a particular type of text, viz. journalistic English with mixed case.

To date, Named Entity Recognition (NER) has only used gazetteers as evidence that a text span could be some kind of place name (LOCATION), even though their finite nature makes lists of names of limited use for classification (Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ And simple techniques for extending the gazetteers on the basis of a sample of just 30 articles already makes the system competitive again.

Other work has supported the use of gazetteers in general but has found that lists of only moderate size are sufficient to provide most of the benefit (Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ We conclude with observations about the domain independence of the competition and of our experiments.

The internal and external evidence is being used by all NERC systems such as LTG (Mikheev et al 1999), FASTUS (Hobbs et al 1997), Proteus (Yangarber, Grishman, 1998). $$$$$ The basic gazetteers in the Isoquest system for muc-7 contain 110,000 names, but Krupka and Hausman (1998) show that system performance does not degrade much when the Proceedings of EACL '99 gazetteers are reduced to 25,000 and 9,000 names; conversely, they also show that the addition of an extra 42 entries to the gazetteers improves performance dramatically.

In such cases all tokens forming an NE and all their combinations are stored in the dynamic lexicon (Mikheev et al 1999:5). $$$$$ In the sentence &quot;Unfortunately, Daily and Partners lost their court case&quot; the name of the company does not include the word &quot;unfortunately&quot;, but it still includes the word &quot;Daily&quot;, which is just as common a word as &quot;unfortunately&quot;.
In such cases all tokens forming an NE and all their combinations are stored in the dynamic lexicon (Mikheev et al 1999:5). $$$$$ This raises several questions: how important are gazetteers? is it important that they are big? if gazetteers are important but their size isn't, then what are the criteria for building gazetteers?

Since many tagging systems utilise gazetteers of known entities, some research has focused on their automatic extraction from the web (Etzioni et al, 2005) or Wikipedia (Toral et al, 2008), although Mikheev et al (1999) and others have shown that larger NE lists do not necessarily correspond to increased NER performance. $$$$$ This system will have tagged correctly all 20 locations, since it tagged everything as LOCATION; its recall score is 20/20, or 100%.

 $$$$$ Only in step 3 is information from the gazetteers used without context-checking.
 $$$$$ Subsequent phases of processing add gradually more and more named entities (recall increases from around 40% to around 90%), but on occasion introduce errors (resulting in a slight drop in precision).
 $$$$$ For example, in a reference to &quot;a Hamburg hospital&quot;, &quot;Hamburg&quot; no longer gets marked up as a location, because the word occurs nowhere else in the text, and that context is not sufficient to assume it indicates a location (cf. a Community Hospital, a Catholic Hospital, an NHS Hospital, a Trust-Controlled Hospital, etc).
