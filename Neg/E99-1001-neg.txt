 $$$$$ It is often claimed that Named Entity recognition systems need extensive gazetteers—lists of names of people, organisations, locations, and other named entities.

It has been shown in (Mikheev et al, 1999) that a NE Recognition system performs reasonably well for most classes even without gazetteers. $$$$$ Without further formal evaluations with externally supplied evaluation corpora it is difficult to judge how general this text type is.

It is common practice in NER to utilize the discourse level to disambiguate items in non predictive contexts (see e.g. Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ However, our experiments only show the usefulness of gazetteers on a particular type of text, viz. journalistic English with mixed case.

Since many tagging systems utilise gazetteers of known entities, some research has focused on their automatic extraction from the web (Etzioni et al, 2005) or Wikipedia (Toral et al, 2008), although Mikheev et al (1999) and others have shown that larger NE lists do not necessarily correspond to increased NER performance. $$$$$ The results so far suggest that the most useful gazetteers are those that contain very common names, names which the authors can expect their audience already to know about, rather than far-fetched examples of little known places or organisations.
