Similar observations are made by Harabagiu et al (2001), who point out that intelligent selection of positive instances can potentially minimize the amount of knowledge required to perform coreference resolution accurately. $$$$$ Table 4 lists the results.

To expand our set of candidate partitions, we can potentially incorporate more high-performing coreference systems into our framework, which is flexible enough to accommodate even those that adopt knowledge-based (e.g., Harabagiu et al (2001)) and unsupervised approaches (e.g., Cardie and Wagstaff (1999), Bean and Riloff (2004)). $$$$$ To this end we (1) analyze the data to find what types of anaphor-antecedent pairs are most popular in real-world texts; (2) devise knowledge-minimalist rules for handling the majority of those popular cases; and (3) discover what supplementary knowledge is needed for remaining, more difficult cases.

These measures are not specifically developed for coreference resolution but simply taken off-the-shelf and applied to our task without any specific tuning i.e. in contrast to Harabagiu et al. (2001), who weight WordNet relations differently in order to compute the confidence measure of the path. $$$$$ Table 4 shows that the seed set of rules had good precision but poor recall.

For example, motivated by the fact that some coreference relations are harder to identify than the others (see Harabagiu et al (2001)), Ng and Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model. $$$$$ For example, if NPi is &quot;the professor's son&quot; and NP2 is &quot;his father&quot;, the semantic consistency between father and professor is more likely, given that his and son corefer.
