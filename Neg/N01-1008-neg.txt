Mining semantic information from WordNet We used the WordNet knowledge base to mine patterns of WordNet paths that connect pairs of coreferring nouns from the annotated chains.

Similar observations are made by Harabagiu et al (2001), who point out that intelligent selection of positive instances can potentially minimize the amount of knowledge required to perform coreference resolution accurately. $$$$$ Table 4 shows that the seed set of rules had good precision but poor recall.

To expand our set of candidate partitions, we can potentially incorporate more high-performing coreference systems into our framework, which is flexible enough to accommodate even those that adopt knowledge-based (e.g., Harabagiu et al (2001)) and unsupervised approaches (e.g., Cardie and Wagstaff (1999), Bean and Riloff (2004)). $$$$$ computed the the Fperformance measures have been obtained automatically using the MUC-6 coreference scoring program (Vilain et al. 1995).

Vieira & Poesio (2000), Harabagiu et al (2001), and Markert & Nissim (2005) explore the use of WordNet for different coreference resolution subtasks, such as resolving bridging reference, other and definite NP anaphora, and MUC-style coreference resolution. $$$$$ In the future we intend to compare the overall effect of rules that recognize referential expressions on the overall performance of the system.

These measures are not specifically developed for coreference resolution but simply taken off-the-shelf and applied to our task without any specific tuning i.e. in contrast to Harabagiu et al.

Harabagiu et al (2001) use paths through Wordnet, using not only synonym and is-a relations, but also parts, morphological derivations, gloss texts and polysemy, which are weighted with a measure based on the relation types and number of path elements. $$$$$ Furthermore, by using an entropy-based method we determine the best partition of corefering expressions in coreference chains.

For example, motivated by the fact that some coreference relations are harder to identify than the others (see Harabagiu et al (2001)), Ng and Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model. $$$$$ Otherwise, fi is set to 0.
