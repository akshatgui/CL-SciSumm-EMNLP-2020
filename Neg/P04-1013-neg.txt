For example, see (Henderson, 2004) for a discussion of why generative models are better than models parameterized to estimate the a posteriori probability directly. $$$$$ What is important is that this estimate minimizes the effect of the pruned parses’ probabilities on the part of the training process which occurs after the probabilities of the best parses have been calculated.
For example, see (Henderson, 2004) for a discussion of why generative models are better than models parameterized to estimate the a posteriori probability directly. $$$$$ Collins (2000) and Collins and Duffy (2002) also succeed in finding algorithms for training discriminative models which balance tractability with effectiveness, showing improvements over a generative model.

There certainly exist competitive parsers that internally represent lexical items as real-valued vectors, such as the neural network-based parser of Henderson (2004), and even parsers which use pre-trained word embeddings to represent the lexicon, such as Socher et al. $$$$$ We take the approach of actually calculating an estimate of the conditional probability because it differs minimally from the generative probability model.

First, these parsers are among the best in the literature, with a test performance of 90.7 F1 for the baseline Berkeley parser on the Wall Street Journal corpus (compared to 90.4 for Socher et al (2013) and 90.1 for Henderson (2004)). $$$$$ Thus it is relatively easy to determine the significance of each word.

Even though some parsers effectively exhibit linear behavior in sentence length (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), fast statistical parsers such as (Henderson, 2004) still take around 1.5 seconds for sentences of length 35 in tests that we made. $$$$$ The parser which uses this approach outperforms both a generative model and a discriminative model, achieving state-of-the-art levels of performance (90.1% F-measure on constituents).

Other techniques are also possible; Henderson (2004) uses neural networks to induce latent left-corner parser states. $$$$$ For the parsers with generative probability models, maximum accuracy is achieved with a post-word beam width of 100.

 $$$$$ In order to apply standard probability estimation methods, we use neural networks to induce finite representations of both these sequences, which we will denote h(d1,..., di−1) and l(yield(di,..., dm)), respectively.
 $$$$$ For the networks trained with the discriminative optimization criteria and the generative probability model, we trained networks for the 508 (“DGSSN-Freq>200”) and 4215 (“DGSSNFreq>20”) word vocabularies.
 $$$$$ The need to calculate word predictions makes training times for the 11,993 word vocabulary very long, and as of this writing no such network training has been completed.
 $$$$$ We find that the discriminative probability model is much worse than the generative one, but that training to optimize the discriminative criteria results in improved performance.

 $$$$$ This probability is only nonzero if yield(d1,..., dm) = w1,..., wn, so we can restrict attention to only those parses which actually yield the given sentence.

 $$$$$ Our best performing model is more accurate than all these previous models except (Bod, 2003).

Stochastic optimization methods have proven to be extremely efficient for the training of models involving computationally expensive objective functions like those encountered with our task (Vishwanathan et al, 2006) and, in fact, the on-line backpropagation learning used in the neural network parser of Henderson (2004) is a form of stochastic gradient descent. $$$$$ Performance of the latter model on the standard test set achieves 90.1% F-measure on constituents, which is the second best current accuracy level, and only 0.6% below the current best (Bod, 2003).

In particular, the neural network constituent parsers in (Henderson, 2003) and (Henderson, 2004) can be regarded as coarse approximations to their corresponding ISBN model. $$$$$ By inducing the history representations specifically to fit the chosen model and training criteria, we avoid having to choose independence assumptions which might bias our results.

 $$$$$ Both the parse history d1,..., di−1 and the lookahead string yield(di,..., dm) grow with the length of the sentence.
 $$$$$ Note that d1,..., di−1 specifies yield(d1,..., di−1), so it is sufficient to only add yield(di,..., dm) to the conditional in order for the entire input sentence to be included in the conditional.
