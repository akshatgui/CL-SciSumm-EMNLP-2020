Sudo et al (2003) acquired subtrees derived from dependency trees as extraction rules for IE in general domains. $$$$$ Without generalizing case marking for nominalized predicates, the Predicate-Argument model excludes some highly contributing patterns with nominalized predicates, as some example patterns show in Figure 4.

 $$$$$ In particular, we would like to relax the restraint that all the fills must be tagged with their proper NE tags by introducing a GENERIC place-holder into the extraction patterns.
 $$$$$ The association of NE classes and slots in the template is made automatically; Person, Organization, Post (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, CORG, C-POST (NE-classes), respectively, in the Succession scenario, and Suspect, Arresting Agency, Charge (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, C-ORG, C-OFFENCE (NE-classes), respectively, in the Arrest scenario.
 $$$$$ For efficiency and to eliminate low-frequency noise, we filtered out the pattern candidates that appear in less than 3 documents throughout the entire collection.
 $$$$$ Even after SUBT hit the drop at 56%, SUBT is consistently a few percent higher in precision than Chain patterns for most recall levels.

The idea of a self-customizing IE system emerged recently with the improvement of pattern acquisition techniques (Sudo et al, 2003b), where the IE system customizes itself across domains given by the user's query. $$$$$ (See Table 1 for detail.)

Following (Sudo et al, 2003) we are interested only in the lexemes which are near neighbors of the most frequent verbs. $$$$$ The unsupervised text classification task is to measure how close a pattern matching system, given a set of extraction patterns, simulates the document retrieval of the same IR system as in the previous sub-section.

Following (Sudo et al, 2003) we are interested only in the lexemes which are near neighbors of the most frequent verbs. $$$$$ As we pointed out in Section 2, we need to pay special attention to overlapping patterns; the more relevant context a pattern contains, the higher it should be ranked.

In addition, Sudo et al (2003) proposed representations for IE patterns which extends the SVO representation used here and, while they did not appear to significantly improve IE, it is expected that it will be straightforward to extend the vector space model to those pattern representations. $$$$$ In general, a predicate provides a strong context for its arguments, which leads to good accuracy.

For example, Yangarber (2003) uses just subject-verb-object tuples while Sudo et al (2003) allow any subpart of the tree to act as an extraction pattern. $$$$$ The detailed analysis of the experiment revealed that the overly-general patterns are more severely penalized in the Subtree model compared to the Chain model.

 $$$$$ However, some Predicate-Argument patterns may be too general, so that they could be applied to texts about a different scenario and mistakenly detect entities from them.
 $$$$$ Figure 12 shows an example of an extraction task in the terrorism domain where the event template consists of perpetrator, date, location and victim.
 $$$$$ Although both models penalize general patterns in the same way, the Subtree model also promotes more scenario-specific patterns than the Chain model.

Subtrees: The final model to be considered is the subtree model (Sudo et al, 2003). $$$$$ However, this flexibility can also be a disadvantage, since it means that a very large number of pattern candidates — all possible subtrees of the dependency tree of each sentence in the corpus — must be considered.

 $$$$$ The detailed analysis of the experiment revealed that the overly-general patterns are more severely penalized in the Subtree model compared to the Chain model.
 $$$$$ The main cause of difficulty in finding entities by extraction patterns is the fact that the participating entities can appear not only as an argument of the predicate that describes the event type, but also in other places within the sentence or in the prior text.
 $$$$$ Each approach is based on a particular model for the patterns to be acquired, such as a predicate-argument structure or a dependency chain.
 $$$$$ Thus, it efficiently avoids the construction of duplicate patterns and runs almost linearly in the total size of the maximal tree patterns contained in the corpus.

For example, Sudo et al (2003) used patterns consisting of a path from a verb to any of its descendents (direct or indirect) while Bunescuand Mooney (2005) suggest the shortest path between the items being related. $$$$$ The following ranking function was used to rank each pattern candidate.

An additional advantage of linked chain patterns is that they do not cause an unwieldy number of candidate patterns to be generated unlike some other approaches for representing extraction patterns, such as the one proposed by Sudo et al (2003) where any subtree of the dependency tree can act as a potential pattern. $$$$$ The experiment of this study is focused on comparing the performance of the earlier extraction pattern models to the proposed Subtree Model (SUBT).

Given a dependency parse tree, any sub-tree can be a candidate template, setting some of its nodes as variables (Sudo et al, 2003). $$$$$ By allowing a GENERIC place-holder to match with anything as long as the context of the pattern is matched, the extraction patterns can extract the entities that are not tagged properly.
