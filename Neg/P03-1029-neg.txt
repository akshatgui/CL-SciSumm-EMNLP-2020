 $$$$$ Thus, the acquisition method described in Section 3 can be used to find the patterns for any type of slot fill.
 $$$$$ However, it is still observable that the Subtree model gains a few percent precision over the Chain model at recall levels around 40%.
 $$$$$ For example, (( C-ORG -SBJ) happyo-suru), “ C-ORG reports” may be the pattern used to extract an Organization in the Succession scenario but it is too general — it could match irrelevant sentences by mistake.
 $$$$$ An efficient procedure is required to select the appropriate patterns from among the candidates.

The idea of a self-customizing IE system emerged recently with the improvement of pattern acquisition techniques (Sudo et al, 2003b), where the IE system customizes itself across domains given by the user's query. $$$$$ The ranking of pattern candidates is inspired by TF/IDF scoring in IR literature; a pattern is more relevant when it appears more in the relevant document set and less across the entire collection of source documents.
The idea of a self-customizing IE system emerged recently with the improvement of pattern acquisition techniques (Sudo et al, 2003b), where the IE system customizes itself across domains given by the user's query. $$$$$ However, the Chain model also has its own weakness in terms of accuracy due to the lack of context.
The idea of a self-customizing IE system emerged recently with the improvement of pattern acquisition techniques (Sudo et al, 2003b), where the IE system customizes itself across domains given by the user's query. $$$$$ A possible explanation of the subtleness in performance difference in this scenario is the smaller number of contributing patterns compared to the Succession scenario.

Following (Sudo et al, 2003) we are interested only in the lexemes which are near neighbors of the most frequent verbs. $$$$$ However, some Predicate-Argument patterns may be too general, so that they could be applied to texts about a different scenario and mistakenly detect entities from them.

For example, Yangarber (2003) uses just subject-verb-object tuples while Sudo et al (2003) allow any subpart of the tree to act as an extraction pattern. $$$$$ In this paper, we discuss the limitations of prior extraction pattern representation models in relation to their ability to capture the participating entities in scenarios.

Sudo et al (2003) compared three models in terms of their ability to identify event participants. $$$$$ We present an alternative model based on subtrees of dependency trees, so as to extract entities beyond direct predicate-argument relations.

 $$$$$ The association of NE classes and slots in the template is made automatically; Person, Organization, Post (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, CORG, C-POST (NE-classes), respectively, in the Succession scenario, and Suspect, Arresting Agency, Charge (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, C-ORG, C-OFFENCE (NE-classes), respectively, in the Arrest scenario.
 $$$$$ Our research on improved representation models for extraction patterns is motivated by the limitations of the prior extraction pattern representations.

Subtrees $$$$$ Next, the area of the precision-recall curve is computed by connecting every point in the precision-recall curve from 0 to the maximum recall the pattern matching system reached, and we compare the area for each possible value.
Subtrees $$$$$ The pattern matching system, given a set of extraction patterns, classifies a document as retrieved if any of the patterns match any portion of the document, and as random otherwise.
Subtrees $$$$$ The unsupervised text classification task is to measure how close a pattern matching system, given a set of extraction patterns, simulates the document retrieval of the same IR system as in the previous sub-section.

 $$$$$ For a given set of extraction patterns, if pattern A subsumes pattern B (say, A is (shoot ( C-PERSON -OBJ)(to death)) and B is (shoot ( CPERSON -OBJ))), there is no added contribution for extraction by pattern matching with A (since all the matches with pattern A must be covered with pattern B).

For example, Sudo et al (2003) used patterns consisting of a path from a verb to any of its descendents (direct or indirect) while Bunescuand Mooney (2005) suggest the shortest path between the items being related. $$$$$ Since all the slot-fillers in the extraction task of our experiment are assumed to be instances of the 150 classes in the extended Named Entity hierarchy (Sekine et al., 2002), further filtering was done by requiring a pattern candidate to contain at least one Named Entity class.

An additional advantage of linked chain patterns is that they do not cause an unwieldy number of candidate patterns to be generated unlike some other approaches for representing extraction patterns, such as the one proposed by Sudo et al (2003) where any subtree of the dependency tree can act as a potential pattern. $$$$$ Although the scoring function described in Section 3.3 is the same for both models, the Subtree model can also produce contributing patterns, such as (( C-PERSON C-POST -SBJ)( C-POST -TO) shuninsuru) “ C-PERSON C-POST was appointed to C-POST ” whose ranks were higher than the problematic pattern.
