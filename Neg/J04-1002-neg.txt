To determine whether semantic restrictions are being violated, domain information from ontologies/thesauri such as WordNet could be used and/or statistical techniques as used by Mason (2004). $$$$$ CorMet’s discrimination is relatively coarse: It measures trends in selectional preferences across many documents, so common mappings are discernible.
To determine whether semantic restrictions are being violated, domain information from ontologies/thesauri such as WordNet could be used and/or statistical techniques as used by Mason (2004). $$$$$ CorMet works on domains that are specific and concrete (e.g., the domain of finance, but not that of actions).

Previous work on automated metaphor detection includes Fass (1991), Martin (1990), and Mason (2004). $$$$$ It does this by finding systematic variations in domain-specific selectional preferences, which are inferred from large, dynamically mined Internet corpora.

The CorMet system (Mason, 2004) dynamically mines domain specific corpora to find less frequent usages and identifies conceptual metaphors. $$$$$ Although MIDAS can quickly understand novel metaphors that are the descendants of metaphors in its memory, it cannot interpret compound metaphors or detect intermetaphor relationships besides inheritance.
The CorMet system (Mason, 2004) dynamically mines domain specific corpora to find less frequent usages and identifies conceptual metaphors. $$$$$ The concept pairs and corresponding domain pairs for the target metaphors in the Master Metaphor List are given in Table 18.

Mason (2004) shows how statistical analysis can automatically detect and extract conventional metaphors from corpora, though creative metaphors still remain a tantalizing challenge. $$$$$ CorMet uses gradients in selectional preferences learned from dynamically mined, domain-specific corpora to identify metaphoric mappings between concepts.
Mason (2004) shows how statistical analysis can automatically detect and extract conventional metaphors from corpora, though creative metaphors still remain a tantalizing challenge. $$$$$ It is a component of collative semantics, a semantics for natural language processing that has been implemented in the program meta5 (Fass, 1986, 1987, 1988).

 $$$$$ MetaBank (Martin 1994) is an empirically derived knowledge base of conventional metaphors designed for use in natural language applications.
 $$$$$ It does this by finding systematic variations in domain-specific selectional preferences, which are inferred from large, dynamically mined Internet corpora.
 $$$$$ CorMet computes a confidence measure for each metaphor it discovers.
 $$$$$ CorMet obtains documents by submitting queries to the Google search engine.

By finding semantic differences between the selectional preferences, it can articulate the higher-order structure of conceptual metaphors ((Mason, 2004), p. 24), finding mappings like LIQUID -> MONEY. $$$$$ It has successfully found some of the conventional metaphors on the Master Metaphor List.

CorMet (Mason, 2004) is designed to extract known conventional metaphors from domain-specific textual corpora, which are derived from Google queries. $$$$$ Although CorMet’s only knowledge base is WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) it can find the mappings constituting many conventional metaphors and in some cases recognize sentences instantiating those mappings.

The CMI system described in this paper is informed largely by CorMet (Mason, 2004). $$$$$ The verbs that select for a concept in the source domain tend to select for its metaphorical equivalent in the target domain.
The CMI system described in this paper is informed largely by CorMet (Mason, 2004). $$$$$ In this context, a domain is a set of related concepts, and a domain-specific corpus is a set of documents relevant to those concepts.

 $$$$$ That this mapping appears in a search not targeted to it reflects this metaphor’s strength.
 $$$$$ For instance, ECONOMIC HARM IS PHYSICAL INJURY seems to be captured by the mapping from the loss-3 cluster to the harm-1 cluster.

Our method is different from automated work on metaphor recognition such as (Mason, 2004) and (Gedigian et al, 2006) in that it includes nouns as parts of speech. $$$$$ CorMet found no mapping between THEORY and ARCHITECTURE.

Our method is different from automated work on metaphor recognition such as (Mason, 2004) and (Gedigian et al, 2006) in that it includes nouns as parts of speech. $$$$$ Metaphors transfer structure from a source domain to a target domain, making some concepts in the target domain metaphorically equivalent to concepts in the source domain.
