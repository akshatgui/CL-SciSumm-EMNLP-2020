Previous work on automated metaphor detection includes Fass (1991), Martin (1990), and Mason (2004). $$$$$ It is worth noting that WordNet, CorMet’s primary knowledge source, implicitly encodes some of the metaphors CorMet is intended to find; Peters and Peters (2000) use WordNet to find many artifact/cognition metaphors.
Previous work on automated metaphor detection includes Fass (1991), Martin (1990), and Mason (2004). $$$$$ Note that Cormet is designed to detect higherorder conceptual metaphors by finding some of the sentences embodying some of the interconcept mappings constituting the metaphor of interest but is not designed to be a tool for reliably detecting all instances of a particular metaphor.

The CorMet system (Mason, 2004) dynamically mines domain specific corpora to find less frequent usages and identifies conceptual metaphors. $$$$$ To find domain-characteristic verbs, CorMet dynamically obtains a large sample of domain-relevant documents, decomposes them into a bag-of-words representation, stems the words with an implementation of the Porter (1980) stemmer, and finds the ratio of occurrences of each word stem to the total number of stems in the domain corpus.
The CorMet system (Mason, 2004) dynamically mines domain specific corpora to find less frequent usages and identifies conceptual metaphors. $$$$$ Accuracy could be improved by refining the process by which domain-specific corpora are obtained to eliminate administrative documents or by requiring documents to have a higher density of domain-relevant terms.

 $$$$$ By comparing this selectional preference with pour’s selectional preferences in the LAB domain, CorMet can infer a metaphorical mapping from money to liquids.
 $$$$$ This section describes the evaluation of CorMet against a gold standard, specifically, by determining how many of the metaphors in a subset of the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991) can be discovered by CorMet given a characterization of the relevant source and target domains.

By finding semantic differences between the selectional preferences, it can articulate the higher-order structure of conceptual metaphors ((Mason, 2004), p. 24), finding mappings like LIQUID -> MONEY. $$$$$ Most other computational metaphor systems use small, hand-coded semantic knowledge bases and work on a few examples.

CorMet (Mason, 2004) is designed to extract known conventional metaphors from domain-specific textual corpora, which are derived from Google queries. $$$$$ This fraction is surprisingly small: It turns out that the bulk of the Master Metaphor List consists of subtle refinements of a few highly abstract metaphors.
CorMet (Mason, 2004) is designed to extract known conventional metaphors from domain-specific textual corpora, which are derived from Google queries. $$$$$ Pour, for instance, occurs three times as often in FINANCE and twentythree times as often in LAB as it does in general English.

CorMet (Mason, 2004) is designed to extract known conventional metaphors from domain-specific textual corpora, which are derived from Google queries. $$$$$ The hierarchical structure of conventional metaphor is a regularity not captured by other computational approaches.

The CMI system described in this paper is informed largely by CorMet (Mason, 2004). $$$$$ Although CorMet’s only knowledge base is WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) it can find the mappings constituting many conventional metaphors and in some cases recognize sentences instantiating those mappings.

The CMI system described in this paper is informed largely by CorMet (Mason, 2004). $$$$$ CorMet’s inputs are two domain sets of characteristic keywords for each domain (Table 4).

 $$$$$ This metaphor is driven primarily by institutions’ capacity to dissolve.
 $$$$$ Metaphors transfer structure from a source domain to a target domain, making some concepts in the target domain metaphorically equivalent to concepts in the source domain.
 $$$$$ Is it meaningful when CorMet finds a mapping, or will it find a mapping between any pair of domains?
 $$$$$ WordNet can hardly be blamed: The task of recording all possible relationships between all English words is prohibitively large, if not infinite.

 $$$$$ The mappings discovered that best represent the targeted metaphors are shown in Table 19.
 $$$$$ The numbers associated with the nodes are the bits of uncertainty about the identity of a word x resolved by the fact that x fills the given case slot, or P(x +— N) − P(x +— N|case slot(x)) (where x +— N is read as x is N or a hyponym of N).

Our method is different from automated work on metaphor recognition such as (Mason, 2004) and (Gedigian et al, 2006) in that it includes nouns as parts of speech. $$$$$ Structure flow in the opposite direction is selection strength(X, β,A).
