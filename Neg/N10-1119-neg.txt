Recent work in this area includes Velikovich et al (2010), who developed a method for automatically deriving an extensive sentiment lexicon from the web as a whole. $$$$$ As a result, the lexicon is not limited to specific word classes – e.g., adjectives that occur in WordNet – and in fact contains slang, misspellings, multiword expressions, etc.
Recent work in this area includes Velikovich et al (2010), who developed a method for automatically deriving an extensive sentiment lexicon from the web as a whole. $$$$$ To classify sentences as being positive, negative or neutral, we used an augmented vote-flip algorithm (Choi and Cardie, 2009), which is given in Figure 3.
Recent work in this area includes Velikovich et al (2010), who developed a method for automatically deriving an extensive sentiment lexicon from the web as a whole. $$$$$ Adjectives phrases are then extracted from these sentences based on different statistics of their occurrence in the positive or negative set.

We examine two methods for sentiment detection that of Brody and Elhadad (2010) for detecting sentiment in reviews, and that of Velikovich et al (2010) for finding sentiment terms in a giga-scale web corpus. $$$$$ Previous studies on constructing polarity lexicons from lexical graphs, e.g., Rao and Ravichandran (2009), have used the label propagation algorithm, which takes the form in Figure 2 (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002).

Velikovich et al (2010) constructed a graph where the nodes were 20 million candidate words or phrases, selected using a set of heuristics including frequency and mutual information of word boundaries. $$$$$ Whereas the Wilson et al. (2005) and WordNet lexicon have a recall of only 3% relative to the web lexicon, the web lexicon has a recall of 48% and 70% relative to the two other lexicons, indicating that it contains a significant amount of information from the other lexicons.
Velikovich et al (2010) constructed a graph where the nodes were 20 million candidate words or phrases, selected using a set of heuristics including frequency and mutual information of word boundaries. $$$$$ To this end we compare three different lexicons: Table 1 breaks down the lexicon by the number of positive and negative entries of each lexicon, which clearly shows that the lexicon derived from the web is more than an order of magnitude larger than previously constructed lexicons.2 This in and of itself is not much of an achievement if the additional phrases are of poor quality.

On the other hand, the method of Velikovich et al (2010) is based on huge amounts of data, and takes advantage of the abundance of contextual information available in full documents, whereas our domain is closer to that of Brody and Elhadad (2010), who dealt with a small number of candidates and short documents typical to online reviews. $$$$$ We examine the viability of building large polarity lexicons semi-automatically from the web.

Once the graph is constructed, we can use either of the propagation algorithms of Brody and Elhadad (2010) and Velikovich et al (2010), which we will denote Reviews and Web, respectively. $$$$$ In the rest of this section we investigate the properties of this lexicon to understand both its general characteristics as well as its possible utility in sentiment applications.

Velikovich et al (2010) employed a different label propagation method, as described in Figure 3. $$$$$ We begin by describing a graph propagation framework inspired by previous work on constructing polarity lexicons from lexical graphs (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004; Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009; Blair- Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).

 $$$$$ Extracting polarity lexicons from the web has been investigated previously by Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2007), who study the problem exclusively for Japanese.

In Velikovich et al (2010), the parameters were tuned on a held out dataset. $$$$$ In particular, we might see a number of edges between positive and negative sentiment words as well as sentiment words and non-sentiment words, e.g., sentiment adjectives and all other adjectives that are distributionally similar.

Top fifteen negative and positive words for the algorithms of Brody and Elhadad (2010) (Reviews) and Velikovich et al (2010) (Web). $$$$$ Our qualitative experiments indicate that the web derived lexicon can include a wide range of phrases that have not been available to previous systems, most notably spelling variations, slang, vulgarity, and multiword expressions.

Although such an assumption played a key role in previous work for the analogous task of learning sentiment lexicon (Velikovich et al, 2010), we expect that the same assumption would be less reliable in drawing subtle connotative sentiments of words. $$$$$ This should not be surprising, since in a graph induced from the web, a phrase like “cancer” (or any disease) should be distributionally similar to phrases like “illness”, “sick”, and “death”, which themselves will be similar to standard sentiment phrases like “bad” and “terrible”.

 $$$$$ If we plot the precision-recall graphs using purity to classify sentences – as opposed to the voteflip algorithm, which only provides an unweighted classification – we can see that at almost all recall levels the web-derived lexicon has superior precision to the other lexicons (Figure 4).
 $$$$$ These results hold true both when the lexicons are used in conjunction with string matching to classify sentences, and when they are included within a contextual classifier framework (Wilson et al., 2005).

A technique named label propagation (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) has been used by Rao and Ravichandran (2009) and Velikovich et al (2010), while random walk based approaches, PageRank in particular, have been used by Esuli and Sebastiani (2007). $$$$$ We assume as input an undirected edge weighted graph G = (V, E), where wij E [0, 1] is the weight of edge (vi, vj) E E.

However in recent years, sentiment lexicons started expanding to include some of those words that simply associate with sentiment, even if those words are purely objective (e.g., Velikovich et al (2010), Baccianellaet al (2010)). $$$$$ Phrases that are connected to multiple positive seed words through short yet highly weighted paths will receive high positive values.

In order to collectively induce the visually descriptive words from this graph, we apply the graph propagation algorithm of Velikovich et al (2010), a variant of label propagation algorithms (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) that has been shown to be effective for inducing a web-scale polarity lexicon based on word co-occurrence statistics. $$$$$ Ultimately, a meta classifier that incorporates features from all lexicons provides the best performance.
