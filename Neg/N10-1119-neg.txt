Velikovich et al (2010) constructed a graph where the nodes were 20 million candidate words or phrases, selected using a set of heuristics including frequency and mutual information of word boundaries. $$$$$ Our experiments show that a web-derived lexicon is not only significantly larger, but has improved accuracy on a sentence polarity classification task, which is an important problem in many sentiment analysis applications, including sentiment aggregation and summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004; Carenini et al., 2006; Lerman et al., 2009).

On the other hand, the method of Velikovich et al (2010) is based on huge amounts of data, and takes advantage of the abundance of contextual information available in full documents, whereas our domain is closer to that of Brody and Elhadad (2010), who dealt with a small number of candidates and short documents typical to online reviews. $$$$$ However, in Section 3.2 we present an empirical evaluation that suggests that these terms provide both additional and useful information.

 $$$$$ To rank sentences we defined the purity of a sentence X as the normalized sum of the sentiment scores for each phrase x in the sentence: This is a normalized score in the range [−1, 1].
 $$$$$ Additionally, negative phrases in the graph appeared to be in more densely connected regions, which resulted in the final lexicons being highly skewed towards negative entries due to the influence of multiple paths to seed words.
 $$$$$ In the rest of this section we investigate the properties of this lexicon to understand both its general characteristics as well as its possible utility in sentiment applications.
