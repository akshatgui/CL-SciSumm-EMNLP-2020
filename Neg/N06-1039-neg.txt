Our work is related to previous work on domain independent unsupervised relation extraction, in particular Sekine (2006), Shinyama and Sekine (2006) and Banko et al (2007). $$$$$ First we computed a word vector from each article: where Vw(A) is a vector element of word w in article A, IDF(w) is the inverse document frequency of word w, and POS(w, A) is a list of w’s positions in the article. avgwords is the average number of words for all articles.

An alternative paradigm, Open IE, pioneered by the TextRunner system (Banko et al., 2007) and the "preemptive IE" in (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), aims to handle an unbounded number of relations and run quickly enough to process Webscale corpora. $$$$$ The number of the source articles that contained a mention of the hurricane is shown in the right column.

Our work focuses on a recent line of exploratory work in the direction of Unrestricted Relation Discovery which is defined as: the automatic identification of different relations in text without specifying a relation or set of relations in advance (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006). $$$$$ First, you have to specify the type of information you want and collect articles that include this information.
