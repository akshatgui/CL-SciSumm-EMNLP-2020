Crowdsourcing services, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and CrowdFlower, have been recently used with success for a variety of NLP applications (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010). $$$$$ In this paper we give an introduction to using Amazon?s Mechanical Turk crowdsourc ing platform for the purpose of collecting data for human language technologies.

Crowdsourcing services, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and CrowdFlower, have been recently used with success for a variety of NLP applications (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010). $$$$$ Turkers who fail the controls can be blocked and their labels can be excluded from the final data set.

Corpus creation using AMT has numerous precedents now; see i.e. Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010) and Heilman and Smith (2010b). $$$$$ Howcan we ensure high quality annotations from crowd sourced contributors?To begin addressing these questions, we orga nized an open-ended $100 shared task.
Corpus creation using AMT has numerous precedents now; see i.e. Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010) and Heilman and Smith (2010b). $$$$$ Researchers were given $100 of credit on Amazon MechanicalTurk to spend on an annotation task of their choosing.

A number of researchers have recently experimented with the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to create and evaluate human language data (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010). $$$$$ 24 researchers participated in the workshop?s shared task to create data for speech and language applications with $100.
A number of researchers have recently experimented with the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to create and evaluate human language data (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010). $$$$$ Because Mechanical Turkallows researchers to experiment with crowdsourc ing by providing small incentives to Turkers, other successful crowdsourcing efforts like Wikipedia or Games with a Purpose (von Ahn and Dabbish, 2008) also share something in common with MTurk.

Over the last several of years, Mechanical Turk, introduced by Amazon as artificial artificial intelligence, has been used successfully for a number of NLP tasks, including robust evaluation of machine translation systems by reading comprehension (Callison-Burch, 2009), and other tasks explored in the recent NAACL workshop (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010b). $$$$$ Additionally, even withefforts to clean up MTurk annotations, we can ex pect an increase in noisy examples in data.

A number of mechanisms for quality control have been proposed for use with Mechanical Turk annotation (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010a). $$$$$ Ambati and Vogel create corpora with 100 sentences and 3 translations per sentence for all the language pairs between English, Spanish, Urdu and Telugu.
A number of mechanisms for quality control have been proposed for use with Mechanical Turk annotation (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010a). $$$$$ Mason and Watts (2009) present a study of financial incentives on Mechanical Turk and find, counterintuitively, thatincreasing the amount of compensation for a partic ular task does not tend to improve the quality of theresults.
A number of mechanisms for quality control have been proposed for use with Mechanical Turk annotation (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010a). $$$$$ If pos sible, you should include a small amount of gold standard data in each HIT.
A number of mechanisms for quality control have been proposed for use with Mechanical Turk annotation (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010a). $$$$$ Others haveused MTurk for novel research directions like nonsimulated active learning for NLP tasks such as sen timent classification (Hsueh et al, 2009) or doingquixotic things like doing human-in-the-loop min imum error rate training for machine translation (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2009).Some projects have demonstrated the super scalability of crowdsourced efforts.

That paper appeared in a NAACL 2010 workshop organized by Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010), focusing on MTurk as a source of data for speech and language tasks. $$$$$ Although it is hard to define a set of ?best practices?
That paper appeared in a NAACL 2010 workshop organized by Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010), focusing on MTurk as a source of data for speech and language tasks. $$$$$ They evaluated three HITs for collecting such data and compared results for quality and expressiveness.
That paper appeared in a NAACL 2010 workshop organized by Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010), focusing on MTurk as a source of data for speech and language tasks. $$$$$ They evaluated translation candidates for 100 English words in 32 languages and solicited translations for 10 additional languages.

Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010) provide an overview of various tasks for which MTurk has been used, and offer a set of best practices for ensuring high-quality data. $$$$$ Researchers submitted a 1 page proposalto the workshop organizers that described their in tended experiments and expected outcomes.
Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010) provide an overview of various tasks for which MTurk has been used, and offer a set of best practices for ensuring high-quality data. $$$$$ Learning across multiple annotations may improve sys tems (Dredze et al, 2009).
Callison-Burch and Dredze (2010) provide an overview of various tasks for which MTurk has been used, and offer a set of best practices for ensuring high-quality data. $$$$$ Turkers in Pakistan require less careful scrutiny since they are more likely to be bilingual Urdu speakers than those in Romania, for instance.CrowdFlower4 provides an interface for design ing HITs that includes a phase for the Requester toinput gold standard data with known labels.
