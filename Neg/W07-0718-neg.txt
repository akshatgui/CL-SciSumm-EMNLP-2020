Although BLEU has played a crucial role in the progress of MT research, it is becoming evident that BLEU does not correlate with human judgement well enough, and suffers from several other deficiencies such as the lack of an intuitive interpretation of its scores. During the recent ACL-07 workshop on statistical MT (Callison-Burch et al, 2007), a total of automatic MT evaluation metrics were evaluated for correlation with human judgement. $$$$$ The automatic evaluation metrics strongly favor the University of Edinburgh, which garners 41% of the top-ranked entries (which is partially due to the fact it was entered in every language pair).
