(Aw et al, 2006) proposed an approach for normalizing Short Messaging Service (SMS) texts by translating it into normalized forms using Phrase-based SMT techniques on character level. $$$$$ Thus we need to consider only monotone alignment at phrase level, i.e., k , as in equation (4).

(Aw et al, 2006) proposed an approach for normalizing Short Messaging Service (SMS) texts by translating it into normalized forms using Phrase-based SMT techniques on character level. $$$$$ Clark (2003) proposed to unify the process of tokenization, segmentation and spelling correction for normalization of general noisy text (rather than SMS or instant messaging texts) based on a noisy channel model at the character level.

 $$$$$ This experiment results provide us with a good indication on the feasibility of using this method in performing the normalization task.
 $$$$$ Similarly to Aw et al. (2005), we focus on the three major cases of transformation as shown in the corpus: (1) replacement of OOV words and non-standard SMS lingoes; (2) removal of slang and (3) insertion of auxiliary or copula verb and subject pronoun.
 $$$$$ We view the SMS language as a variant of English language with some derivations in vocabulary and grammar.
 $$$$$ We obtain an average of 0.3770 BLEU score for normalized messages against 0.1926 for raw messages.

Parsing performance on noisy data can be improved by transforming the input data so that it resembles the parser's training data (Aw et al, 2006), transforming the training data so that it resembles the input data (van der Plas et al, 2009), applying semi supervised techniques such as the self-training protocol used by McClosky et al (2006), and changing the parser internals, e.g. adapting the parser's unknown word model to take into account variation in capitalisation and function word misspelling. $$$$$ The baseline experiment is to moderate the texts using a lingo dictionary comprises 142 normalization pairs, which is also used in bootstrapping the phrase alignment learning process.
