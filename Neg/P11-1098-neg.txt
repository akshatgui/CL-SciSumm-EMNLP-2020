The use of case frames is well grounded in a variety of NLP tasks relevant to summarization such as coreference resolution (Bean and Riloff, 2004), and information extraction (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), where they serve the central unit of semantic analysis. $$$$$ The final experiment in figure 7 shows that perhaps new work should first focus on pattern learning and entity extraction, rather than document identification.

For example, Patwardhan and Riloff (2007) and Chambers and Jurafsky (2011) consider an IE approach where the extraction targets are MUC-4 style document-level templates (Sundheim, 1991), the former a supervised system and the latter fully unsupervised. $$$$$ Let g(wi, wj) be the distance between two events (1 if in the same sentence, 2 in neighboring, etc).
