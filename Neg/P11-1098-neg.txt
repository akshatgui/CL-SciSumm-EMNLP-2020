The use of case frames is well grounded in a variety of NLP tasks relevant to summarization such as coreference resolution (Bean and Riloff, 2004), and information extraction (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), where they serve the central unit of semantic analysis. $$$$$ We approach this problem with a three step process: (1) cluster the domain’s event patterns to approximate the template topics, (2) build a new corpus specific to each cluster by retrieving documents from a larger unrelated corpus, (3) induce each template’s slots using its new (larger) corpus of documents.
