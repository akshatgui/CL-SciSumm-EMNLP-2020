Similarly to Mann and Yarowsky (2001), we show that languages are often close enough to others within their language family so that cognate pairs between the two are common, and significant portions of the translation lexicon can be induced with high accuracy where no bilingual dictionary or parallel corpora may exist. $$$$$ The authors would like to thank the following people for their insightful comments and feedback on drafts of this work: Radu Florian, Jan Hajie, Ellen Riloff, Charles Schafer, and Richard Wicentowski.

Mann and Yarowsky (2001) saw little improvement over Edit Distance when applying this transducer to cognates, even when filtering the transducer's probabilities into different weight classes to better approximate Edit Distance. $$$$$ Perhaps the most comprehensive study of word alignment via string transduction methods was pioneered by Knight and Graehl (1998).

For example, Mann and Yarowsky (2001) define a word pair (e, f) to be cognate if they are a translation pair (same meaning) and their Edit Distance is less than three (same form). $$$$$ For language pairs with existing translation lexicons, these methods can help improve coverage, especially for technical vocabulary and other more recent borrowings which are often cognate but frequently missing from existing dictionaries.

The marked difference in the availability of monolingual vs parallel corpora has led several researchers to develop methods for automatically learning bilingual lexicons, either by using monolingual corpora (Rapp, 1999; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Haghighi et al., 2008) or by exploiting the cross-language evidence of closely related "bridge" languages that have more resources (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001). $$$$$ When translating from English to one of the Romance languages, using Spanish as the bridge language achieves the highest accuracy; and using Russian as the bridge language achieves the best performance when translating from English to the Slavic languages.
