 $$$$$ Recent work has challenged the assumption that word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems areuseful for SMT.
 $$$$$ phrase-based SMT architectures It is non-trivial to incorporate WSD into an existing phrase-based architecture such as Pharaoh (Koehn,2004), since the decoder is not set up to easily accept multiple translation probabilities that are dy namically computed in context-sensitive fashion.

Unlike a full blown machine translation task (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), annotators and systems are not required to translate the whole context but just the target word. $$$$$ Instead of using predefined senses drawn from manually constructed sense inventories such asHowNet (Dong, 1998), our WSD for SMT sys tem directly disambiguates between all phrasaltranslation candidates seen during SMT train ing.
