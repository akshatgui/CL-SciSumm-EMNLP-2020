The small amount of previous work on the identification of syntactic fixedness (Wermter and Hahn (2004), Fazly and Stevenson (2006)) has either focused on a single variation variety, or has only been evaluated for combinations of a small preselected list of words, presumably due to noise. $$$$$ For example, the lexical representation of shoot, breeze should include shoot the breeze as a Cform.
