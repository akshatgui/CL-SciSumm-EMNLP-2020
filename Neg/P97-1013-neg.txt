The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first order formatioon of valid text structures (Marcu, 1997b). $$$$$ In the work described here, we investigate how far we can get by focusing our attention only on discourse markers and lexicogrammatical constructs that can be detected by a shallow analysis of natural language texts.
The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first order formatioon of valid text structures (Marcu, 1997b). $$$$$ For example, when the cue phrase &quot;Although&quot; is identified, it is also assigned a discourse usage.
The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first order formatioon of valid text structures (Marcu, 1997b). $$$$$ The decision of whether a cue phrase is considered to have a discourse usage is sometimes based on the context in which that phrase occurs, i.e., it depends on the occurrence of other cue phrases.

Document structure (WD) is another important clue in determining which elements of a text are important enough to include in a summary (Marcu, 1997). $$$$$ The method, procedure, and results of our corpus analysis are discussed in section 3.

Most recently, Marcu (1997) has described a method for text summarization based on nuclearity and selective retention of hierarchical fragments. $$$$$ In order to make rhetorical parsing work, we improved previous algorithms for cue phrase disambiguation, and proposed new algorithms for determining the elementary textual units and for computing the valid discourse trees of a text.

 $$$$$ In contrast with this previous work, the rhetorical parser that we present builds discourse trees for unrestricted texts.
 $$$$$ Given the above discussion, the immediate objection that one can raise is that discourse markers are doubly ambiguous: in some cases, their use is only sentential, i.e., they make a semantic contribution to the interpretation of a clause; and even in the cases where markers have a discourse usage, they are ambiguous with respect to the rhetorical relations that they mark and the sizes of the textual spans that they connect.
 $$$$$ Acknowledgements.
 $$$$$ In fact, the discourse marker that is responsible for most of our algorithm recall failures is and.

Since discourse markers, such as because and and, have been shown to play a major role in rhetorical parsing (Marcu, 1997), we also consider a list of features that specify whether a lexeme found within the local contextual window is a potential discourse marker. $$$$$ This research would have not been possible without the help of Graeme Hirst; there are no right words to thank him for it.

Our task is similar to the concept of discourse parsing (Marcu (1997)), where discourse structures are extracted from the text. $$$$$ I am grateful to Melanie Baljko, Phil Edmonds, and Steve Green for their help with the corpus analysis.
Our task is similar to the concept of discourse parsing (Marcu (1997)), where discourse structures are extracted from the text. $$$$$ Since a shallow analyzer cannot identify with sufficient precision whether an occurrence of and has a discourse or a sentential usage, most of its occurrences are therefore ignored.
Our task is similar to the concept of discourse parsing (Marcu (1997)), where discourse structures are extracted from the text. $$$$$ The most important criterion for using a cue phrase in the marker identification procedure is that the cue phrase (together with its orthographic neighborhood) is used as a discourse marker in at least 90% of the examples that were extracted from the corpus.

 $$$$$ The algorithms use information that was derived from a corpus analysis of cue phrases.
 $$$$$ At the time of writing, we have identified 1253 occurrences of cue phrases that exhibit discourse usages and associated with each of them procedures that instruct a shallow analyzer how the surrounding text should be broken into textual units.

Marcu (1997) describes a rhetorical parsing approach which takes unrestricted text as input and derives the rhetorical structure tree. $$$$$ On the other hand, although the theories described by Grosz and Sidner (1986), Polanyi (1988), and Mann and Thompson (1988) are successfully applied manually, they are too informal to support an automatic approach to discourse analysis.

One exception is Marcu's work (Marcu, 1997, 1999) (see also Soricut and Marcu (2003) for constructing discourse structures for individual sentences). $$$$$ We first discuss the key concepts on which our approach relies (section 2) and the corpus analysis (section 3) that provides the empirical data for our rhetorical parsing algorithm.
One exception is Marcu's work (Marcu, 1997, 1999) (see also Soricut and Marcu (2003) for constructing discourse structures for individual sentences). $$$$$ However, given that the structure that we are trying to build is highly constrained, such a prediction proved to be unnecessary: the overall constraints on the structure of discourse that we enumerated in the beginning of this section cancel out most of the configurations of elementary constraints that do not yield correct discourse trees.
One exception is Marcu's work (Marcu, 1997, 1999) (see also Soricut and Marcu (2003) for constructing discourse structures for individual sentences). $$$$$ As a consequence, we assume that one can bootstrap the full syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis of the clauses that make up a text and still end up with a reliable discourse structure for that text.

Our segmentation is linear, rather than hierarchical (Marcu 1997 and Yaari 1997), i.e. the input article is divided into a linear sequence of adjacent segments. $$$$$ Researchers of natural language have repeatedly acknowledged that texts are not just a sequence of words nor even a sequence of clauses and sentences.

Considering the problem from another angle, discourse approaches have focused on shorter units than multi-paragraph segments, but Rhetorical Structure Theory (Marcu 1997 and others) may be able to scale up to associate rhetorical functions with segments. $$$$$ We discuss then an algorithm that recognizes discourse usages of cue phrases and that determines clause boundaries within sentences.
