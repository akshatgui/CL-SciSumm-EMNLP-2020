Most recently, Marcu (1997) has described a method for text summarization based on nuclearity and selective retention of hierarchical fragments. $$$$$ On average, we randomly selected approximately 19 text fragments per marker, having few texts for the markers that do not occur very often in the corpus and up to 60 text fragments for markers such as and, which we considered to be highly ambiguous.

Most recently, Marcu (1997) has described a method for text summarization based on nuclearity and selective retention of hierarchical fragments. $$$$$ In order to measure this agreement we associated an importance score to each textual unit in a tree and computed the Spearman correlation coefficients between the importance scores derived from the discourse trees built by each analyst.2 The Spearman correlation coefficient between the ranks assigned for each textual unit on the bases of the discourse trees built by the two analysts was very high: 0.798, at p < 0.0001 level of significance.

 $$$$$ Such an assignment will only create problems at the formal level as well, because then discourse structures can no longer be represented as binary trees.

Since discourse markers, such as because and and, have been shown to play a major role in rhetorical parsing (Marcu, 1997), we also consider a list of features that specify whether a lexeme found within the local contextual window is a potential discourse marker. $$$$$ We derive the rhetorical structures of texts by means of two new, surface-form-based algorithms: one that identifies discourse usages of cue phrases and breaks sentences into clauses, and one that produces valid rhetorical structure trees for unrestricted natural language texts.

Our task is similar to the concept of discourse parsing (Marcu (1997)), where discourse structures are extracted from the text. $$$$$ On one hand, efforts such as those described by Asher (1993), Lascarides, Asher, and Oberlander (1992), Kamp and Reyle (1993), Grover et al. (1994), and PrUst, Scha, and van den Berg (1994) take the position that discourse structures can be built only in conjunction with fully specified clause and sentence structures.

Argumentation belongs to discourse analysis, with fairly complex computational models such as the implementation of the rhetorical structure theory proposed by (Marcu, 1997), which proposes dozens of rhetorical classes. $$$$$ However, Sumita et al.

Marcu (1997) describes a rhetorical parsing approach which takes unrestricted text as input and derives the rhetorical structure tree. $$$$$ For example, relation rhet_re/(ELABoRATIoN, 3, 1) will be ruled out because unit 1 is not an important unit for span [1,2] and, as mentioned at the beginning of this section, a rhetorical relation that holds between two spans of a valid text structure must also hold between their most important units: the important unit of span [1,2] is unit 2, i.e., the nucleus of the relation r het fel(cONCESSION , 1,2).

Considering the problem from another angle, discourse approaches have focused on shorter units than multi-paragraph segments, but Rhetorical Structure Theory (Marcu 1997 and others) may be able to scale up to associate rhetorical functions with segments. $$$$$ 5.

In the approach proposed in (Marcu, 1997), for example, the presence of discourse markers is used to hypothesize individual textual units and relations holding between them. $$$$$ And Hobbs's theory (1990) assumes that sophisticated knowledge bases and inference mechanisms are needed for determining the relations between discourse units.

Marcu (1997) parsed documents as rhetorical trees and identified important sentences based on the trees. $$$$$ The words in italics denote the discourse markers, the square brackets denote 'In fact, journalists are trained to employ this &quot;pyramid&quot; approach to writing consciously (Cumming and McKercher, 1994). the boundaries of elementary textual units, and the curly brackets denote the boundaries of parenthetical textual units that were determined by the rhetorical parser (see Marcu (1997) for details); the numbers associated with the square brackets are identification labels.
