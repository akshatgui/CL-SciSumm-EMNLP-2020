We choose a window of [-2,2], as it is usually suggested by the literature (Choi et al., 2005). $$$$$ Sim ilarly, an IE system that extracts information about terrorism must distinguish between the person who is the perpetrator and the person who is the victim.We hypothesized that IE techniques would be well suited for source identification because an opinion statement can be viewed as a kind of speech event with the source as the agent.
We choose a window of [-2,2], as it is usually suggested by the literature (Choi et al., 2005). $$$$$ pattern.Each extraction pattern has frequency and prob ability values produced by AutoSlog-SE, hence we create four IE pattern-based features for each token xi: SourcePatt-Freq, SourceExtr-Freq, SourcePatt-Prob, and SourceExtr-Prob, where the frequency values are divided into threeranges: {0, 1, 2+} and the probability values are di vided into five ranges of equal size.
We choose a window of [-2,2], as it is usually suggested by the literature (Choi et al., 2005). $$$$$ The probability or the strength of an opinion expression may also play a useful role in encouraging or suppressing source extraction.

The features we use (Table 5) are mostly inspired by Choi et al (2005) and by the ones used for plain support vector machines (SVMs) in (Wiegand and Klakow, 2010). $$$$$ This work wassupported by the Advanced Research and Develop ment Activity (ARDA), by NSF Grants IIS-0208028 and IIS-0208985, and by the Xerox Foundation.
The features we use (Table 5) are mostly inspired by Choi et al (2005) and by the ones used for plain support vector machines (SVMs) in (Wiegand and Klakow, 2010). $$$$$ We have described a hybrid approach to the problem of extracting sources of opinions in text.
