We build from Dickinson et al. (2010) in two main ways: first, we implement a presence-selection pipeline that has proven effective for English preposition error detection (cf. Gamon et al., 2008). $$$$$ For example, the original choice of preposition made in the native text would serve as supervision for the evaluation of the preposition module.

 $$$$$ For example, while many non-native speakers may encounter difficulty choosing among prepositions, this is typically not a significant problem for native speakers and hence remains unaddressed in proofing tools such as the grammar checker in Microsoft Word (Heidorn 2000).
