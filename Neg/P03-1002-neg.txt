The benefit of semantic roles has already been demonstrated for a number of tasks, among others for machine translation (Boas, 2002), information extraction (Surdeanu et al, 2003), and question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004). $$$$$ Surprisingly, the phrasal verb collocation features did not help for any of the tasks, but they were useful for boosting the decision trees.
