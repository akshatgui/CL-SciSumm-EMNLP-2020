Indeed, the analysis produced by existing semantic role labelers has been shown to benefit a wide spectrum of applications ranging from information extraction (Surdeanu et al, 2003) and question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007), to machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009) and summarization (Melli et al, 2005). $$$$$ The proposed approach achieves over 88% F-measure for the problem of identifying argument constituents, and over 83% accuracy for the task of assigning roles to pre-identified argument constituents.
