Wu and Fung (2009) used SRL labels for reordering the n-best output of phrase-based translation systems. $$$$$ But whereas Ueffing et al. take the output from a first-pass rulebased MT system, and then correct it using a second-pass SMT system, our two-pass semantic SMT model does the reverse: it takes the output from a first-pass SMT system, and then corrects it with the aid of semantic analyzers.
