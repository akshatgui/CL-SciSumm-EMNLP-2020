Wu and Fung (2009) demonstrated the promise of using features based on semantic predicate argument structure in machine translation, using these feature to re-rank machine translation output. $$$$$ It has often been noted that the dominance of lexically-oriented, precisionbased metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002) tend to reward fluency more than adequacy.

Recent years have witnessed increasing efforts towards integrating predicate-argument structures into statistical machine translation (SMT) (Wu and Fung, 2009b; Liu and Gildea, 2010). $$$$$ In fact, the lack of easy compositionality is the reason that today’s most accurate shallow semantic parsers rely not primarily on compositional parsing techniques, but rather on ensembles of predictors that independently rate/rank a wide variety of factors supporting the role assignments given a broad sentence-wide range of context features.
