 $$$$$ We showed how to use integer linear programming to encode transitivity constraints in a coreference classifier which models pairwise decisions over mentions.
 $$$$$ For this goal, we put aside the anaphoricity classifier and focus on the pairwise classifier and transitivity constraints.
 $$$$$ This paper is based on work funded by the Disruptive Technology Office (DTO) Phase III Program for Advanced Question Answering for Intelligence (AQUAINT).
 $$$$$ Other work on global models of coreference (as opposed to pairwise models) has included: Luo et al. (2004) who used a Bell tree whose leaves represent possible partitionings of the mentions into entities and then trained a model for searching the tree; McCallum and Wellner (2004) who defined several conditional random field-based models; Ng (2005) who took a reranking approach; and Culotta et al.

On the MUC6-TEST dataset, our system outperforms both Poon and Domingos (2008) (an unsupervised Markov Logic Network system which uses explicit constraints) and Finkel and Manning (2008) (a supervised system which uses ILP inference to reconcile the predictions of a pairwise classifier) on all comparable measures. $$$$$ Note that this model is degenerate, because it assigns probability mass to nonsensical clusterings.
