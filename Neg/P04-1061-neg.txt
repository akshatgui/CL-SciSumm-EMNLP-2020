 $$$$$ Nonetheless, we see the investigation of what patterns can be recovered from corpora as important, both from a computational perspective and from a philosophical one.
 $$$$$ From the CCM we must generate isk as a constituent and its corresponding context.

However, previous computational models of grammar induction (Klein and Manning, 2004), including infant grammar induction (Kwiatkowski et al, 2012), have not addressed filler-gap comprehension. $$$$$ The following recursion defines the probability of the fragment D(h) of the dependency tree rooted at h: One can view a structure generated by this derivational process as a “lexicalized” tree composed of the local binary and unary context-free configurations shown in figure 4.3 Each configuration equivalently represents either a head-outward derivation step or a context-free rewrite rule.

In the field of language acquisition computational linguists such as Klein and Manning (2004) have studied the unsupervised acquisition of syntactic structure, while linguists such as Boersma and Hayes (2001), Gold smith (2001), Pater (2008) and Albright and Hayes (2003) are developing probabilistic models of the acquisition of phonology and/or morphology, and Frank et al (2007) experimentally tests the predictions of a Bayesian model of lexical acquisition. $$$$$ If one recasts their experiments in this way, they achieve an accuracy of 44.7% on the Penn treebank, which is higher than choosing a random dependency structure, but lower than simply linking all adjacent words into a left-headed (and right-branching) structure (53.2%).

 $$$$$ In particular, neither model attempts to learn intermediate, recursive categories with no direct connection to surface statistics.
 $$$$$ The tree configurations are shown in figure 4.
 $$$$$ Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the stimulus (Clark, 2001), to use induction systems as a first stage in constructing large treebanks (van Zaanen, 2000), to build better language models (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995), and to examine cognitive issues in language learning (Solan et al., 2003).

We use the standard generative Dependency Model with Valence (Klein and Manning, 2004). $$$$$ But then, given a NOUN NOUN VERB sequence, both nouns will attach to the verb – there is no way that the model can learn that verbs have exactly one subject.

We encode more detailed valence information than Klein and Manning (2004) and condition child generation on parent valence. $$$$$ An important distinction should be drawn between work primarily interested in the weak generative capacity of models, where modeling hierarchical structure is only useful insofar as it leads to improved models over observed structures (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995), and work interested in the strong generative capacity of models, where the unobserved structure itself is evaluated (van Zaanen, 2000; Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002).

The resulting simplified model closely resembles DMV (Klein and Manning, 2004), except that it 1) explicitly generate words x rather than only part of-speech tags s, 2) encodes richer context and valence information, and 3) imposes a Dirichlet prior on the symbol distribution. $$$$$ A huge limitation of both of the above models is that they are incapable of encoding even first-order valence facts.

 $$$$$ Therefore, one can start with uniform rewrites and let the interaction between the data and the model structure break the initial symmetry.
 $$$$$ All systems that we are aware of operate under the assumption that the probability of a dependency structure is the product of the scores of the dependencies (attachments) in that structure.
 $$$$$ This simplifies the notation, math, and the evaluation metric.
 $$$$$ The task of statistically inducing hierarchical syntactic structure over unannotated sentences of natural language has received a great deal of attention (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Brill, 1993; Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994).

 $$$$$ We use the inside-outside algorithm to sum over all lexicalized trees, similar to the situation in section 3.
 $$$$$ It will be important in what follows to see that such a representation is isomorphic (in terms of strong generative capacity) to a restricted form of phrase structure grammar, where the set of terminals and nonterminals is identical, and every rule is of the form X → X Y or X → Y X (Miller, 1999), giving the isomorphic representation of figure 1(a) shown in figure 1(b).1 Depending on the model, part-ofspeech categories may be included in the dependency representation, as shown here, or dependencies may be directly between words.
 $$$$$ Third, as we show below, for languages such as Chinese, which have few function words, and for which the definition of lexical categories is much less clear, dependency structures may be easier to detect.

 $$$$$ Again, if we modify the gold standard so as to make determiners the head of NPs, then this model with distributional tags scores 50.6% on directed and 64.8% on undirected dependency accuracy.
 $$$$$ In particular, if one is given all contiguous subsequences (subspans) from a corpus of sentences, most natural clusters will not represent valid constituents (to the extent that constituency of a non-situated sequence is even a well-formed notion).
 $$$$$ In Klein and Manning (2002), we proposed a constituent-context model (CCM) which solves this problem by building constituency decisions directly into the distributional model, by earmarking a single cluster d for non-constituents.
 $$$$$ We also demonstrate that the combined model works and is robust cross-linguistically, being able to exploit either attachment or distributional regularities that are salient in the data.

Finally, following (Klein and Manning, 2004) we strip out punctuation from the sentences. $$$$$ Models like Paskin (2002) avoid modeling STOP by generating the graph skeleton G first, uniformly at random, then populating the words of s conditioned on G. Previous work (Collins, 1999) has stressed the importance of including termination probabilities, which allows the graph structure to be generated jointly with the terminal words, precisely because it does allow the modeling of required dependents.

In the generative models of section 5, f has the form of a dependency model with valence (Klein and Manning, 2004). $$$$$ It demonstrates that the broad constituent and dependency structure of a language can be recovered quite successfully (individually or, more effectively, jointly) from a very modest amount of training data.

Fortunately, the state of the art in broad-coverage (Lin, 1993) and unsupervised (Klein and Manning, 2004) dependency parsing allows us to treat dependency parsing merely as a preprocessing step. $$$$$ At the “attachment” rewrite for the CCM in (a/b), we assign the quantity: which is the odds ratio of generating the subsequence and context for span hi, ki as a constituent as opposed to a non-constituent.
