 $$$$$ We also demonstrate that the combined model works and is robust cross-linguistically, being able to exploit either attachment or distributional regularities that are salient in the data.
 $$$$$ We then demonstrated how this model could be combined with the previous best constituent-induction model to produce a combination which, in general, substantially outperforms either individual model, on either metric.

As we explain at the end of this section, without this aspect the generative story closely resembles the classic dependency model with valence (DMV) of Klein and Manning (2004). $$$$$ While absolute numbers are hard to compare across corpora, all the systems compared to in Klein and Manning (2002) parsed below a right-branching baseline, while the CCM is substantially above it.

 $$$$$ An important distinction should be drawn between work primarily interested in the weak generative capacity of models, where modeling hierarchical structure is only useful insofar as it leads to improved models over observed structures (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995), and work interested in the strong generative capacity of models, where the unobserved structure itself is evaluated (van Zaanen, 2000; Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002).

Finally, following (Klein and Manning, 2004) we strip out punctuation from the sentences. $$$$$ We make no claims as to the cognitive plausibility of the induction mechanisms we present here; however, the ability of these systems to recover substantial linguistic patterns from surface yields alone does speak to the strength of support for these patterns in the data, and hence undermines arguments based on “the poverty of the stimulus” (Chomsky, 1965).
