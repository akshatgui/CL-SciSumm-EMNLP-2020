The sense annotated corpus required for this task was built using the Open Mind Word Expert system (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002), adapted to Romanian. $$$$$ We propose to organize a task in SENSEVAL-3 where systems will disambiguate words using the corpus created with this system.
The sense annotated corpus required for this task was built using the Open Mind Word Expert system (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002), adapted to Romanian. $$$$$ It is worth mentioning that, unlike previous SENSEVAL evaluations, where multi-word expressions were considered as possible senses for an constituent ambiguous word, we filter these expressions apriori with an automatic tool for collocation extraction.

The use of collaborative contributions from volunteers has been previously shown to be beneficial in the Open Mind Word Expert project (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002). $$$$$ Based on early feedback from both researchers and contributors, a future version of Open Mind Word Expert may allow contributors to specify more than one sense for any word.

Due to the expensive annotation process, only a handful of manually sense-tagged corpora are available. An effort to alleviate the training data bottle neck is the Open Mind Word Expert (OMWE) project (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) to collect sense-tagged data from Internet users. $$$$$ We would like to thank the Open Mind Word Expert contributors who are making all this work possible.

The annotated corpus required for this task was built using the Open Mind Word Expert system (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002), adapted for multilingual annotations. $$$$$ We use a simplified form of active learning with selective sampling, where the instances to be tagged are selected as those instances where there is a disagreement between the labels assigned by two different classifiers.

Finally, in an effort related to the Wikipedia collection process, (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) have implemented the Open Mind Word Expert system for collecting sense annotations from volunteer contributors over the Web. $$$$$ There are 88,058 noun occurrences of which 70,214 are polysemous.

Recent estimations of the inter-annotator agreement when using the WordNet inventory report figures of 72.5% agreement in the preparation of the English all-words test set at Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer,2004) and 67.3% on the Open Mind Word Expert an notation exercise (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002). $$$$$ Open Mind Word Expert pursues the potential of creating a large tagged corpus.
