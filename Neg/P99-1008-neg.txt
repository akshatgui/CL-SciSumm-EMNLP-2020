Berland and Charniak (1999) suggest their work may be useful for building a lexicon or ontology, like WordNet. $$$$$ To put this another way, we want to pick (w, p) pairs that have two properties, p(w p) is high and I to, p is large.

In attribute extraction, typically one must choose between the precise results of rich patterns (involving punctuation and parts-of-speech) applied to small corpora (Berland and Charniak, 1999) and the high-coverage results of superficial patterns applied to web-scale data, e.g. via the Google API (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004). $$$$$ However, this difference proves critical in that pattern D tends to pick up &quot;counting&quot; nouns such as &quot;truckload.&quot; On the basis of this experiment we decided to proceed using only patterns A and B from Table 1.
