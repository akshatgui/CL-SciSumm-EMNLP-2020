In attribute extraction, typically one must choose between the precise results of rich patterns (involving punctuation and parts-of-speech) applied to small corpora (Berland and Charniak, 1999) and the high-coverage results of superficial patterns applied to web-scale data, e.g. via the Google API (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004). $$$$$ Certainly the large number of projects that use WordNet [1] would support this contention.
