Also, despite a critical discussion in the MUC task definition (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000), the ACE scheme continues to treat nominal predicates and appositive phrases as coreferential. $$$$$ For example, one might identify the notion of a referring NP with that of a semantically definite NP in the sense of Barwise and Cooper (1981).3 This would include proper names, extensional definite descriptions, universally quantified NPs, and specifically used indefinites (e.g., a company whose name is withheld), but it would exclude nonspecifically used indefinites such as at least n companies, most computational linguists.

In contrast, they do not fall under the identity relation in OntoNotes, which follows the linguistic understanding of coreference according to which nominal predicates and appositives express properties of an entity rather than refer to a second (coreferent) entity (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000). $$$$$ The authors wish to thank Christy Doran, Renate Henschel, Adam Kilgarriff, Paul Piwek, Massimo Poesio, Richard Power, and four anonymous referees for their comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

Proposals for annotating coreference such as (Hirschman, 1998) have been motivated by work on Information Extraction, hence the notion of coreference used is very difficult to relate to traditional ideas about anaphora (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000). $$$$$ An intermediate approach would be to mark up a core set of referring expressions on the first pass, allowing for further referring expressions to be identified on subsequent passes if this is necessary to resolve coreference.

These arguments give support to van Deemter and Kibble (2000), who argue that it is problematic that the annotation strategy assumed in MUC-6 and MUC-7 goes beyond a mark-up of coreference. $$$$$ As a result, the annotated corpus emerging from MUC is unlikely to be as useful for the computational linguistics research community as one might hope (Criterion 4, see Section 1), the more so because generalization to other domains is bound to make problems worse.

NP coreference is related to the task of anaphora resolution, whose goal is to identify an antecedent for an anaphoric NP (i.e., an NP that depends on another NP, specifically its antecedent, for its interpretation) [see van Deemter and Kibble (2000) for a detailed discussion of the difference between the two tasks]. $$$$$ More precisely, let us assume that ai and a2 are occurrences of noun phrases (NPs) and let us assume that both have a unique referent in the context in which they occur (i.e., their context in the corpus makes them unambiguous).
