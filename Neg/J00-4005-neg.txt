Proposals for annotating coreference such as (Hirschman, 1998) have been motivated by work on Information Extraction, hence the notion of coreference used is very difficult to relate to traditional ideas about anaphora (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000). $$$$$ This figure, which falls markedly short of the 95% required by Criterion 2, does not seem to have improved substantially since (Breck Baldwin, personal communication).

see (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) for some problems with the choices made in MUCCS. $$$$$ Current &quot;coreference&quot; annotation practice, as exemplified by MUC, has overextended itself, mixing elements of genuine coreference with elements of anaphora and predication in unclear and sometimes contradictory ways.
