Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ Sie ist nur aus den Gammastrahlen-Daten abgeleitet, die auf der Erde gemessen werden; daI3 Cygnus X-3 wahrscheirtlich kosmische Strahlung in alle Richtungen aussendet, ist dabei noch nicht beriicksichtigt.
Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ This is derived directly from the material illustrated in Figure 2.
Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ 490-493) provide efficient means of identifying all such sequences and, once identified, the data they provide could be added to the WAT much as we now add the results of morphological analysis.
Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ A pair (a, b) is on the list if a is translated, in whole or in part, by b.

The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ The algorithm appears to converge to the correct sentence alignment in only a few iterations.
The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ Alignment makes possible approaches to partially, or completely, automatic translation based on a large corpus of previous translations that have been deemed acceptable.
The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ This therefore appears as an insertion in the translation.

Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ If p and s are the potential prefix and suffix, respectively, and P(p) and S(s) are the number of words in the text in which they occur as such, the value of the function is kP(p)S(s).
Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ The set 1(1,1), (2,1), (4, 2)} is excluded on the grounds that (1,1 ) and (2,1) overlap in the above sense—the first occurrence of &quot;Hund&quot; is represented twice.
Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ We present an algorithm for aligning texts with their translations that is based only on internal evidence.

Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ Another example is provided by English sentences 19 and 20, which appear in German as sentences 21 and 22.

Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ In applications to economic reports from the Union Bank of Switzerland, the method performs very well on simple alignments (one-to-one, oneto-two), but has at the moment problems with complex matches.
