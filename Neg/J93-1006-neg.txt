Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ This can be intuitively explained by the fact that the similarity of a high-frequency word is based on a pattern made up of a large number of instances.
Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ We present an algorithm for aligning texts with their translations that is based only on internal evidence.
Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ Note that the error rate depends crucially on the kind of &quot;annealing schedule&quot; used: if the thresholds that allow a word pair in the WAT to influence the SAT are lowered too fast, only a few passes are needed, but accuracy deteriorates.
Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ The principal data structures used in the algorithm are the following: Word-Sentence Index (WSI).

The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ Their implementation assumes that each character in one language gives rise to, on average, one character in the other language.'
The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ Recall that the alignment problem derives its interest from the fact that single sentences are sometimes translated as sequences of sentences and conversely.
The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ In the formula used, there are a few reasonable simplifications concerning the nature of the AST; however, a Monte-Carlo simulation that is exactly in accordance with our algorithm confirmed the depicted figure in every essential detail.
The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ The growing interest in the possibility of automatically aligning Large texts is attested to by independent work that has been done on it since the first description of our methods was made available (Kay and Roscheisen 1988).

Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ Die Quelle mu13 jenseits der am weitesten entfernten Wasserstoff-Wolke sein, also weiter als ungefahr 37000 Lichtjahre entfernt, am Rande der Milchstrai3e.
Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ Sentences in the English text and in the German text are identified by numbers on the abscissa and the ordinate respectively.
Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ Their implementation assumes that each character in one language gives rise to, on average, one character in the other language.'

Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ The key to reducing the combinatorial explosion probably lies in using tables of similarities such as those the present algorithm uses to suggest combinations of items that would be worth considering.
Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ Figure 5 shows the true sentence alignment for the first 50 sentences (dots), and how the algorithm discovered them: in the first pass, only a few sentences are set into correspondence (circles); after the second pass (crosses) already almost half of the correspondences are found.
Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ If there are no such numbers, then no associations have been found for it at this stage.
Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ This is simple only if the texts have been previously aligned.
