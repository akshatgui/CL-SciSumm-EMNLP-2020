Usually a lexical chain is obtained in a bottom-up fashion, by taking each candidate word of a text, and finding an appropriate relation offered by a thesaurus as Rodget (Morris and Hirst, 1991) or WordNet (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999). $$$$$ This work was financially assisted by the Government of Ontario, the Department of Computer Science of the University of Toronto, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

The lexical chains of Morris and Hirst (1991) had no such restriction, and frequently nouns, verbs ,adjectives, adverbs, and verbs were joined together in one chain. $$$$$ Even though the chain is a lot shorter in length than the intention, its presence is a clue to the existence of a separate intention in its textual vicinity.

Global context where the semantic measures are employed to derive lexical chains, which are threads of meaning often drawn throughout an en tire text (Morris and Hirst, 1991). $$$$$ Since cohesion is well defined, one might expect that it would be computationally easier to identify, because the identification of ellipsis, reference, substitution, conjunction, and lexical cohesion is a straightforward task for people.

Two words are WordNet-related if their WordNet distance is less than 4 (this is consistent with works on lexical-cohesion, (Morris and Hirst, 1991)). $$$$$ The third component of this theory is the attentional state.
