While words and n-grams had little performance effect for the opinion class, they increased the recall for the fact class around five fold compared to the approach by Wiebe et al (1999). $$$$$ Our subjective category is related to but differs from the statement-opinion category of the Switchboard-DAMSL discourse annotation project (Jurafsky et al., 1997), as well as the gives opinion category of Bale's (1950) model of small-group interaction.

Following (Wiebe et al, 1999), if the primary goal of a sentence is judged as the objective reporting of information, it was labeled as OBJ. $$$$$ In particular, we analyze patterns of agreement to identify systematic disagreements that result from relative bias among judges, because they can potentially be corrected automatically.

According to the coding manual (Wiebe et al, 1999), subjective sentences are those expressing evaluations, opinions, emotions, and speculations. $$$$$ The definitions of the categories in our coding manual are intention-based: &quot;If the primary intention of a sentence is objective presentation of material that is factual to the reporter, the sentence is objective.
According to the coding manual (Wiebe et al, 1999), subjective sentences are those expressing evaluations, opinions, emotions, and speculations. $$$$$ Finally, if we only consider sentences with certainty 2 or 3, the pairwise agreements among M, D, and J all have high Kappa values, 0.87 and over.

One judge annotated all articles in four datasets of the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus (Marcus et al, 1993) (W9-4, W9-10, W9-22, and W9 33, each approximately 160K words) as well as the corpus of Wall Street Journal articles used in (Wiebe et al, 1999) (called WSJ-SE below). $$$$$ To allow for uncertainty in the annotation process, the specific tags used in this work include certainty ratings, ranging from 0, for least certain, to 3, for most certain.

Additionally, it may be possible to refine the classications automatically using methods such as those described in (Wiebe et al, 1999). $$$$$ The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3.3 Also as in step 3, the two-category latent class model produces the most consistent clusters across the data configurations.
