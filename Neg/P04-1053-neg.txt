It also does not need to pre-define the number of the context clusters or pre-specify the similarity threshold for the clusters as Hasegawa et al (2004)'s method. $$$$$ The stop words include symbols and words which occurred under 3 times as infrequent words and those which occurred over 100,000 times as highly frequent words.
It also does not need to pre-define the number of the context clusters or pre-specify the similarity threshold for the clusters as Hasegawa et al (2004)'s method. $$$$$ We assume that pairs of entities occurring in similar context can be clustered and that each pair in a cluster is an instance of the same relation.

 $$$$$ Asymmetric properties caused additional difficulties in the COM-COM domain, because most relations have directions.
 $$$$$ If the norm of the context vector is extremely small due to a lack of content words, the cosine similarity between the vector and others might be unreliable.
 $$$$$ Recall increased until the threshold was almost 0, at which point it fell because the total number of correct pairs in the remaining few big clusters decreased.
