Our work is related to previous work on domain independent unsupervised relation extraction, in particular Sekine (2006), Shinyama and Sekine (2006) and Banko et al (2007). Sekine (2006) introduces On-demand information extraction, which aims at automatically identifying salient patterns and extracting relations based on these patterns. $$$$$ Several unsupervised pattern discovery techniques have been proposed, e.g.

Shinyama and Sekine (2006) apply NER, coreference resolution and parsing to a corpus of newspaper articles to extract two-place relations between NEs. $$$$$ The user types a query / topic description in keywords (for example, “merge” or “merger”).

Shinyama and Sekine (2006) apply NER, coreference resolution and parsing to a corpus of newspaper articles to extract two-place relations between NEs. $$$$$ As it is impossible to evaluate all the data, the evaluation data are selected randomly.

Like Sekine (2006) and Shinyama and Sekine (2006), we concentrate on relations involving NEs, the assumption being that these relations are the potentially interesting ones. $$$$$ It involves trying to cover a wide variety of topics with a large inventory of relations and events.

Romano et al (2006) and Sekine (2006) used syntactic paraphrases to obtain patterns for extracting relations. $$$$$ There exists another strategy to extend the range of IE systems.
Romano et al (2006) and Sekine (2006) used syntactic paraphrases to obtain patterns for extracting relations. $$$$$ In this paper, we proposed “On-demand Information Extraction (ODIE)”.
Romano et al (2006) and Sekine (2006) used syntactic paraphrases to obtain patterns for extracting relations. $$$$$ At present, adapting an Information Extraction system to new topics is an expensive and slow process, requiring some knowledge engineering for each new topic.

This contrasts with Open Information Extraction (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) and On-Demand Information Extraction (Sekine, 2006), which aim to extract large databases of open-ended facts, and with supervised relation extraction, which requires additional supervised data to learn new relations. $$$$$ We propose a new paradigm of Information Extraction which operates 'on demand' in response to a user's query.

For instance, Sudo et al (2003) and Sekine (2006) proposed different methods for automatic IE pattern acquisition for a given domain based on frequent subtree discovery in dependency parse trees. $$$$$ This research was supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract HR0011-06-C-0023 and by the National Science Foundation under Grant IIS-0325657.
For instance, Sudo et al (2003) and Sekine (2006) proposed different methods for automatic IE pattern acquisition for a given domain based on frequent subtree discovery in dependency parse trees. $$$$$ The topics in the “not useful” category are “appeal”, “execute”, “fired”, “pardon”, “release” and “trial”.

To reduce the knowledge engineering burden on the user in constructing and porting an IE system, unsupervised learning has been utilized, e.g. Riloff (1996), Yangarber et al (2000), and Sekine (2006). $$$$$ Our previous study (Sekine and Nobata 03) found that about one third of randomly constructed similar newspaper article clusters are well-suited to be presented in table format, and another one third of the clusters can be acceptably expressed in table format.
