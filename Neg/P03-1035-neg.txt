A Chinese resume C=c1',c2',...,ck' is first tokenized into C= w1,w2,...,wk with a Chinese word segmentation system LSP (Gao et al., 2003). $$$$$ The generative probability of the string given it is a LN would be estimated as P(乌苏里江 |LN) = P(乌|<LN>) P(苏|乌) P(里|苏) P(江|里) P(</LN>|江), where <LN> and </LN> are symbols denoting the beginning and the end of a LN, respectively.
