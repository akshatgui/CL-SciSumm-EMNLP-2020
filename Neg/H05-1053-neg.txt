Recent results on the SPORTS and FINANCE gold standard dataset (Koeling et al 2005) show that domain WSD can achieve accuracy in the 50 60% ballpark when a state-of-the-art algorithm such as Personalized PageRank is paired with a distributional approach (Agirre et al 2009) or with semantic model vectors acquired for many domains (Navigli et al 2011). $$$$$ et al (2004) we use   and obtain our thesaurus using the distributional similarity metric described by Lin (1998).

We also experimented with the gold standard produced by Koeling et al (2005). $$$$$ This fact is exploitedby word sense disambiguation (WSD) sys tems which back off to the predominant sense of a word when contextual clues arenot strong enough.
We also experimented with the gold standard produced by Koeling et al (2005). $$$$$ The results show clearly that using this approach to decide whether to use automatic sense rankings performs much better than always using SemCor rankings.
We also experimented with the gold standard produced by Koeling et al (2005). $$$$$ Previous workin all words WSD has indicated that techniques us ing hand-tagged resources outperform unsupervisedmethods.
We also experimented with the gold standard produced by Koeling et al (2005). $$$$$ In this paper we describe the construction of three sense annotated corpora in different domains for a sample of English words.We apply an existing method for acquiring predominant sense information automatically from raw text, and for our sam ple demonstrate that (1) acquiring suchinformation automatically from a mixeddomain corpus is more accurate than de riving it from SemCor, and (2) acquiringit automatically from text in the same do main as the target domain performs best by a large margin.

We first test the proposed method over the tasks of predominant sense learning and sense distribution induction, using the WordNet-tagged dataset of Koeling et al (2005), which is made up of 3 collections of documents: a domain-neutral corpus (BNC), and two domain-specific corpora (SPORTS and FINANCE). $$$$$ 419 predominant sense of a word from raw text.

We first notice that, despite the coarser-grained senses of Macmillan as compared to WordNet, the upper bound WSD accuracy using Macmillan is comparable to that of the WordNet-based datasets over the balanced BNC, and quite a bit lower than that of the two domain corpora of Koeling et al (2005). $$$$$ There are alsoother words which though not particularly domainsalient, have a different sense distribution to that an ticipated for a balanced corpus.

The relative occurrence of unlisted/unclear senses in the datasets of Koeling et al (2005) is comparable to UKWAC. $$$$$ Accuracy is related to this because there is more data (both training and test) shared between fewer of the senses.
The relative occurrence of unlisted/unclear senses in the datasets of Koeling et al (2005) is comparable to UKWAC. $$$$$ Magnini et al(2002) have shown that information about the do main of a document is very useful for WSD.
