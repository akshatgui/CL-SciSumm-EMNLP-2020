Bos et al (2004) derive semantic interpretations from a wide-coverage categorial grammar. There are several differences between this and RASP-RMRS, but the most important arise from the differences between CCG and RASP. $$$$$ We demonstrate that well-formed semantic representations can be produced for over 97% of the sentences in unseen WSJ text.We believe this is a major step towards wide coverage semantic interpretation, one of the key objectives of the field of NLP.

On the practical side, we have corpora with CCG derivations for each sentence (Hockenmaier and Steed man, 2007), a wide-coverage parser trained on that corpus (Clark and Curran, 2007) and a system for converting CCG derivations into semantic representations (Bos et al, 2004). However, despite being treated as a single unified grammar formalism, each of these authors use variations of CCG which differ primarily on which combinators are included in the grammar and the restrictions that are put on them. $$$$$ This paper shows how to construct semantic representations from the derivations producedby a wide-coverage CCG parser.

One advantage of the CCG parser is that it is able to assign rich structural descriptions to sentences, from a variety of representations ,e.g. CCG derivations, CCG dependency structures, grammatical relations (Carroll et al, 1998), and first-order logical forms (Bos et al, 2004). $$$$$ Unlike the dependency structures returned by the parser itself, these can be used directly for semantic in terpretation.
