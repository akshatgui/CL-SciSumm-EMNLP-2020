Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky,1992): the text planner has access only to information about communicative goals, the dis course context, and semantics, and generates a non-linguistic representation of text structure and content. $$$$$ The structure of the paper is as follows.

This paper addresses the area of text generation known as micro planning [Levelt 1989, Panaget 1994, Huang and Fiedler 1996], or sentence planning [Rambow and Korelsky 1992]. $$$$$ The linguistic component is based on Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel'euk 1988), and is a reimplementation (in Lisp) of Polguere's Prolog implementation of a Meaning-Text model for English (Iordanskaja et al 1988; Iordanskaja et al 1991).

The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory: FoG (Kittredge and Polgu~re, 1991), LFS (Iordanskaja et al, 1992), and JOYCE (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992). $$$$$ Meteer discusses the same problem in McKeown's original TEXT system (Meteer 1990, p.35).

The second approach is natural language generation (NLG), which customarily divides the generation process into three modules (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992): (1) Text Planning, (2) Sentence Planning, and (3) Surface Realization. $$$$$ On a more practical level, modularity in design and implementation can be exploited by parallel processing of independent modules.
