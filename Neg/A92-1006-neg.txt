Following [Rambow and Korelsky, 1992], we call this additional planning task sentence planning (even though some operations may cross sentence boundaries). $$$$$ Joyce covers the whole range of tasks associated with text generation, from content selection to morphological processing.
Following [Rambow and Korelsky, 1992], we call this additional planning task sentence planning (even though some operations may cross sentence boundaries). $$$$$ Not all arguments must be filled by a :make-proposition command; the sentence planner will choose lexical and syntactic realizations accordingly.
Following [Rambow and Korelsky, 1992], we call this additional planning task sentence planning (even though some operations may cross sentence boundaries). $$$$$ In the interest of efficiency, modularity and portability we have decided to represent DCK explicitly in Joyce.

Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky,1992) $$$$$ Classified information enters the Black Box through P6.
Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky,1992) $$$$$ Morphological processing is done by a component closely based on SUTRA-S (Emele and Momma 1985).
Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky,1992) $$$$$ The first question that arises is at what level propositions should be combined.

This paper addresses the area of text generation known as micro planning [Levelt 1989, Panaget 1994, Huang and Fiedler 1996], or sentence planning [Rambow and Korelsky 1992]. $$$$$ The realizer prints out the surface sentence Classified information enters the Black Box through P6.
This paper addresses the area of text generation known as micro planning [Levelt 1989, Panaget 1994, Huang and Fiedler 1996], or sentence planning [Rambow and Korelsky 1992]. $$$$$ The linguistic planning tasks should, however, be clearly separated from the textual planning tasks: while the linguistic planning tasks are languagedependent, the textual planning tasks appear not to be2.
This paper addresses the area of text generation known as micro planning [Levelt 1989, Panaget 1994, Huang and Fiedler 1996], or sentence planning [Rambow and Korelsky 1992]. $$$$$ For example, in the example quoted above, the lexeme data base occurs only once in the conjoined sentence.

The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory $$$$$ Additional information, princi pally about the security level of the components an ports, is entered through menus.
The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory $$$$$ The :title special command generates a title.

The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory $$$$$ II has met the design objectives of speed and quality, and our experience in porting the text generator to new task: and to new applications indicates that Joyce is a flexibl( system that can adapt to a variety of text generatior tasks.

The second approach is natural language generation (NLG), which customarily divides the generation process into three modules (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) $$$$$ Incrementality reduces the initial response time of the system (though not the overall processing time).
The second approach is natural language generation (NLG), which customarily divides the generation process into three modules (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) $$$$$ Morphological processing is done by a component closely based on SUTRA-S (Emele and Momma 1985).
The second approach is natural language generation (NLG), which customarily divides the generation process into three modules (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) $$$$$ Other special commands support conditional branching and iteration.
The second approach is natural language generation (NLG), which customarily divides the generation process into three modules (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) $$$$$ In addition, two further special commands were found to be necessary in order to perform text planning: This type of revision is different from the revision discussed in (Gabriel 1988) and (Meteer 1991).
