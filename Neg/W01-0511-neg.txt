In previous work (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), we demonstrated the utility of using a lexical hierarchy for assigning relations to two-word noun compounds. $$$$$ For example, we want to characterize the treatment-for-disease relationship between the words of migraine treatment versus the method-of-treatment relationship between the words of aerosol treatment.
In previous work (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), we demonstrated the utility of using a lexical hierarchy for assigning relations to two-word noun compounds. $$$$$ In this work we aim for a representation that is intermediate in generality between standard case roles (such as Agent, Patient, Topic, Instrument), and the specificity required for information extraction.

Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ For these experiments, we considered only those noun compounds for which both nouns can be mapped into MeSH terms, resulting in a total of 2245 NCs.
Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ On the other hand, if we look at relations 14 and 15, we find a wider range of words, and in some cases the words in the test set are not present in the training set.
Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ We also included a “wrong” category containing word pairs that were incorrectly labeled as NCs.2 The relations were found by iterative refinement based on looking at 2245 extracted compounds (described in the next section) and finding commonalities among them.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound. $$$$$ We would like to thank Nu Lai for help with the classification of the noun compound relations.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound. $$$$$ In theoretical linguistics, there are contradictory views regarding the semantic properties of noun compounds (NCs).

This includes the seminal paper of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), Senseval and Conll competitions on automatic labeling of semantic roles detection of noun compound semantics (Lapata, 2000), (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) and many others. $$$$$ We find that a very simple approach using a machine learning algorithm and a domain-specific lexical hierarchy successfully generalizes from training instances, performing better on previously unseen words than a baseline consisting of training on the words themselves.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) constructed feature vectors for each noun modifier pair using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) as lexical resources. $$$$$ To create a collection of noun compounds, we performed searches from MedLine, which contains references and abstracts from 4300 biomedical journals.
Rosario and Hearst (2001) constructed feature vectors for each noun modifier pair using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) as lexical resources. $$$$$ The longer the name of the MeSH term, the longer the path from the root and the more precise the description.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) constructed feature vectors for each noun modifier pair using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) as lexical resources. $$$$$ We have shown that a class-based representation performes as well as a lexical-based model despite the reduction of raw information content and despite a somewhat errorful mapping from terms to concepts.

In other methods, lexical resources are specifically tailored to meet the requirements of the domain (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) or the system (Gomez, 1998). $$$$$ We are developing corpus-based techniques for identifying semantic relations at an intermediate level of description (more specific than those used in case frames, but more general than those used in traditional knowledge representation systems).

In other methods, lexical resources are specifically tailored to meet the requirements of the domain (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) or the system (Gomez, 1998). $$$$$ We have also shown that representing the nouns of the compound by a very general representation (Model 2) achieves a reasonable performance of aout 52% accuracy on average.

For example, Rosario and Hearst (2001) propose 18 abstract relations for interpreting NCs in biomedical text, e.g., DEFECT, MATERIAL, PERSON AFFILIATED, ATTRIBUTE OF CLINICAL STUDY. $$$$$ Warren’s classification schema is much more detailed, and there is some overlap between the top levels of Warren’s hierarchy and our set of relations.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) used MeSH, a lexical hierarchy of medical terms. $$$$$ Levi’s classes are too general for our purposes; for example, she collapses the “location” and “time” relationships into one single class “In” and therefore field mouse and autumnal rain belong to the same class.

Domain noun compound semantics, including static relations, have been considered in studies by (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) and (Nakov et al, 2005), but in IE settings static relations tend to appear only implicitly, as in the RelEx causal RE system of (Fundel et al, 2007), or through the causal relations they imply: for example, in the AIMed corpus (Bunescu et al, 2005) statements such as NE1/NE2 complex are annotated as a binding relation between the two NEs, not Part Whole relations with the broader entity. $$$$$ It is interesting to note that the accuracy for Case 1 (first noun not present in the training set) is much higher than the accuracy for Case 2 (second noun not present in the training set).
