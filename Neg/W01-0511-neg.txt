In previous work (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), we demonstrated the utility of using a lexical hierarchy for assigning relations to two-word noun compounds. $$$$$ Warren’s classification schema is much more detailed, and there is some overlap between the top levels of Warren’s hierarchy and our set of relations.
In previous work (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), we demonstrated the utility of using a lexical hierarchy for assigning relations to two-word noun compounds. $$$$$ Additionally, this data set is “dense” in the sense that very few testing words are not present in the training data.

Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ For example, we want to characterize the treatment-for-disease relationship between the words of migraine treatment versus the method-of-treatment relationship between the words of aerosol treatment.
Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ It has been shown that relations of this kind can be combined in order to determine the “directionality” of a sentence (e.g., whether or not a politician is in favor of, or opposed to, a proposal) (Hearst, 1990).
Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ Note that because we are concerned with the semantic relations that hold between the concepts, as opposed to the more standard, syntax-driven computational goal of determining left versus right association, this has the fortuitous effect of changing the problem into one of classification, amenable to standard machine learning classification techniques.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound. $$$$$ Multi-class classification is a difficult problem (Vapnik, 1998).

Rosario and Hearst (2001) constructed feature vectors for each noun modifier pair using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) as lexical resources. $$$$$ For example, we want to characterize the treatment-for-disease relationship between the words of migraine treatment versus the method-of-treatment relationship between the words of aerosol treatment.

This approach was used by Rosario and Hearst (2001) within a specific domain - medical texts. $$$$$ We use the MeSH hierarchy for generalization across classes of nouns; we use it instead of the other resources in the UMLS primarily because of MeSH’s hierarchical structure.
This approach was used by Rosario and Hearst (2001) within a specific domain - medical texts. $$$$$ The current standard formulation is: given a verb followed by a noun and a prepositional phrase, represented by the tuple v, n1, p, n2, determine which of v or n1 the PP consisting of p and n2 attaches to, or is most closely associated with.
