 $$$$$ Traditionally various linguistic levels were used to deal with this problem: syntactic, semantic and pragmatic.
 $$$$$ This kind of mapping usually influences the translation process and is therefore encoded in components of the translation program, either explicitly or implicitly, especially in transfer based systems.
 $$$$$ We concentrate on the problem of target word selection in machine translation, for which the approach is directly applicable, and employ a statistical model for the selection mechanism.

It is well known that two languages are more informative than one (Dagan et al, 1991). $$$$$ For example, in one of these cases the statistics selected the expression 'to begin talks' while the human translator regarded this expression as incorrect and selected 'to start talks'.

However, bilingual parallel corpora have mostly been used for tasks related to word sense disambiguation such as target word selection (Dagan et al, 1991) and separation of senses (Dyvik, 1998). $$$$$ As a result of this process, the Hebrew set contained 105 ambiguous words (which had at least one unacceptable translation) and the German set 54 ambiguous words.
However, bilingual parallel corpora have mostly been used for tasks related to word sense disambiguation such as target word selection (Dagan et al, 1991) and separation of senses (Dyvik, 1998). $$$$$ If this Ba is less than a specified threshold then we do not choose between the alternatives.

For example, Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned Hansard Corpus of Canadian Parhamentary debates for WSD, and Dagan et al (1991) and Dagan and Ital (1994) used monolingual corpora of Hebrew and German and a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ Whereas the noun `hoze' means both 'contract' and 'treaty'.
For example, Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned Hansard Corpus of Canadian Parhamentary debates for WSD, and Dagan et al (1991) and Dagan and Ital (1994) used monolingual corpora of Hebrew and German and a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ The method presented takes advantage of two linguistic phenomena: the different usage of words and word senses among different languages and the importance of lexical cooccurrences within syntactic relations.
For example, Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned Hansard Corpus of Canadian Parhamentary debates for WSD, and Dagan et al (1991) and Dagan and Ital (1994) used monolingual corpora of Hebrew and German and a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ Consulting English corpora of 150 million words, yields the following statistics on single word frequencies: 'sign' appeared 28674 times, 'seal' 2771 times, 'finish' appeared 15595 times, 'close' 38291 times, 'treaty' 7331 times and 'contract' 30757 times.
For example, Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned Hansard Corpus of Canadian Parhamentary debates for WSD, and Dagan et al (1991) and Dagan and Ital (1994) used monolingual corpora of Hebrew and German and a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ For instance, applying the mapping to example (6-c) we get three alternatives for the relation in the target sentence: (8) (verb-obj: achieve progress) (verb-obj: achieve advance) (verb-obj: achieve advancement) For example (6-d) we get 9 alternatives, since both 'II-progress' and 'II-talks' have three alternative translations.
