The fact that observations and prior knowledge are useful for part-of-speech tagging is well understood (Brill, 1995), but the approach of estimating an initial transition model only from unambiguous word pairs is novel. $$$$$ First, a dictionary was created listing all possible tags for each word in the corpus.
The fact that observations and prior knowledge are useful for part-of-speech tagging is well understood (Brill, 1995), but the approach of estimating an initial transition model only from unambiguous word pairs is novel. $$$$$ We compare this algorithm to the Baum-Welch algorithm, used for unsupervised training of stochastic taggers.

The fact that observations and prior knowledge are useful for part-of-speech tagging is well understood (Brill, 1995), but the approach of estimating an initial transition model only from unambiguous word pairs is novel. $$$$$ Almost all of the work in the area of automatically trained taggers has explored Markov-model based part of speech tagging [Jelinek, 1985; Church, 1988; Derose, 1988; DeMarcken, 1990; Cutting et al., 1992; Kupiec, 1992; Charniak et al., 1993; Weischedel et al., 1993; Schutze and Singer, 1994; Lin et al., 1994; Elworthy, 1994; Merialdo, 19951.2 For a Markov-model based tagger, training consists of learning both lexical probabilities (P(worclItag)) and contextual probabilities (P(tagiltagi_i tagi_n)).

In the meantime, (Brill 1995a) (Brill 1995b) proposed a method to acquire context-dependent POS disambiguation rules and created an accurate tagger, even from a very small annotated text by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. $$$$$ In this paper we describe an unsupervised learning algorithm for automatically training a rule-based part of speech tagger without using a manually tagged corpus.

 $$$$$ It is possible to use unsupervised learning to train stochastic taggers without the need for a manually annotated corpus by using the Baum-Welch algorithm [Baum, 1972; Jelinek, 1985; Cutting et al., 1992; Kupiec, 1992; Elworthy, 1994; Merialdo, 19951.
 $$$$$ A tagged corpus can also be used to improve the accuracy of unsupervised transformationbased learning.

Later results (e.g. Brill (1995)) seemed to indicate that other methods of unsupervised learning could be more effective (although the work of Banko and Moore (2004) suggests that the difference may be far less than previously assumed). $$$$$ If no prior knowledge is available, probabilities are initially either assigned randomly or evenly distributed.
Later results (e.g. Brill (1995)) seemed to indicate that other methods of unsupervised learning could be more effective (although the work of Banko and Moore (2004) suggests that the difference may be far less than previously assumed). $$$$$ This algorithm works by iteratively adjusting the lexical and contextual probabilities to increase the overall probability of the training corpus.

Transformation based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) is a machine learning approach for rule learning. $$$$$ A tagged corpus can also be used to improve the accuracy of unsupervised transformationbased learning.
Transformation based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) is a machine learning approach for rule learning. $$$$$ Being a processor, it can be applied to the output of any initial state annotator.
Transformation based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) is a machine learning approach for rule learning. $$$$$ Figure 1 illustrates the learning process.

In its most general setting, the TBL hypothesis is not a classifier (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ In addition, the learned rules can be converted into a deterministic finite state transducer.

(Brill, 1995) uses lexicon for initial annotation of the training corpus, where each word in the lexicon has a set POS tags seen for the word in the training corpus. $$$$$ An example of a learned transformation is: Change the tag of a word from VERB to NOUN if the previous word is a DETERMINER.
(Brill, 1995) uses lexicon for initial annotation of the training corpus, where each word in the lexicon has a set POS tags seen for the word in the training corpus. $$$$$ Next, we show a method for combining unsupervised and supervised rule-based training algorithms to create a highly accurate tagger using only a small amount of manually tagged text.

Brill (1995b) proposed an unsupervised tagger based on transformation based learning (Brill, 1995a), achieving accuracies of above 95%. $$$$$ We describe an algorithm for both unsupervised and weakly supervised training of a rule-based part of speech tagger, and compare the performance of this algorithm to that of the Baum-Welch algorithm.

We will also study the effect of other window sizes and the combination of this unsupervised approach with minimally-supervised approaches such as (Brill 1995) (Smith and Mann 2003). $$$$$ The most accurate stochastic taggers use estimates of lexical and contextual probabilities extracted from large manually annotated corpora (eg.
We will also study the effect of other window sizes and the combination of this unsupervised approach with minimally-supervised approaches such as (Brill 1995) (Smith and Mann 2003). $$$$$ One significant difference between this approach and that taken in using the BaumWelch algorithm is that here the supervision influences the learner after unsupervised training, whereas when using tagged text to bias the initial probabilities for Baum-Welch training, supervision influences the learner prior to unsupervised training.

Research into unsupervised part-of-speech tagging with a tag dictionary (sometimes called weakly supervised POS tagging) has been going on for many years (cf Merialdo (1994), Brill (1995)), but generally using a fairly small tag set. $$$$$ In this paper we describe an unsupervised learning algorithm for automatically training a rule-based part of speech tagger without using a manually tagged corpus.

Research into unsupervised part-of-speech tagging with a tag dictionary (sometimes called weakly supervised POS tagging) has been going on for many years (cf Merialdo (1994), Brill (1995)), but generally using a fairly small tag set. $$$$$ Therefore, if tagged text is needed in training, this would require manually tagging text each time the tagger is to be applied to a new language, and even when being applied to a new type of text.

Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, as defined above, has been attempted using a variety of learning algorithms (Brill 1995, Church, 1988, Cutting et. al. 1992, Elworthy, 1994 Kupiec 1992, Merialdo 1991). $$$$$ Next, we show a method for combining unsupervised and supervised rule-based training algorithms to create a highly accurate tagger using only a small amount of manually tagged text.

For our comparison of unsupervised tagging methods, we implemented the HMM taggers described in Merialdo (1991) and Kupiec (1992), as well as the UTBL tagger described in Brill (1995). $$$$$ One weakness of this rulebased tagger is that no unsupervised training algorithm has been presented for learning rules automatically without a manually annotated corpus.
