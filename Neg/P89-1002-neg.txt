The infinite application of grammar rules is a common problem of the existing top-down unification-based generators (Shieber et al, 1989). $$$$$ Further enhancements to the algorithm are envisioned.
The infinite application of grammar rules is a common problem of the existing top-down unification-based generators (Shieber et al, 1989). $$$$$ In summary, top-down generation algorithms, even if controlled by the instantiation status of goals, can fail to terminate on certain grammars.
The infinite application of grammar rules is a common problem of the existing top-down unification-based generators (Shieber et al, 1989). $$$$$ We present an algorithm for generating strings from logical form encodings that improves upon previous algorithms in that it places fewer restrictions on the class of grammars to which it is applicable.
The infinite application of grammar rules is a common problem of the existing top-down unification-based generators (Shieber et al, 1989). $$$$$ Wedekind (1988) defines completeness and coherence of a generation algorithm as follows.

One of the termination problems Shieber et al (1989) pointed out is in the left-recursive rules. $$$$$ Further enhancements to the algorithm are envisioned.
One of the termination problems Shieber et al (1989) pointed out is in the left-recursive rules. $$$$$ For example, consider a grammar that includes the rule s/S --> np/NP, vp(NP)/S.
One of the termination problems Shieber et al (1989) pointed out is in the left-recursive rules. $$$$$ The use of dynamic programming techniques, as in chart parsing, would be an appropriate augmentation to the implementation of the algorithm.

Though the restriction can not be applied to languages like Dutch (Shieber et al, 1989), the limitation is irrelevant to our purpose (translation between Japanese and English). $$$$$ We would like to thank Mary Dalrymple and Louis des Tombe for their helpful discussions regarding this work.

Though the restriction can not be applied to languages like Dutch (Shieber et al, 1989), the limitation is irrelevant to our purpose (translation between Japanese and English). $$$$$ The recursive connection will use the same chain rule, generating the particle &quot;up&quot;, and the new node to be connected [d].
Though the restriction can not be applied to languages like Dutch (Shieber et al, 1989), the limitation is irrelevant to our purpose (translation between Japanese and English). $$$$$ The enabling design feature of the algorithm is its implicit traversal of the analysis tree for the string being generated in a semantic-head-driven fashion.

The actual realization of the component is based on a constraint-based inheritance algorithm that follows the example of PATR-II (Shieber et al, 1989). $$$$$ Shieber, Moore, and Pereira were supported in this work by a contract with the Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corp. and by a gift from the Systems Development Foundation as part of a coordinated research effort with the Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University; van Noord was supported by the European Community and the Nederlands Bureau voor Bib liotheekwezen en Informatieverzorgin through the Eurotra project.
The actual realization of the component is based on a constraint-based inheritance algorithm that follows the example of PATR-II (Shieber et al, 1989). $$$$$ For example, here is the rule for sentences: s(Form, GO-G, Store)/quant(Q,X,R,S) ---> s(Form, GO-G, [qterm(Q,X,R)IStore])/S.
The actual realization of the component is based on a constraint-based inheritance algorithm that follows the example of PATR-II (Shieber et al, 1989). $$$$$ First, the order of processing is not left-to-right.

The lexicon match is not based on direct unification of the target phrase's semantics with that of its head, a fundamental requirement of the bottom-up head-driven algorithm of Shieber et al (1989) and Van Noord (1990). $$$$$ The verb was generated before any of its complements.
The lexicon match is not based on direct unification of the target phrase's semantics with that of its head, a fundamental requirement of the bottom-up head-driven algorithm of Shieber et al (1989) and Van Noord (1990). $$$$$ Since the NP is not connected in this sense, but the VP is, the latter will be expanded first.
The lexicon match is not based on direct unification of the target phrase's semantics with that of its head, a fundamental requirement of the bottom-up head-driven algorithm of Shieber et al (1989) and Van Noord (1990). $$$$$ Clearly, such a generator may not terminate.
The lexicon match is not based on direct unification of the target phrase's semantics with that of its head, a fundamental requirement of the bottom-up head-driven algorithm of Shieber et al (1989) and Van Noord (1990). $$$$$ A chain rule is applicable to connect a pivot to a root if the pivot can serve as the semantic head of the rule and the left-hand-side of the rule is appropriate for linking to the root.
