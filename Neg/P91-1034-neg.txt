The idea of obtaining linguistic information about a text in one language by exploiting parallel or comparable texts in another language has been explored in the field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) since the early 90's, the most representative works being (Brown et al, 1991), (Gale et al, 1992), and (Dagan and Itai, 1994). $$$$$ This system is an enhanced version of the one described by Brown et al.

As a somewhat radical alternative to taxonomical relationships, other ways of measuring semantic similarity based on distributional evidence have been put forward in the literature (see, among others, Brown et al 1991, Gale et al 1992, Pereira and Tishby 1992), which emphasise the role played by context in this game. $$$$$ In the sentence I think it is a problem, it is best to translate is as est as in Je pense que c'est un ,probleme.

 $$$$$ We call this most probable alignment the Viterbi alignment between E and F. The identity of the Viterbi alignment for a pair of sentences depends on the details of the translation model, but once the model is known, probable alignments can be discovered algorithmically [Brown et al., 1991].
