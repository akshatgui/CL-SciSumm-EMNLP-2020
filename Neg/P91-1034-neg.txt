It has been equally shown that collocations are useful in a range of other applications, such as word sense disambiguation (Brown et al, 1991) and parsing (Alshawi and Carter, 1994). $$$$$ An alluring aspect of the statistical approach to machine translation rejuvenated by Brown et al.

Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992) used the translations of the ambiguous word in a bilingual corpus as sense tags. $$$$$ The question is constructed to have high mutual information with the translation of that instance in another language.
Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992) used the translations of the ambiguous word in a bilingual corpus as sense tags. $$$$$ In a Viterbi alignment, a French word that is connected by a line to an English word is said to be aligned with that English word.
Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992) used the translations of the ambiguous word in a bilingual corpus as sense tags. $$$$$ Let p(e, f) be the probability that a connection chosen at random from this set will connect the English word e to the French word f. Because each French word gives rise to exactly one connection, the right marginal of this distribution is identical to the distribution of French words in these sentences.

Brown et al (1991) proposed a WSD algorithm to disambiguate English translations of French target words based on the single most informative context feature. $$$$$ An instance of a word is assigned a sense by asking a question about the context in which the word appears.
Brown et al (1991) proposed a WSD algorithm to disambiguate English translations of French target words based on the single most informative context feature. $$$$$ Errors such as this are common because the statistical models only capture local phenomena; if the context necessary to determine a translation falls outside the scope of the models, the word is likely to be translated incorrectly.
Brown et al (1991) proposed a WSD algorithm to disambiguate English translations of French target words based on the single most informative context feature. $$$$$ The translation model used by Brown et al. [Brown et al., 1990] incorporates the concept of an alignment in which each word in E acts independently to produce some of the words in F. If we denote a typical alignment by A, then we can write the probability of F given E as a sum over all possible alignments: Although the number of possible alignments is a very rapidly growing function of the lengths of the French and English sentences, only a tiny fraction of the alignments contributes substantially to the sum, and of these few, one makes the greatest contribution.

The idea of obtaining linguistic information about a text in one language by exploiting parallel or comparable texts in another language has been explored in the field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) since the early 90's, the most representative works being (Brown et al, 1991), (Gale et al, 1992), and (Dagan and Itai, 1994). $$$$$ On the other hand, in Il faut que les notres gagnent, which means it is necessary that we win, il should be translated as it.
