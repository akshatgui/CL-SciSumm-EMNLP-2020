A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ The same experiment was repeated for en —* de translation with similar trends, except that the Germanic languages out-scored the Romance languages.
A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ Systems which have used this notion of triangulation typically create several candidate sentential target translations for source sentences via different languages.
A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ Unknown source phrases are substituted by the back-translated paraphrases and translation proceeds on the paraphrases.

In statistical machine translation (SMT), methods that incorporate translations from other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) have proven effective in low-resource situations: when phrase translations are unavailable for a certain language, one can look at other languages where the translation is available and then translate from that language. $$$$$ We present a probabilistic formulation through which we can estimate the desired phrase translation distribution (phrase-table) by marginalisation, p(s|t) _ Ei p(s, i|t).

We call this two-stage translation process triangulation (Kay, 1997).

Pivoting can finally be used to fix or improve the translation model: (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) augments the phrase table for a baseline bilingual system with supplementary phrases obtained by pivoting into a third language. $$$$$ Furthermore, we improve the translation estimates for both seen and unseen phrase-table entries, whereas Callison-Burch et al. concentrate solely on unknown phrases.
Pivoting can finally be used to fix or improve the translation model: (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) augments the phrase table for a baseline bilingual system with supplementary phrases obtained by pivoting into a third language. $$$$$ This is particularly heartening, as it provides a means of translating between the many “low density” language pairs for which we don’t yet have a source-target bitext.
Pivoting can finally be used to fix or improve the translation model: (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) augments the phrase table for a baseline bilingual system with supplementary phrases obtained by pivoting into a third language. $$$$$ Before reporting our results, we briefly discuss the specific choice of model for our experiments.

One of them is often called triangulation and usually refers to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ Here we have used three languages for triangulation (it U {de, en, es, fr}\{s, t}).
One of them is often called triangulation and usually refers to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ So, if a source phrase tends to align with two different target phrases, then we would also expect it to align with two phrases in the ‘intermediate’ language.
One of them is often called triangulation and usually refers to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ However, the phrasal overlap is much greater (10 to 20%), which allows for triangulation using these common phrases.

For instance, (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) explore the use of triangulation for machine translation, where multiple translation models are learned using multilingual parallel corpora. $$$$$ Special thanks to Markus Becker, Chris Callison-Burch, David Talbot and Miles Osborne for their helpful comments.
For instance, (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) explore the use of triangulation for machine translation, where multiple translation models are learned using multilingual parallel corpora. $$$$$ As we explain in the next section, these problems can be ameliorated by using the triangulated phrase-table in conjunction with a standard phrase-table.

This finding might also carry over to phrase-table triangulation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007), where multi-parallel data is used in training to augment a standard translation system. $$$$$ Special thanks to Markus Becker, Chris Callison-Burch, David Talbot and Miles Osborne for their helpful comments.
This finding might also carry over to phrase-table triangulation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007), where multi-parallel data is used in training to augment a standard translation system. $$$$$ This allows the use of a much wider range of parallel corpora for training, and can be combined with a standard phrase-table using conventional smoothing methods.

This finding might also carry over to phrase-table triangulation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007), where multi-parallel data is used in training to augment a standard translation system. $$$$$ For these tasks the standard systems have poor coverage (due in part to the sizeable vocabulary of German phrases) and therefore the gain can be largely explained by the additional coverage afforded by the triangulated phrase-tables.

Cohn and Lapata (2007) explores how to utilize multilingual parallel data (rather than pivot data) to improve translation performance. $$$$$ In general we expect that a wider range of possible translations are found for any source phrase, simply due to the extra layer of indirection.
Cohn and Lapata (2007) explores how to utilize multilingual parallel data (rather than pivot data) to improve translation performance. $$$$$ We have just scratched the surface of the possibilities for the framework discussed here.
Cohn and Lapata (2007) explores how to utilize multilingual parallel data (rather than pivot data) to improve translation performance. $$$$$ In contrast to smoothing, our method alleviates data sparseness by exploring additional multiparallel data rather than adjusting the probabilities of existing data.
