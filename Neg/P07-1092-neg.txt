A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ Our experiments revealed that triangulation benefits from a large set of intermediate languages and that performance is increased when languages of the same family to the source or target are used as intermediates.
A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ This is a consequence of unreliable translation estimates and low coverage over source and target phrases.
A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ The lexical probability is obtained by interpolating a relative frequency estimate on the sourcetarget bitext with estimates from triangulation, in the same manner used for phrase translations in (1) and (2).

One of them is often called triangulation and usually refers to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ This is a consequence of unreliable translation estimates and low coverage over source and target phrases.

One of them is often called triangulation and usually refers to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ This allows the use of a much wider range of parallel corpora for training, and can be combined with a standard phrase-table using conventional smoothing methods.

For instance, (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) explore the use of triangulation for machine translation, where multiple translation models are learned using multilingual parallel corpora. $$$$$ Current phrase-based SMT systems perform poorly when using small training sets.
For instance, (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) explore the use of triangulation for machine translation, where multiple translation models are learned using multilingual parallel corpora. $$$$$ Romance languages (es, it, pt) give the best results, both on their own and when used together with the standard phrase-table (using uniform interpolation); Germanic languages (de, nl, da, sv) are a distant second, with the less related Greek and Finnish the least useful.
For instance, (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) explore the use of triangulation for machine translation, where multiple translation models are learned using multilingual parallel corpora. $$$$$ We now formalise triangulation as a generative probabilistic process operating independently on phrase pairs.

This finding might also carry over to phrase-table triangulation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007), where multi-parallel data is used in training to augment a standard translation system. $$$$$ The idea of using multiple source languages for improving the translation quality of the target language dates back at least to Kay (1997), who observed that ambiguities in translating from one language onto another may be resolved if a translation into some third language is available.
This finding might also carry over to phrase-table triangulation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007), where multi-parallel data is used in training to augment a standard translation system. $$$$$ Experimental results demonstrate BLEU improvements for triangulated models over a standard phrase-based system.

Cohn and Lapata (2007) explores how to utilize multilingual parallel data (rather than pivot data) to improve translation performance. $$$$$ Phrase-table entries are created via multiple source languages without the intermediate step of paraphrase extraction, thereby reducing the exposure to compounding errors.
