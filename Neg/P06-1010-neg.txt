However, several techniques for mining name transliterations from monolingual and comparable corpora have been studied (Pasternack and Roth, 2009), (Goldwasser and Roth, 2008), (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), (Sproat et al, 2006), (Udupa et al,2009b). $$$$$ Indeed, although the performance of the frequency correlation method alone is much worse than that of the phonetic correspondence method, when working on the subset of candidates passing the phonetic filter (i.e., those candidates that have a reasonable phonetic alignment with the English name), it can outperform the phonetic correspondence method.

These include studying the query logs (Brill et al, 2001), unrelated corpora (Rapp, 1999), and comparable corpora (Sproat et al 2006). $$$$$ This propagation method achieves further improvement over the best results from the previous step.

An initial PSM is bootstrapped using limited prior knowledge such as a small amount of transliterations, which may be obtained by exploiting co-occurrence information (Sproat et al, 2006). $$$$$ In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration.

In transliteration extraction, mining translations or transliterations from the ever-growing multilingual Web has become an active research topic, for example, by exploring query logs (Brill et al., 2001) and parallel (Nie et al, 1999) or comparable corpora (Sproat et al, 2006). $$$$$ We also study several variations of the similarity measures.

(Sproat et al 2006) have compared names from comparable and contemporaneous English and Chinese texts, scoring matches by training a learning algorithm to compare the phonemic representations of the names in the pair, in addition to taking into account the frequency distribution of the pair over time. $$$$$ We have further showed that one can improve upon the combined model by using reinforcement via score propagation when transliteration pairs cluster together in document pairs.

For example, (Sproat et al, 2006) presents a supervised system that achieves a MRR score of 0.89, when evaluated over a dataset consisting of 400 English NE and 627 Chinese words. $$$$$ Names of the same entity that occur in different languages often have correlated frequency patterns due to common triggers such as a major event.

(Sproat et al 2006) report an oracle accuracy of 85%, but it depends on the source of the candidate transliterations. $$$$$ In the table, “init.” refers to the initial scores. and “CO” and “MI” stand for best scores obtained using either the co-occurrence or mutual information method.
