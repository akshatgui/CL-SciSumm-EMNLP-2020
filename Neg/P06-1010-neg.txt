In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration; note that (Tao and Zhai, 2005) compares several different metrics for time correlation, as we also note below and see (Sproat et al., 2006). $$$$$ In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration.

However, several techniques for mining name transliterations from monolingual and comparable corpora have been studied (Pasternack and Roth, 2009), (Goldwasser and Roth, 2008), (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), (Sproat et al, 2006), (Udupa et al,2009b). $$$$$ Names of the same persons, locations and so forth — which are often transliterated rather than translated — would be found in comparable stories across the three papers.1 We wish to use this expectation to leverage transliteration, and thus the identification of named entities across languages.

These include studying the query logs (Brill et al, 2001), unrelated corpora (Rapp, 1999), and comparable corpora (Sproat et al 2006). $$$$$ To evaluate the proposed transliteration methods quantitatively, we measure the accuracy of the ranked list by Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), a measure commonly used in information retrieval when there is precisely one correct answer (Kantor and Voorhees, 2000).
These include studying the query logs (Brill et al, 2001), unrelated corpora (Rapp, 1999), and comparable corpora (Sproat et al 2006). $$$$$ The results thus show that the idea of exploiting frequency correlation does work.
These include studying the query logs (Brill et al, 2001), unrelated corpora (Rapp, 1999), and comparable corpora (Sproat et al 2006). $$$$$ Armed with the English and Chinese candidate lists, we then consider the pairing of every English candidate with every Chinese candidate.
These include studying the query logs (Brill et al, 2001), unrelated corpora (Rapp, 1999), and comparable corpora (Sproat et al 2006). $$$$$ We have proposed two methods for transliteration, one that is more traditional and based on phonetic correspondences, and one that is based on word distributions and adopts methods from information retrieval.

An initial PSM is bootstrapped using limited prior knowledge such as a small amount of transliterations, which may be obtained by exploiting co-occurrence information (Sproat et al, 2006). $$$$$ We will demonstrate that this intuition is correct.
An initial PSM is bootstrapped using limited prior knowledge such as a small amount of transliterations, which may be obtained by exploiting co-occurrence information (Sproat et al, 2006). $$$$$ Indeed, intuitively the best candidate is the one that has a good pronunciation alignment as well as a correlated frequency distribution with the English name.

In transliteration extraction, mining translations or transliterations from the ever-growing multilingual Web has become an active research topic, for example, by exploring query logs (Brill et al., 2001) and parallel (Nie et al, 1999) or comparable corpora (Sproat et al, 2006). $$$$$ Mining transliterations from multilingual web pages was studied in (Zhang and Vines, 2004); Our work differs from this work in that we use comparable corpora (in particular, news data) and leverage the time correlation information naturally available in comparable corpora.

(Sproat et al 2006) have compared names from comparable and contemporaneous English and Chinese texts, scoring matches by training a learning algorithm to compare the phonemic representations of the names in the pair, in addition to taking into account the frequency distribution of the pair over time. $$$$$ This work was funded by Dept. of the Interior contract NBCHC040176 (REFLEX).

For example, (Sproat et al, 2006) presents a supervised system that achieves a MRR score of 0.89, when evaluated over a dataset consisting of 400 English NE and 627 Chinese words. $$$$$ This propagation method achieves further improvement over the best results from the previous step.

For example, (Sproat et al, 2006) presents a supervised system that achieves a MRR score of 0.89, when evaluated over a dataset consisting of 400 English NE and 627 Chinese words. $$$$$ Since the correlation coefficient has a maximum value of 1, we normalize the phonetic correspondence score by dividing all scores by the maximum score so that the maximum normalized value is also 1.

(Sproat et al 2006) report an oracle accuracy of 85%, but it depends on the source of the candidate transliterations. $$$$$ For example, for the nameI-A*��wei wei-lian-mu-si, one would like to arrive at the English name V(enus) Williams.
