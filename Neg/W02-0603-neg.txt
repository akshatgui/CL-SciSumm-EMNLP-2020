We previously presented two segmentation algorithms suitable for agglutinative languages (Creutz and Lagus, 2002). $$$$$ The morph M, i.e., the word, is unique, which means that all probabilities P(L|M) are equal to one: e.g., the morph puutaloja is always aligned with the labels PUU + TALO + PL + PTV and no other labels, which yields the probabilities P(PUU | Therefore, part of the corpus should be used as training data, and the rest as test data.

A Poisson distribution can be justified and has been used in order to model the length distribution of word and morph tokens [e.g., (Creutz and Lagus, 2002)], but for morph types we have chosen the gamma distribution, which has a thicker tail. $$$$$ Experiments on both Finnish and English corpora show that the presented methods perform well compared to a current stateof-the-art system.

The search for the optimal model given our input data corresponds closely to the recursive segmentation algorithm presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002). $$$$$ To find out the morph sequence that a word consists of, we look up the chunk that is identical to the word, and trace the split indices recursively until we reach the leafs, which are the morphs.
