The approaches tested were Error Driven Pruning (EDP) (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) and Transformational Based Learning of IOB tagging (TBL) (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). $$$$$ We believe, however, that the base NP finder can be improved further.

Conjunctions are a major source of errors for English chunking as well (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995, Cardie and Pierce, 1998), and we plan to address them in future work. $$$$$ By evaluating on both corpora, we can measure the effect of noun phrase complexity on the treebank approach to base NP identification.

Our implementation of the NP-based QA system uses the Empire noun phrase finder, which is described in detail in Cardie and Pierce (1998). $$$$$ The training phase of the algorithm employs two previously successful techniques: like Charniak's (1996) statistical parser, our initial base NP grammar is read from a &quot;treebank&quot; corpus; then the grammar is improved by selecting rules with high &quot;benefit&quot; scores.
