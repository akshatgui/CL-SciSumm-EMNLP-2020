Izumi et al (2003) and (2004) used error annotated transcripts of Japanese speakers in an interview-based test of spoken English to train a maximum entropy classifier (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to recognize 13 different types of grammatical and lexical errors, including errors involving prepositions. $$$$$ We applied different methods to detecting these two kinds of errors.

For example, (Izumi et al, 2003) reported error rates for English prepositions that were as high as 10% in a Japanese learner corpus. $$$$$ The SST is a face-to-face interview between an examiner and the test-taker.

(Izumi et al., 2003) and (Izumi et al, 2004) used an ME approach to classify different grammatical errors in transcripts of Japanese interviews. $$$$$ Our error tags contained three pieces of information, i.e., the part of speech, the grammatical/lexical system and the corrected form.

(Izumi et al., 2003) and (Izumi et al, 2004) used an ME approach to classify different grammatical errors in transcripts of Japanese interviews. $$$$$ The first was an “omission”-type error, where the necessary word was missing, and an error tag was inserted to interpolate it.

For example, in the Japanese Learners of English corpus (Izumi et al., 2003), errors related to verbs are among the most frequent categories. $$$$$ 4 reveals, 32 pieces of information are referenced to estimate an error category, i.e., the targeted word and the two preceding and following words, their word classes, their root forms, five combinations of these (the targeted word, the one preceding and one following/ the targeted word and the one preceding/ the targeted word and the one following/ the targeted word and the two preceding/ the targeted word and the two following), and the first and last letters of the word.
For example, in the Japanese Learners of English corpus (Izumi et al., 2003), errors related to verbs are among the most frequent categories. $$$$$ Method D was used if N error categories came up and we chose an appropriate one for the word from among 2N+1 categories.

A maximum entropy model, using lexical and POS features, is trained in (Izumi et al, 2003) to recognize a variety of errors. $$$$$ The over-riding principle in ME is that when nothing is known, the distribution should be as uniform as possible, i.e., maximum entropy.
A maximum entropy model, using lexical and POS features, is trained in (Izumi et al, 2003) to recognize a variety of errors. $$$$$ We also added the interviewers’ utterances in the entire corpus data (totaling 1202 files, excluding 6 that were used as the test data) to the training data as correct sentences.

Izumi et al (2003) consider several error types, including article and preposition mistakes, made by Japanese learners of English, and Nagata et al (2006) focus on the errors in mass/count noun distinctions with an application to detecting article mistakes also made by Japanese speakers. $$$$$ In this paper, we explained how errors in learners’ spoken data could be detected and in the experiment, using the corpus as it was, the recall rate was about 30% and the precision rate was about 50%.

The usage of articles has been found to be the most frequent error class in the JLE corpus (Izumi et al, 2003). $$$$$ This paper describes a method of detecting grammatical and lexical errors made by Japanese learners of English and other techniques that improve the accuracy of error detection with a limited amount of training data.

In the future, we would like to search for more salient features through a careful study of non-native errors, using error-tagged corpora such as (Izumi et al., 2003). $$$$$ We then determined how we could improve the results by adding the artificially made errors to the training data.

 $$$$$ We did this with the 50 items of training data to extract the correct sentences and then added them to the training data.
 $$$$$ We designed an original error tagset for learners’ grammatical and lexical errors, which were relatively easy to categorize.
 $$$$$ Since some more detailed context might be necessary to decide whether “a” or “the” must be used, the features we used here might be insufficient.

We based our error annotation scheme on that used in the NICT JLE corpus (Izumi et al, 2003a), whose detailed description is readily available, for example, in Izumi et al (2005). $$$$$ In this paper, we explained how errors in learners’ spoken data could be detected and in the experiment, using the corpus as it was, the recall rate was about 30% and the precision rate was about 50%.

 $$$$$ There were some error categories that could not be detected because of the lack of training data, but we have obtained the following results for article errors which occurred most frequently.
 $$$$$ All the interviews are audio-recorded, and judged by two or three raters based on an SST evaluation scheme (SST levels 1 to 9).

The method (Izumi et al, 2003) aims to detect omission-type and replacement-type errors and transformation-based leaning is employed in (Shi and Zhou, 2005) to learn rules to detect errors for speech recognition outputs. $$$$$ There were no improvements for replacementtype errors.
