Finally, there has been recent work on applying unsupervised multilingual learning to morphological segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008). $$$$$ We also provided some evidence that considering closely related languages may be more beneficial than distant pairs if the model is able to explicitly represent shared language structure (the characterto-character phonetic correspondences in our case).

 $$$$$ We notice that in general, adding English – which has comparatively little morphological ambiguity – is about as useful as adding a more closely related Semitic language.
 $$$$$ We also need to marginalize over all possible draws of the distributions A, E, and F from their respective Dirichlet process priors.
 $$$$$ Table 1 shows the performance of the various automatic segmentation methods.
 $$$$$ In which scenario will multilingual learning be most effective?

(Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) use multilingual data to compute segmentations of Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English. $$$$$ We present a nonparametric Bayesian model that jointly induces morpheme segmentations of each language under consideration and at the same time identifies cross-lingual morpheme pator We apply our model to three Semitic languages: Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, as well as to English.

Snyder and Barzilay (2008a; 2008b) consider learning morphological segmentation with non parametric Bayesian model from multilingual data. $$$$$ In the future, we hope to apply similar multilingual models to other core unsupervised analysis tasks, including part-of-speech tagging and grammar induction, and to further investigate the role that language relatedness plays in such models.

 $$$$$ On the other hand, in Arabic, the most common corresponding particle is fy, which appears as a separate word.
