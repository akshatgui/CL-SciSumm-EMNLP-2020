Finally, there has been recent work on applying unsupervised multilingual learning to morphological segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008). $$$$$ For example, the English word misunderstanding would be segmented into mis understand - ing.

 $$$$$ However, if some variables can be jointly sampled, then it may be beneficial to perform block sampling of these variables to speed convergence.
 $$$$$ Morpheme Definition For the purpose of these experiments, we define morphemes to include conjunctions, prepositional and pronominal affixes, plural and dual suffixes, particles, definite articles, and roots.
 $$$$$ This restriction allows us to simulate future performance on purely monolingual data.

(Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) use multilingual data to compute segmentations of Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English. $$$$$ However, when common structures such as phonetic correspondences are explicitly modeled, related languages provide the most benefit.
(Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) use multilingual data to compute segmentations of Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English. $$$$$ The model presented in this paper automatically induces a segmentation and morpheme alignment from a multilingual corpus of short parallel phrases.1 For example, given parallel phrases meaning in my land in English, Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, we wish to segment and align morphemes as follows:
(Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) use multilingual data to compute segmentations of Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English. $$$$$ Thus the identity of the drawn morphemes can be retained even while resampling their generation mechanism. we use the Van Dyke Arabic translation,4 Targum Onkelos,5 and the Revised Standard Version (Nelson, 1952), respectively.
(Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) use multilingual data to compute segmentations of Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English. $$$$$ Will it be for related languages, which share a common core of linguistic features, or for distant languages, whose linguistic divergence can provide strong sources of disambiguation?

Snyder and Barzilay (2008) uses a set of aligned phrases across related languages to learn how to segment words with a Bayesian model and is otherwise fully unsupervised. $$$$$ For centuries, the deep connection between languages has brought about major discoveries about human communication.

The very interesting study by Snyder and Barzilay (2008) on multilingual approaches to morphological segmentation was difficult to classify. $$$$$ Distributions drawn from a Dirichlet process nevertheless produce sparse representations with most probability mass concentrated on a small number of observed and predicted patterns.

Snyder and Barzilay (2008a; 2008b) consider learning morphological segmentation with non parametric Bayesian model from multilingual data. $$$$$ We notice that in general, adding English – which has comparatively little morphological ambiguity – is about as useful as adding a more closely related Semitic language.

 $$$$$ Most of this research assumes that one language has annotations for the task of interest.
 $$$$$ Given a parallel corpus, the annotations are projected from this source language to its counterpart, and the resulting annotations are used for supervised training in the target language.
 $$$$$ Our results demonstrate that learning morphological models in tandem reduces error by up to 24% relative to monolingual models.
 $$$$$ Furthermore, we provide evidence that our joint model achieves better performance when applied to languages from the same family.

Snyder and Barzilay (2008) study the task of unsupervised morphological segmentation of multiple languages. $$$$$ We also provided some evidence that considering closely related languages may be more beneficial than distant pairs if the model is able to explicitly represent shared language structure (the characterto-character phonetic correspondences in our case).

For a majority of our testing we borrow the parallel phrases corpus used in previous work (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), which we refer to as S&B. $$$$$ The study of this connection has made possible major discoveries about human communication: it has revealed the evolution of languages, facilitated the reconstruction of proto-languages, and led to understanding language universals.
For a majority of our testing we borrow the parallel phrases corpus used in previous work (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), which we refer to as S&B. $$$$$ To assess the probability of a potential morpheme set, we need to marginalize over all possible alignments (i.e. possible abstract morpheme pairings and stray morpheme assignments).

 $$$$$ In the following section, we describe a model that can model both generic cross-lingual patterns (fy and b-), as well as cognates between related languages (ktb for Hebrew and Arabic).
 $$$$$ Before performing any experiments, a manual inspection of the generated parallel phrases revealed that many infrequent phrase pairs occurred merely as a result of noisy translation and alignment.
