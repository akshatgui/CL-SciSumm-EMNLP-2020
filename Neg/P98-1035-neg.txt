This marraige of models has been tested in other fields such as speech recognition (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) with success. $$$$$ The intuition behind this procedure is that 0(W, T(k)) is an approximation to the P(T(k)/W) probability which places all its mass on the parses that survived the parsing process; the above procedure simply accumulates the expected values of the counts Om) (y(m) , x(m)) under the 0(W, T(k)) conditional distribution.

Aware that the n-gram obscures many linguistically-signi cant distinctions (Chomsky, 1956, section 2.3), many speech researchers (Jelinek and Laerty, 1991) sought to incorporate hierarchical phrase structure into language modeling (see (Stolcke, 1997)) although it was not until the late 1990s that such models were able to signi cantly improve on 3-grams (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998). $$$$$ Consider predicting the word after in the sentence: the contract ended with a loss of 7 cents after trading as low as 89 cents.

The language model described by Chelba and Jelinek (1998) similarly conditions on linguistically relevant words by assigning partial phrase structure to the history and percolating headwords. $$$$$ The authors would like to thank Sanjeev Khudanpur for his insightful suggestions.
The language model described by Chelba and Jelinek (1998) similarly conditions on linguistically relevant words by assigning partial phrase structure to the history and percolating headwords. $$$$$ The model we present is closely related to the one investigated in (Chelba et al., 1997), however different in a few important aspects: • our model operates in a left-to-right manner, allowing the decoding of word lattices, as opposed to the one referred to previously, where only whole sentences could be processed, thus reducing its applicability to n-best list re-scoring; the syntactic structure is developed as a model component; • our model is a factored version of the one in (Chelba et al., 1997), thus enabling the calculation of the joint probability of words and parse structure; this was not possible in the previous case due to the huge computational complexity of the model.

In this situation, a structured language model (SLM) was proposed by Chelba and Jelinek (1998). $$$$$ The large difference between the perplexity of our model calculated on the &quot;development&quot; set — used for model parameter estimation — and &quot;test&quot; set — unseen data — shows that the initial point we choose for the parameter values has already captured a lot of information from the training data.

 $$$$$ Consequently, certain PARSER and WORD-PREDICTOR probabilities must be given specific values: P((adjoin-right, TOP')/WkTk) = 1, if h_O = (</s>, TOP') and h_{-1}. word 0 <s> ensure that the parse generated by our model is consistent with the definition of a complete parse; The word-predictor model (2) predicts the next word based on the preceding 2 exposed heads, thus making the following equivalence classification: After experimenting with several equivalence classifications of the word-parse prefix for the tagger model, the conditioning part of model (3) was reduced to using the word to be tagged and the tags of the two most recent exposed heads: Model (4) assigns probability to different parses of the word k-prefix by chaining the elementary operations described above.

In the first type, probability of a word is decided based on a parse-tree information like grammatical headwords in a sentence (Charniak, 2001) (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998), or based on part of-speech (POS) tag information (Galescu and Ringger, 1999). $$$$$ The headword of a phrase is the word that best represents the phrase, all the other words in the phrase being modifiers of the headword.
