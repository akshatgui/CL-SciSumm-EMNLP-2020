Aware that the n-gram obscures many linguistically-signi cant distinctions (Chomsky, 1956, section 2.3), many speech researchers (Jelinek and Laerty, 1991) sought to incorporate hierarchical phrase structure into language modeling (see (Stolcke, 1997)) although it was not until the late 1990s that such models were able to signi cantly improve on 3-grams (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998). $$$$$ This research has been funded by the NSF IRI-19618874 grant (STIMULATE).

The language model described by Chelba and Jelinek (1998) similarly conditions on linguistically relevant words by assigning partial phrase structure to the history and percolating headwords. $$$$$ Consider predicting the word after in the sentence: the contract ended with a loss of 7 cents after trading as low as 89 cents.

Y,2 , where Z, Yr, are nonterminal labels or POStags (only for Yi) — is identified to be k, we binarize the constituent as follows: depending on the Z identity, a fixed rule is used to decide which of the two binarization schemes in Figure 8 to apply.

Chelba and Jelinek (1998) proposed that syntactic structure could be used as an alternative technique in language modeling. $$$$$ The equivalence classification of the WkTk word-parse we used for the parser model (4) was the same as the one used in (Collins, 1996): It is worth noting that if the binary branching structure developed by the parser were always rightbranching and we mapped the POStag and nonterminal label vocabularies to a single type then our model would be equivalent to a trigram language model.

In the first type, probability of a word is decided based on a parse-tree information like grammatical headwords in a sentence (Charniak, 2001) (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998), or based on part of-speech (POS) tag information (Galescu and Ringger, 1999). $$$$$ The paper presents a language model that develops syntactic structure and uses it to extract meaningful information from the word history, thus enabling the use of long distance dependencies.
