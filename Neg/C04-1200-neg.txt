The system of Kim and Hovy (2004) tackles orientation detection by attributing, to each term, a positivity score and a negativity score; interestingly, terms may thus be deemed to have both a positive and a negative correlation, maybe with different degrees, and some terms may be deemed to carry a stronger positive (or negative) orientation than others. $$$$$ We computed both positive and negative sentiment strengths for each word and compared their relative magnitudes.
