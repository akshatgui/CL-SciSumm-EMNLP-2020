After establishing a correspondence b tween attribute and unification grammar (UG), we may see that the technique of 'restrictions'; used by Shieber (1985) in his extended algorithm is related to finite partitioning on attribute domains, in fact a particular case which takes advantage of the more structured attribute domains of UG. $$$$$ An item of the form [h, i, A — ct./3, DI designates an edge in the chart from vertex h to i with dotted rule .4 — a-3 and dag D. The chart is initialized with an edge [0,0, X0 — .a, DI for each rule (X0 a, D) where D((X0 eat)) = S. For each vertex i do the following steps until no more items can be added: Predictor step: For each item ending at i of the formi [h, i, X0 a.X;3, DI and each rule of the form (X0 — -I, E) such that E((Xo cat)) = D((X; cat)), add an edge of the form e, X0 — El if this edge is not subsumed by another edge.
