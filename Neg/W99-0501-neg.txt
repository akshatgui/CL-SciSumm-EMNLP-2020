Harabagiu et al (1999) proposed a scheme for attaching sense tags to predicates within the framework of transforming WordNet glosses into a logical form. $$$$$ The implementation of LFTs relies on information provided by Table 2 illusttates the tiansfot mations for the gloss of {tennis, lawn tennis}






In parallel, efforts have been made to enrich WordNet by adding information in glosses (Harabagiu et al, 1999). $$$$$ Our extension of WordNet intends to serve as a lexico-semantic resource for a variety of NLP applications, many of them requiring pragmatic and common-sense knowledge (Harabagm and Moldovan 1998) It is beneficial to transform the conceptual glosses in logical formulae Approach to implement Logical Form Transformations (LFTs) (1) Traditional lexicographic principles determine the discrimination of any conceptual definitions into a genus and the differentia Our LFTs implement the same distinction by always placing the genus predicate on the first position of the LFT, and the rest of the LFT viewed as the definition differentia In the case when the subject or the object are present in the gloss, they share the corresponding arguments with the action/state/event predicate For example, the LFT of (a person who backs a politician) the gloss of {supporter, protagonist, champion, admirer, booster, friend} is LFT = [person n#1(2,1) Sz back v#1(e1,114)) politician n#2(x2) (4) The role of complements within a phrase is replicated in the LFTs Predicates geneiated from modifiers share the same arguments with the predicates corresponding to the phrase heads Adjective piedicates share the same argument as the predicate corresponding to the noun they modify An exemplification is the LFT of the gloss of {art if act , artefact}, which maps (a man-made object) into [ object n#1(xi) Sc man-made a#1(x1)] Similarly, the argument of adverbial predicate is the argument marking the eventuality of the event/state/action they modify For example, the gloss of the verb synset {hare} is (run quickly), producing the LFT = [run(ei,a,i,x2) & quickly(e&quot;)] under the same syntactic role (e g subject, object or prepositional object) By convention, conjunctionpredicates have a variable number of arguments, since they cover a variable number of predicates The first argument represents the &quot;result&quot; of the logical operation induced by the conjunction (e g a logical and in the case of the and conjunction, or a logical or in the case of the or conjunction) The rest of the aiguments indicate the predicates covered by the conjunction, as they are aiguments of those predicates as well (6) We also geneiate 'medicates for every preposition encountered in the gloss The preposition predicates always have two arguments the first argument corresponding to the predicate of the head of the phi ase to which prepositional phi ase is attached, whereas the second argument corresponds to the prepositional object Sources of information.
