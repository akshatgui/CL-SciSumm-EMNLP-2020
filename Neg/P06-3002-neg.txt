 $$$$$ Unlike in current state-of-the-art approaches, the kind and number of different tags is generated by the method itself.
 $$$$$ The approach is evaluated on three different languages by measuring agreement with existing taggers.
 $$$$$ To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leave the decision on tag granularity to the tagger.
 $$$$$ Only words with a frequency rank higher than 2,000 are taken into account.

In Biemann (2006b), the tagger output was directly compared to supervised taggers for English, German and Finnish via information-theoretic measures. $$$$$ An unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) tagging system that relies on graph clustering methods is described.

Nevertheless, many of the practically useful spell checkers incorporate context information and the current analysis on SpellNet can be extended for such spell-checkers by conceptualizing a network of words that capture the word co-occurrence patterns (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ Words like these are called out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
Nevertheless, many of the practically useful spell checkers incorporate context information and the current analysis on SpellNet can be extended for such spell-checkers by conceptualizing a network of words that capture the word co-occurrence patterns (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ A remedy would be to evaluate on hand-tagged data.

 $$$$$ The objective is to minimize the total PP.
 $$$$$ In this way it was possbile to arrive at a one-size-fits-all configuration that allows the parameter-free unsupervised tagging of large corpora.
 $$$$$ In a first stage, we employ a clustering algorithm on distributional similarity, which groups a subset of the most frequent 10,000 words of a corpus into several hundred clusters (partitioning 1).
 $$$$$ To put our results in perspective, we computed the following baselines on random samples of the same 1000 randomly chosen sentences that we used for evaluation: Table 2 summarizes the baselines.

Previous graph-theoretic work (Biemann, 2006) uses order 1 representations. $$$$$ To really judge the benefit of an unsupervised tagging system, it should be evaluated in an application-based way.
Previous graph-theoretic work (Biemann, 2006) uses order 1 representations. $$$$$ Although we use 4-word context windows and the top frequency words as features (as in Schütze 1995), we transform the cosine similarity values between the vectors of our target words into a graph representation.
Previous graph-theoretic work (Biemann, 2006) uses order 1 representations. $$$$$ The morphology extension (M) always improves the OOV scores.

In order to test the argument above, and as an attempt to improve the results from the previous experiment, POS-tags were induced using Biemann's unsupervised POS-tagger (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ The last term of the product, namely P(ci|ti), is dependent on the lexicon3.

Additionally, we used an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger (see (Biemann, 2006)) to tag the NEGRA corpus to be able to present a complete unsupervised parsing process relying on word strings only. $$$$$ The system is not very sensitive to parameter changes: the number of feature words, the frequency cutoffs, the log-likelihood threshold and all other parameters did not change overall performance considerably when altered in reasonable limits.

Mintz (2003) only uses the most frequent 45 frames and Biemann (2006) clusters the most frequent 10,000 words using contexts formed from the most frequent 150-200 words. $$$$$ Further, outliers are handled naturally in that framework, as they are represented as singleton nodes (without edges) and can be excluded from the clustering.

 $$$$$ Ideally, the application should tell us the granularity of our tagger: e.g. semantic class learners could greatly benefit from the high-granular word sets arising in both of our partitionings, which we endeavoured to lump into a coarser tagset here.
 $$$$$ Adopting a standard POS-tagging framework, we maximize the probability of the joint occurrence of tokens (ti) and categories (ci) for a sequence of length n: The transition probability P(ci|ci-1,ci-2) is estimated from word trigrams in the corpus whose elements are all present in our lexicon.

 $$$$$ We compare our results to (Freitag, 2004), as most other works use different evaluation techniques that are only indirectly measuring what we try to optimize here.

 $$$$$ For computing partitioning 2, an efficient algorithm like CW is crucial: the graphs 2 This might even be desired, e.g. for English not. as used for the experiments consisted of 52,857/691,241 (English), 85,827/702,349 (Finnish) and 137,951/1,493,571 (German) nodes/edges.

 $$$$$ The method employed here follows the coarse methodology as described in the introduction, but differs from other works in several respects.
 $$$$$ We will describe an alternative needing much less human intervention.
 $$$$$ Regarding syntactic ambiguity, most approaches do not deal with this issue while clustering, but try to resolve ambiguities at the later tagging stage.

Perhaps due to the overly simplistic methods employed to compute morphological information, morphology has only been used as what Biemann (2006) called add-on's in existing POS induction algorithms, which remain primarily distributional in nature. $$$$$ The procedure to construct the graphs is faster than the method used for partitioning 1, as only words that share at least one neighbour have to be compared and therefore can handle more words with reasonable computing time.
