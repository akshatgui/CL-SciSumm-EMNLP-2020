In order to test the argument above, and as an attempt to improve the results from the previous experiment, POS-tags were induced using Biemann's unsupervised POS-tagger (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ Unlike in current state-of-the-art approaches, the kind and number of different tags is generated by the method itself.
In order to test the argument above, and as an attempt to improve the results from the previous experiment, POS-tags were induced using Biemann's unsupervised POS-tagger (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ Morphologically motivated add-ons are used e.g. in (Clark, 2003) and (Freitag 2004) to guess a more appropriate category distribution based on a wordâ€™s suffix or its capitalization for OOV words.

 $$$$$ We presented a graph-based approach to unsupervised POS tagging.
 $$$$$ As there are as many different word class schemes as tag sets, and the exact amount of word classes is not agreed upon intra- and interlingually, inputting the number of desired clusters beforehand is clearly a drawback.

 $$$$$ We compute and merge two partitionings of word graphs: one based on context similarity of high frequency words, another on log-likelihood statistics for words of lower frequencies.
 $$$$$ Clusters that are not included in the graph of clusters are treated differently, depending on their origin: clusters of partition 1 are added to the result, as they are believed to contain important closed word class groups.
 $$$$$ The last term of the product, namely P(ci|ti), is dependent on the lexicon3.

Perhaps due to the overly simplistic methods employed to compute morphological information, morphology has only been used as what Biemann (2006) called add-on's in existing POS induction algorithms, which remain primarily distributional in nature. $$$$$ The system is not very sensitive to parameter changes: the number of feature words, the frequency cutoffs, the log-likelihood threshold and all other parameters did not change overall performance considerably when altered in reasonable limits.
