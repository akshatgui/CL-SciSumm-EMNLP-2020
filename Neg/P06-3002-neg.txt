In order to test the argument above, and as an attempt to improve the results from the previous experiment, POS-tags were induced using Biemann's unsupervised POS-tagger (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ Unlike in current state-of-the-art approaches, the kind and number of different tags is generated by the method itself.

 $$$$$ We presented a graph-based approach to unsupervised POS tagging.
 $$$$$ As there are as many different word class schemes as tag sets, and the exact amount of word classes is not agreed upon intra- and interlingually, inputting the number of desired clusters beforehand is clearly a drawback.

 $$$$$ We compute and merge two partitionings of word graphs: one based on context similarity of high frequency words, another on log-likelihood statistics for words of lower frequencies.
 $$$$$ Clusters that are not included in the graph of clusters are treated differently, depending on their origin: clusters of partition 1 are added to the result, as they are believed to contain important closed word class groups.
 $$$$$ The last term of the product, namely P(ci|ti), is dependent on the lexicon3.

Perhaps due to the overly simplistic methods employed to compute morphological information, morphology has only been used as what Biemann (2006) called add-on's in existing POS induction algorithms, which remain primarily distributional in nature. $$$$$ The system is not very sensitive to parameter changes: the number of feature words, the frequency cutoffs, the log-likelihood threshold and all other parameters did not change overall performance considerably when altered in reasonable limits.
