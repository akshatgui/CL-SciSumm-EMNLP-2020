Karttunen (1984) provides examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful. $$$$$ Features, in this sense of the word, are usually thought of as attribute-value pairs: [person: 1st], [number: sg], although singleton features are also admitted in some theories.
Karttunen (1984) provides examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful. $$$$$ The values of phonological and morphological features are traditionally atomic; e.g.
Karttunen (1984) provides examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful. $$$$$ When negative constraints are counted in, 1st person is the most and 3rd person the least marked member of the three.

One example of the gap between description and computational implementation is disjunctive feature representation, which became popular in feature-based grammar formalisms in the 1980s (Karttunen, 1984). $$$$$ Another way to represent feature matrices is to think of them as directed graphs where values correspond to nodes and attributes to vectors: In a case like this, the values of the two paths have been &quot;unified.&quot; To represent unification in terms of feature matrices we need to introduce some new convention to distinguish between identity and mere likeness.
One example of the gap between description and computational implementation is disjunctive feature representation, which became popular in feature-based grammar formalisms in the 1980s (Karttunen, 1984). $$$$$ If graphs A and B contain the same attribute but have incompatible values for it, they cannot be unified.
One example of the gap between description and computational implementation is disjunctive feature representation, which became popular in feature-based grammar formalisms in the 1980s (Karttunen, 1984). $$$$$ When it fails, no result. is produced and the operands remain unchanged; when it succeeds, the operands are permanently altered in the process.

The feature structure (adopted from Karttunen, 1984, p. 30) represents disjunctions by enclosing the alternatives in curly brackets ({}). $$$$$ If A and B are compatible, then (Unify A B) contains every attribute that appears only in A or only in B with the value it has there.
The feature structure (adopted from Karttunen, 1984, p. 30) represents disjunctions by enclosing the alternatives in curly brackets ({}). $$$$$ The result of unifying three or more graphs in pairs with one another does not depend on the order in which the operations are performed.
The feature structure (adopted from Karttunen, 1984, p. 30) represents disjunctions by enclosing the alternatives in curly brackets ({}). $$$$$ This is not possible when the noun is overtly marked for number, as in the case of &quot;des Professors&quot; (gen sg) and &quot;der Professoren&quot; (gen pl): *der Antrag des oder der Professors *der Antrag des oder der Professoren the petition of the professor or professors In the light of such cases, it seems reasonable to assume that there is a single form, &quot;Dozenten,&quot; which has a disjunctive feature specification, instead of postulating several fully specified, homonymous lexical entries.
The feature structure (adopted from Karttunen, 1984, p. 30) represents disjunctions by enclosing the alternatives in curly brackets ({}). $$$$$ One can actually use the feature system for certain kind of inferencing.
