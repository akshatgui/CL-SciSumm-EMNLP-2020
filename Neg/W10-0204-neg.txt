Since we were additionally interested in determining colour signatures for emotions (Section 7), we chose to annotate all of the 10,170 word-sense pairs that Mohammad and Turney (2010) used to create their word emotion lexicon. $$$$$ These emotions— joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise— are a subset of the eight proposed in Plutchik (1980).

For example, Mohammad and Turney (2010) study the affects words can evoke in people's minds, while Bollen et al (2011) study various moods ,e.g., tension, depression, beyond simple dichotomy of positive and negative sentiment. $$$$$ Words may evoke different emotions in different contexts, and the emotion evoked by a phrase or a sentence is not simply the sum of emotions conveyed by the words in it, but the emotion lexicon will be a useful component for any sophisticated emotion detecting algorithm.
For example, Mohammad and Turney (2010) study the affects words can evoke in people's minds, while Bollen et al (2011) study various moods ,e.g., tension, depression, beyond simple dichotomy of positive and negative sentiment. $$$$$ Natural symmetry apart, we believe that prior work on automatically computing word–pair antonymy (Lin et al., 2003; Mohammad et al., 2008; Lobanova et al., 2010) can now be leveraged in automatic emotion detection.

 $$$$$ Therefore an emotion lexicon—a list of emotions and words that are indicative of each emotion—is likely to be useful in identifying emotions in text.
 $$$$$ Lastly, we chose all words from each of the six emotion categories in the WordNet Affect Lexicon that had at most two senses in the thesaurus (occurred in at most two thesaurus categories).
 $$$$$ For a given term– emotion pair, the majority class is that intensity level that is chosen most often by the Turkers to represent the degree of emotion evoked by the word.

In this work, we make this transition more explicit and intentional, by introducing a novel connotation lexicon. Mohammad and Turney (2010) focussed on emotion evoked by common words and phrases. $$$$$ Thanks to Norm Vinson and the Ethics Committee at NRC for examining, guiding, and approving the survey.

Two main differences are $$$$$ Much of this recent work focuses on six emotions studied by Ekman (1992).

For instance, our co-occurrence method is an adaption of a technique applied in sentiment analysis (Turney and Littman, 2003), which has recently been shown to work for formality (Brooke et al, 2010), a dimension of stylistic variation that seems closely related to readability. Taboada et al (2011) validate their sentiment lexicon using crowd sourced judgments of the relative polarity of pairs of words, and in fact crowd sourcing has been applied directly to the creation of emotion lexicons (Mohammad and Turney, 2010). $$$$$ Thanks to Diana Inkpen and Diman Ghazi for early discussions on emotion.

Mohammad and Turney (2010) created a crowd sourced term emotion association lexicon consisting of associations of over 10,000 word-sense pairs with eight emotions joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust, surprise, and anticipation argued to be the basic and prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980). $$$$$ Even though considerable attention has been given to semantic orientation of words and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons.

The Mohammad and Turney (2010) lexicon also has associations with positive and negative polarity. $$$$$ This work is intended to be a pilot study before we create a much larger emotion lexicon with tens of thousands of terms.
The Mohammad and Turney (2010) lexicon also has associations with positive and negative polarity. $$$$$ If an annotator is not familiar with the target word and still attempts to answer questions pertaining to the target, or is randomly clicking options in our questionnaire, then there is a 75% chance that they will get the answer to this question wrong, and we can discard all responses pertaining to this target term by the annotator (that is, we discard answers to the emotion questions provided by the annotator for this target term).

According to Mohammad and Turney (2010), adverbs and adjectives are some of the most emotion-inspiring terms. $$$$$ We focus on the Plutchik emotions because the emotions can be naturally paired into opposites—joy– sadness, anger–fear, trust–disgust, and anticipationsurprise.
According to Mohammad and Turney (2010), adverbs and adjectives are some of the most emotion-inspiring terms. $$$$$ Observe that the percentages for trust and joy are much lower.

Mohammad and Turney (2010) compiled emotion an notations for about 4000 words with eight emotions (six of Ekman, trust, and anticipation). $$$$$ Even though considerable attention has been given to semantic orientation of words and the creation of large polarity lexicons, research in emotion analysis has had to rely on limited and small emotion lexicons.

The questions are phrased exactly as described in Mohammad and Turney (2010). $$$$$ WordNet Affect Lexicon (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) has a few hundred words annotated with the emotions they evoke.2 It was created by manually identifying the emotions of a few seed words and then marking all their WordNet synonyms as having the same emotion.

The questions were phrased exactly as described in Mohammad and Turney (2010). If an annotator answers Q1 incorrectly, then in formation obtained from the remaining questions is discarded. $$$$$ We will use the emotion lexicon to identify emotional tone of larger units of text, such as newspaper headlines and blog posts.
