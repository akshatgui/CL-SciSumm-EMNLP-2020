 $$$$$ Part of speech (POS) tags serve an important role in statistical parsing by providing the model with a level of generalization as to how classes of words tend to behave, what roles they play in sentences, and what other classes they tend to combine with.

This is consistent with the findings of Collins et al (1999) for Czech, where the bigram model upped dependency accuracy by about 0.9%, as well as for English where Charniak (2000) reports an increase in F-score of approximately 0.3%. $$$$$ To fix these problems, the non-terminal label in coordination cases was altered to be the same as that of the second conjunct (the phrase directly to the right of the head of the phrase).

 $$$$$ This paper considers statistical parsing of Czech, using the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Haji, 1998) as a source of training and test data (the PDT contains around 480,000 words of general news, business news, and science articles Other Slavic languages (such as Polish, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Serbo-croatian, Ukrainian) also show these characteristics.
 $$$$$ A major area for future work is likely to be an improved treatment of morphology; a natural approach to this problem is to consider more carefully how POS tags are used as word classes by the model.

 $$$$$ Using that large a tagset with a training corpus of only 19,000 sentences would lead to serious sparse data problems.
 $$$$$ We ran three versions of the parser over the final test set: the baseline version, the full model with all additions, and the full model with everything but the bigram model.
 $$$$$ In these cases the baseline approach gives tree structures such as that in figure 5(a).
 $$$$$ We have begun to investigate this issue, through the automatic derivation of POS tags through clustering or &quot;splitting&quot; approaches.

To create dependency structures from the Penn Treebank, we used the extraction rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), which are an approximation to the lexicalization rules of Collins (1999). $$$$$ See figure 1 for an example lexicalized tree, and a list of the lexicalized rules that it contains.

Lattice parsing (Chappelier et al, 1999) is an alternative to a pipeline that prevents cascading errors by placing all segmentation options into the parse chart. $$$$$ (Note that the rich inflectional morphology of Czech leads to a higher rate of &quot;unknown&quot; word forms than would be true in English; in one test, 29.5% of the words in test data were &quot;unknown&quot;) Our tests indicated that if unknown words are treated by believing the POS tagger's suggestion, then scores are better if the parser is also trained on the POS tagger's suggestions, rather than on the human annotator's correct tags.

For the Czech data, we used the predefined training, development and testing split of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc et al., 2001), and the automatically generated POS tags supplied with the data, which we reduce to the POS tag set from Collins et al (1999). $$$$$ When tested with the final version of the parser on the full development set, those two strategies performed at the same level.

 $$$$$ We then describe a series of refinements to the model, giving an improvement to 80% accuracy, with around 82% accuracy on newspaper/business articles.

The mechanism we employ for incorporating morphology into the PCFG model (the Model 1 parser in (Collins, 1999)) is the modification of its part-of speech (POS) tag set; in this paper, we explain how this mechanism allows the parser to better capture morphological constraints. $$$$$ (Collins 97) describes a series of refinements to this basic model: the addition of &quot;distance&quot; (a conditioning feature indicating whether or not a modifier is adjacent to the head); the addition of subcategorization parameters (Model 2), and parameters that model wh-movement (Model 3); estimation techniques that smooth various levels of back-off (in particular using POS tags as word-classes, allowing the model to learn generalizations about POS classes of words).
