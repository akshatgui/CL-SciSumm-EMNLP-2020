 $$$$$ We have begun to investigate this issue, through the automatic derivation of POS tags through clustering or &quot;splitting&quot; approaches.
 $$$$$ We ran three versions of the parser over the final test set: the baseline version, the full model with all additions, and the full model with everything but the bigram model.
 $$$$$ We describe our experience in building on the parsing model of (Collins 97).
 $$$$$ Given these differences, it is difficult to make a direct comparison, but the overall conclusion seems to be that the Czech accuracy is approaching results on English, although it is still somewhat behind.

 $$$$$ The final system achieved 80.0% accuracy3: a 7.7% absolute improvement and a 27.8% relative improvement.
 $$$$$ The STOP symbol is added to the vocabulary of nonterminals, and the model stops generating left modifiers when it is generated.
 $$$$$ A major area for future work is likely to be an improved treatment of morphology; a natural approach to this problem is to consider more carefully how POS tags are used as word classes by the model.
 $$$$$ Even richer tagsets that also included the person, gender, and number values were tested without yielding any further improvement, presumably because the damage from sparse data outweighed the value of the additional information present.

Collins et al (1999) used transformed constituency tree bank from Prague Dependency Treebank for constituent parsing on Czech. $$$$$ Our final results — 80% dependency accuracy — represent good progress towards the 91% accuracy of the parser on English (Wall Street Journal) text.
Collins et al (1999) used transformed constituency tree bank from Prague Dependency Treebank for constituent parsing on Czech. $$$$$ In initial tests, this combination of training on the correct tags and allowing all dictionary tags for unknown test words somewhat outperformed the alternative of using the POS tagger's predictions both for training and for unknown test words.
Collins et al (1999) used transformed constituency tree bank from Prague Dependency Treebank for constituent parsing on Czech. $$$$$ For evaluation purposes, the PDT has been divided into a training set (19k sentences) and a development/evaluation test set pair (about 3,500 sentences each).

This is consistent with the findings of Collins et al (1999) for Czech, where the bigram model upped dependency accuracy by about 0.9%, as well as for English where Charniak (2000) reports an increase in F-score of approximately 0.3%. $$$$$ In PCFGs each rule a —> in the CFG underlying the PCFG has an associated probability P(/31a).
This is consistent with the findings of Collins et al (1999) for Czech, where the bigram model upped dependency accuracy by about 0.9%, as well as for English where Charniak (2000) reports an increase in F-score of approximately 0.3%. $$$$$ In (Collins 97), P (01a) is defined as a product of terms, by assuming that the right-hand-side of the rule is generated in three steps: probability I P, h, H), where Ln+i (in+1) = STOP.
This is consistent with the findings of Collins et al (1999) for Czech, where the bigram model upped dependency accuracy by about 0.9%, as well as for English where Charniak (2000) reports an increase in F-score of approximately 0.3%. $$$$$ The parser of (Collins 96) used punctuation as an indication of phrasal boundaries.

 $$$$$ It is also clear that some of the distinctions being made by the tags are more important than others for parsing.
 $$$$$ The 80% dependency accuracy of the parser represents good progress towards English parsing performance.
 $$$$$ The Science section of the development set is considerably harder to parse (presumably because of longer sentences and more open vocabulary).
 $$$$$ We write non-terminals as X (x): X is the non-terminal label, and x is a (w, t) pair where w is the associated head-word, and t as the POS tag.

 $$$$$ (Collins 99) describes results of 91% accuracy in recovering dependencies on section 0 of the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, using Model 2 of (Collins 97).
 $$$$$ As Czech is a HI language, the size of the set of possible tags is unusually high: more than 3,000 tags may be assigned by the Czech morphological analyzer.
 $$$$$ The non-terminal label for the phrase is JP (because the head of the phrase, the conjunct and, is tagged as J).

To create dependency structures from the Penn Treebank, we used the extraction rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), which are an approximation to the lexicalization rules of Collins (1999). $$$$$ Thus the number of nodes is equal to the number of tokens (words + punctuation) plus one (an artificial root node with rather technical function is added to each sentence).

To create dependency structures from the Penn Treebank, we used the extraction rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), which are an approximation to the lexicalization rules of Collins (1999). $$$$$ For example, the tag NNMP1 A would be used for a word that had &quot;noun&quot; as both its main and detailed part of speech, that was masculine, plural, nominative (case 1), and whose negativeness value was &quot;affirmative&quot;.

In particular, we used the method of Collins et al (1999) to simplify part-of-speech tags since the rich tags used by Czech would have led to a large but rarely seen set of POS features. $$$$$ (Collins 97) describes a series of refinements to this basic model: the addition of &quot;distance&quot; (a conditioning feature indicating whether or not a modifier is adjacent to the head); the addition of subcategorization parameters (Model 2), and parameters that model wh-movement (Model 3); estimation techniques that smooth various levels of back-off (in particular using POS tags as word-classes, allowing the model to learn generalizations about POS classes of words).

The Czech parser of Collins et al (1999) was run on a different data set and most other dependency parsers are evaluated using English. $$$$$ Much of the recent research on statistical parsing has focused on English; languages other than English are likely to pose new problems for statistical methods.
The Czech parser of Collins et al (1999) was run on a different data set and most other dependency parsers are evaluated using English. $$$$$ This two-letter scheme resulted in 58 tags, and provided about a 1.1% parsing improvement over the baseline on the development set.

Lattice parsing (Chappelier et al, 1999) is an alternative to a pipeline that prevents cascading errors by placing all segmentation options into the parse chart. $$$$$ We describe our experience in building on the parsing model of (Collins 97).

For the Czech data, we used the predefined training, development and testing split of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc et al., 2001), and the automatically generated POS tags supplied with the data, which we reduce to the POS tag set from Collins et al (1999). $$$$$ Each rule has the fonnl : 'With the exception of the top rule in the tree, which has the form TOP H (h) .

 $$$$$ In test data, the correct answer was not available, but the POS tagger output could be used if desired.
 $$$$$ The PDT contains also a traditional morpho-syntactic annotation (tags) at each word position (together with a lemma, uniquely representing the underlying lexical unit).
 $$$$$ Neither tested approach resulted in any improvement in parsing performance compared to the hand-designed &quot;two letter&quot; tagset, but the implementations of each were still only preliminary, and a clustered tagset more adroitly derived might do better.
 $$$$$ The STOP symbol is added to the vocabulary of nonterminals, and the model stops generating left modifiers when it is generated.

 $$$$$ The Prague Dependency Treebank PDT (Hap, 1998) has been modeled after the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 93), with one important exception: following the Praguian linguistic tradition, the syntactic annotation is based on dependencies rather than phrase structures.
 $$$$$ Our final results — 80% dependency accuracy — represent good progress towards the 91% accuracy of the parser on English (Wall Street Journal) text.
 $$$$$ Training on the correct tags results in 1% worse performance.

This F-measure is based on the recall and precision figures reported in Figure 7.15 in Collins (1999). $$$$$ Many statistical parsing methods developed for English use lexicalized trees as a representation (e.g., (Jelinek et al. 94; Magerman 95; Ratnaparkhi 97; Charniak 97; Collins 96; Collins 97)); several (e.g., (Eisner 96; Collins 96; Collins 97; Charniak 97)) emphasize the use of parameters associated with dependencies between pairs of words.
This F-measure is based on the recall and precision figures reported in Figure 7.15 in Collins (1999). $$$$$ As usual, with the development test set being available during the development phase, all final results has been obtained on the evaluation test set, which nobody could see beforehand.
This F-measure is based on the recall and precision figures reported in Figure 7.15 in Collins (1999). $$$$$ Parsing accuracy is defined as the ratio of correct dependency links vs. the total number of dependency links in a sentence (which equals, with the one artificial root node added, to the number of tokens in a sentence).
This F-measure is based on the recall and precision figures reported in Figure 7.15 in Collins (1999). $$$$$ This task is almost certainly easier for a number of reasons: there was more training data (40,000 sentences as opposed to 19,000); Wall Street Journal may be an easier domain than the PDT, as a reasonable proportion of sentences come from a sub-domain, financial news, which is relatively restricted.

As the interest of the NLP community grows to encompass more languages, we observe efforts towards adapting an English parser for parsing other languages (e.g., (Collins et al, 1999)), or towards designing a language-independent framework based on principles underlying the models for parsing English (Bikel, 2002). $$$$$ In the Czech parser we added a cost of -2.5 (log probability)2 to structures that violated this constraint.
