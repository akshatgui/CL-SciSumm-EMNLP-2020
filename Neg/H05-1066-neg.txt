We use three base models for dependency parsing: MST parser (McDonald et al 2005), Maltparser (Nivre et al 2006), and the ensemble parser of Surdeanu and Manning (2010). $$$$$ Czech POS tags are very complex, consisting of a series of slots that may ormay not be filled with some value.

 $$$$$ The resulting online update (to be inserted in Figure 4, line 4) would then be: min ? ?w(i+1) ? w(i) ? ?
 $$$$$ Then the number of constraints is O(n2), since for each node we must maintain n ? 1 constraints.The factored constraints are in general more re strictive than the original constraints, so they mayrule out the optimal solution to the original problem.
 $$$$$ There are at most O(n) recursive calls since we cannot contract the graph more then n times.

 $$$$$ Furthermore, the resultingparsing algorithms are more efficient than lexi calized phrase structure approaches to dependencyparsing, allowing us to search the entire space with out any pruning.
 $$$$$ The only remaining problem is how to learn the weight vector w. A major advantage of our approach over other dependency parsing models is its uniformity and simplicity.

 $$$$$ Furthermore, it is trivial to show that the Eisner algorithm solves the maximum projective spanning tree problem.
 $$$$$ Hence, finding a (projective) depen dency tree with highest score is equivalent to finding a maximum (projective) spanning tree in Gx.
