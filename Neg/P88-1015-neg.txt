Whittaker and Stenton (1988) devised rules for allocating dialogue control based on utterance types, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) utilized these rules for an analytical study on discourse segmentation. $$$$$ A number of researchers have shown that there is organisation in discourse above the level of the individual utterance (5, 8, 9, 10), The current exploratory study uses control as a parameter for identifying these higher level structures.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) devised rules for allocating dialogue control based on utterance types, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) utilized these rules for an analytical study on discourse segmentation. $$$$$ The pattern is not as obvious for prompts and repetitions/summaries, with 57% of prompts occurring within topic and 67% of repetitions/summaries occurring within topic.

Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ The main result of this exploratory study is the finding that control is a useful parameter for identifying discourse structure.
Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ With the exception of the first topic in Dialogues 1 and 4, the client has control of more turns in every topic before the central shift, whereas after it, the expert has control for more turns in every topic.
Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (7) showed that intonational contour is closely related to discourse segmentation with new topics being signalled by changes in intonational contour.

Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ Participants used certain types of signals when discourse goals were proceeding successfully but resorted to interruptions when they were not.
Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ We investigated the mechanism for changing control between these structures and found that utterance type and not cue words predicted shifts of control.
Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ For example a speaker might use the expression &quot;so&quot; to signal that s/he is about to conclude what s/he has just said.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (7) showed that intonational contour is closely related to discourse segmentation with new topics being signalled by changes in intonational contour.

Initiative is held by the speaker who is driving the conversation at any given point in the conversation (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ The two rules which express this principle concern the effectiveness of the plan and the ambiguity of the plan: (B1) If the listener believes P and either believes that P presents an obstacle to the proposed plan or believes that part of the proposed plan has already been satisfied, then interrupt; (B2) If the listener believes that an assertion about the proposed plan is ambiguous, then interrupt.
Initiative is held by the speaker who is driving the conversation at any given point in the conversation (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ We first examined the last utterance of each phase on the grounds that one mechanism for indicating the end of a phase would be for the speaker controlling the phase to give some cue that he (both participants in the dialogues were always male) no longer wished to control the discourse.
Initiative is held by the speaker who is driving the conversation at any given point in the conversation (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ Yes or no answers to questions were also classified as assertions on the grounds that they were supplying the listener with factual information; (b) Commands utterances which were intended to instigate action in their audience.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) looked at the correlation of control boundaries to discourse markers, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) looked at anaphoric reference. $$$$$ There was a total of 56 shifts of control over the 4 dialogues and we identified 3 main classes of cues used to signal control shifts These were prompts, repetitions and summaries.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) looked at the correlation of control boundaries to discourse markers, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) looked at anaphoric reference. $$$$$ How then do repetitions and summaries operate as cues?

In our study, the first author coded initiative using the annotation scheme of Whittaker and Stenton (1988). $$$$$ We might therefore explain these shifts as resulting from the person in control explicitly indicating that he had nothing more to say.
In our study, the first author coded initiative using the annotation scheme of Whittaker and Stenton (1988). $$$$$ On a total of 6 occasions (11% of shifts) the client interrupted to contradict the speaker or to supply what seemed to be relevant information that he believed the expert did not know.
In our study, the first author coded initiative using the annotation scheme of Whittaker and Stenton (1988). $$$$$ What is apparent is that it is highly unusual for a participant to seize control and change topic by interruption.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) assigned initiative to the speaker of statements, except when it was the answer to a question, in which case it belonged to the speaker asking the question. $$$$$ We suggest the following two principles might account for interruptions: these principles concern: (a) the information upon which the participants are basing their plans, and (b) the plans themselves.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) assigned initiative to the speaker of statements, except when it was the answer to a question, in which case it belonged to the speaker asking the question. $$$$$ A second indirect way of signalling discourse structure is intonation.

After experimenting with several tagging methods, we concluded that the approach presented in Walker and Whittaker (1990) adopted from (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) best captured the aspects of the dialogue we were interested in and, as with the DAs, could be tagged reliably on our data. $$$$$ We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between control and discourse structure.

Constructs such as Initiative and Control (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988), which attempt to operationalize the authority over a discourse's structure, fall under the umbrella of positioning. $$$$$ We applied control criteria to four dialogues and identified 3 levels of discourse structure.

A speaker who begins a discourse segment is said to have initiative, while control accounts for which speaker is being addressed in a dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ The problem with this approach is that the cue may only be an infrequent indicator of a particular type of shift.
