Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between control and discourse structure.
Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ We then go on to address how conversational participants co-ordinate moves between these higher level units, in particular looking at the ways they use to signal the beginning and end of such high level units.

Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ If we want to construct a general theory of discourse than we want to know about the whole range of cues serving this function.
Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ Paraphrases were classified as questions on the grounds that the effect was to induce the listener to confirm or deny what had just been stated; (d) Prompts - These were utterances which did not express propositional content.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ A second problem with previous research is that the criteria for identifying discourse structure are not always made explicit.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ We applied control criteria to four dialogues and identified 3 levels of discourse structure.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ For interruptions, 90% occur within topic, i.e. they do not result in topic shifts.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ For the control phases, we found that three types of utterances (prompts, repetitions and summaries) were consistently used to signal control shifts.

Initiative is held by the speaker who is driving the conversation at any given point in the conversation (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ For the low level structures we identified, (i.e. control phases), cue words and phrases were not as reliable in predicting shifts.

Initiative is held by the speaker who is driving the conversation at any given point in the conversation (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ The pattern is not as obvious for prompts and repetitions/summaries, with 57% of prompts occurring within topic and 67% of repetitions/summaries occurring within topic.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) looked at the correlation of control boundaries to discourse markers, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) looked at anaphoric reference. $$$$$ Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (7) showed that intonational contour is closely related to discourse segmentation with new topics being signalled by changes in intonational contour.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) looked at the correlation of control boundaries to discourse markers, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) looked at anaphoric reference. $$$$$ We identified topic shifts in the following way: Five judges were presented with the four dialogues and in each of the dialogues we had marked where control shifts occurred.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) looked at the correlation of control boundaries to discourse markers, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) looked at anaphoric reference. $$$$$ Each of these rules related control to utterance type: (a) For questions, the speaker was defined as being in control unless the question directly followed a question or command by the other conversant.

In our study, the first author coded initiative using the annotation scheme of Whittaker and Stenton (1988). $$$$$ The problem with this approach is that the cue may only be an infrequent indicator of a particular type of shift.
In our study, the first author coded initiative using the annotation scheme of Whittaker and Stenton (1988). $$$$$ The tape recordings from four dialogues were then transcribed and the analysis conducted on the typewritten transcripts rather than the raw recordings.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) assigned initiative to the speaker of statements, except when it was the answer to a question, in which case it belonged to the speaker asking the question. $$$$$ We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between control and discourse structure.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) assigned initiative to the speaker of statements, except when it was the answer to a question, in which case it belonged to the speaker asking the question. $$$$$ It seems that on the majority of occasions (63%) participants wait for the strongest possible cue (the prompt) before changing topic. control.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) assigned initiative to the speaker of statements, except when it was the answer to a question, in which case it belonged to the speaker asking the question. $$$$$ Another focus of current research has been the modelling of speaker and listener goals (1, 3) but there has been little research on real dialogues investigating how goals are communicated and inferred.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ It seems likely therefore that some of our findings (e.g the central shift) will be specific to the diagnostic dialogues we studied.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ We applied the control rules and found that control did not alternate from speaker to speaker on a turn by turn basis, but that there were long sequences of turns in which control remained with one speaker.

Following Whittaker and Stenton (1988), we use utterance tags to determine whether an utterance shows initiative $$$$$ When plans are perceived as succeeding, participants use explicit cues such as prompts, repetitions and summaries to signal their readiness to move to the next stage of the plan.
Following Whittaker and Stenton (1988), we use utterance tags to determine whether an utterance shows initiative $$$$$ A final more indirect cue to discourse structure is the speaker's choice of referring expressions and grammatical structure.

Following Whittaker and Stenton (1988), we use utterance tags to determine whether an utterance shows initiative $$$$$ (b) For assertions, the speaker was defined as being in control unless the assertion was made in response to a question, for the same reasons as those given for questions; an assertion which is a response to a question could not be said to be controlling the discourse; (c) For commands, the speaker was defined as controlling the conversation.

After experimenting with several tagging methods, we concluded that the approach presented in Walker and Whittaker (1990) adopted from (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) best captured the aspects of the dialogue we were interested in and, as with the DAs, could be tagged reliably on our data. $$$$$ 4.1 Identifying topic shifts.

Constructs such as Initiative and Control (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988), which attempt to operationalize the authority over a discourse's structure, fall under the umbrella of positioning. $$$$$ &quot;What I would do if I were you is to relink X&quot;) but were intended to induce some action; (c) Questions - utterances which were intended to elicit information from the audience.

A speaker who begins a discourse segment is said to have initiative, while control accounts for which speaker is being addressed in a dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ We investigated the mechanism for changing control between these structures and found that utterance type and not cue words predicted shifts of control.
