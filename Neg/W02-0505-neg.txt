The spelling-based model we propose (described in detail in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002)) directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences, which are trained on a small English/Arabic name list without the need for English pronunciations. $$$$$ The reason for this is that most names in the dictionary are of English origin.

Transliteration from English to Arabic and Chinese is complicated (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ The use of this spelling correction model slightly improves our transliterations, as shown in Table 3.
Transliteration from English to Arabic and Chinese is complicated (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ In some cases, the first name of a person might be of one category and the last name of another (e.g.,&quot;jn....4.. j..c.&quot; Ali Rodriguez).

Transliteration from English to Arabic and Chinese is complicated (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ Moreover, if we want to apply this technique to transliterate a name into a language other than English, a large pronunciation dictionary is needed for that language, which is not easily obtainable.

Section 3 presents the letter-based transducer approach to Arabic-English transliteration proposed in (Al-Onaizan and Knight,2002), which we use as the main point of comparison for our substring-based models. $$$$$ We first show in Section 8.2.1 the overall accuracy of the phonetic-based model, the spelling-based model, and the linear combination of them.

The main point of comparison for the evaluation of our substring-based models of transliteration is the letter-based transducer proposed by (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ Transliteration is the process of replacing words in the source language with their approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents in the target language.

The main point of comparison for the evaluation of our substring-based models of transliteration is the letter-based transducer proposed by (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ The Web-based filtering is useful only for our spelling-based model since all candidates generated by the phonetic-based model are in the pronunciation dictionary and all have non-zero Web counts.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) proposed a spelling-based model which directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences. $$$$$ Also, most of the names in the dictionary are English names and with English names the human evaluator was rigid, mostly accepting only the exact-matching spelling.

These results are also comparable to other state-of-the-art statistical Arabic name trans literation systems such as (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ For example, Graham is typically transliterated by humans into Arabic as &quot;r .Orciham&quot; and not as jrcim&quot; .

A spelling-based model that directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letters was developed by Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002). $$$$$ So, we asked a bilingual speaker (a native speaker of Arabic) to transliterate the names in both data sets given the context they appear within in the Arabic document.

The phonetics-based and spelling-based models have been linearly combined into a single transliteration model in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b) for transliteration of Arabic named entities into English. $$$$$ This is because names that can be found in the dictionary have only a single spelling that for the most part agrees with our gold-standard.

To improve this performance, we plan to enrich the Arabic lexicon with more proper names, using either name recognition (Maloney and Niv, 1998) or a back translation approach after name recognition in English texts (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ For backtransliterating person names of English origin, this is not a big problem because many of such names are typically found in the dictionary.

To improve this performance, we plan to enrich the Arabic lexicon with more proper names, using either name recognition (Maloney and Niv, 1998) or a back translation approach after name recognition in English texts (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ Example I: Given the name &quot;r Luc sdam,&quot; its top transliteration was SADDAM, and the letter sequence alignment was: 6To reduce the parameters to be estimated and prevent data sparseness without loss of any practical modeling power, English letter sequences were restricted to a maximum of 3 letters, while Arabic ones were restricted to a maximum of 2 letters.

Subsequently, the performance of this system was greatly improved by combining different spelling and phonetic models (Al-Onaizan and Knight,2002). $$$$$ We introduce a new spelling-based model that is much more accurate than state-of-the-art phonetic-based models and can be trained on easier-toobtain training data.
Subsequently, the performance of this system was greatly improved by combining different spelling and phonetic models (Al-Onaizan and Knight,2002). $$$$$ This makes it possible to generate words that are not already defined in the word unigram model but obey English patterns.

For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation. $$$$$ After any of these letters, a space might be incorrectly deleted (e.g., &quot;,:y3_,J.,ti...a:jit,&quot; instead of &quot;,:y3_,J.,ti...a) bytr mndlswn&quot;) or inserted (e.g., &quot;Alfl Ats b d allh&quot; instead of &quot;ABlats.
For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation. $$$$$ We also compare the accuracy of our system to the accuracy of human translators.
For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation. $$$$$ The development test set contains 854 names (377 unique names) and the blind test set contains 218 (85 unique names).
For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation. $$$$$ However, the transliteration becomes far more difficult when transliterating between languages with very different sound and writing systems.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters. $$$$$ It consists of several steps, each defined as a probabilistic model represented as a finite state machine.
Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters. $$$$$ Metathesis in person names into Arabic is often a result of wrong transliterations by the person who transliterated in the original name in Arabic.
Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters. $$$$$ The distribution of person According to this model, the probability of transliterating Arabic word a into English word w is given by the following equation: The actual transliteration process is a graphsearch problem through millions of possible mappings to find the best path with English word sequence w that maximizes Pp(' Wia for a given Arabic word sequence a, as described by Knight and Graehl (1997).

Similarly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable. $$$$$ The transliteration score for an English word w given an Arabic word a is a linear combination of the phonetic-based and the spelling-based transliteration scores as follows:7
Similarly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable. $$$$$ Also, applying such technique to Arabic will most likely fail because without short vowels, the pronunciation is highly ambiguous, and so is its corresponding phonetic sequence.
Similarly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable. $$$$$ The phoneme sequence of the loan word is compared to the phonetic sequence of a set of English words found in a phonetic dictionary and the word with the most similar phonetic sequence is selected as the transliteration.
