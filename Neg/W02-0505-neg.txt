To improve this performance, we plan to enrich the Arabic lexicon with more proper names, using either name recognition (Maloney and Niv, 1998) or a back translation approach after name recognition in English texts (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ In their approach, loan words are first segmented into syllables using a combination of rules and statistical techniques.

 $$$$$ We also, present the transliteration accuracy of human translators on the same task.
 $$$$$ For instance, vowels in Arabic come in two varieties, long and short.
 $$$$$ Transliterating names from Arabic into English in either direction is a difficult task, mainly due to the differences in their sound and writing systems.
