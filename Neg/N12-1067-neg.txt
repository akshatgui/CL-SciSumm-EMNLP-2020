Dahlmeier and Ng (2012) propose an alternative evaluation scheme which, along with other properties, overcomes this by operating in terms of tokens rather than character offsets. $$$$$ In our work, the start and end of an edit are given as token offsets, while the HOO data uses character offsets.
Dahlmeier and Ng (2012) propose an alternative evaluation scheme which, along with other properties, overcomes this by operating in terms of tokens rather than character offsets. $$$$$ Automatic evaluation allows fast and inexpensive feedback during development, and objective and reproducible evaluation during testing time.

Unlike evaluating grammar error correction systems (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), correction detection cannot refer to a gold standard. $$$$$ We thank Chang Liu for comments on an earlier draft.
Unlike evaluating grammar error correction systems (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), correction detection cannot refer to a gold standard. $$$$$ This can be done efficiently, for example with the Bellman-Ford algorithm (Cormen et al., 2001).
Unlike evaluating grammar error correction systems (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), correction detection cannot refer to a gold standard. $$$$$ This optimal edit seis subsequently scored using mea- We test our on the Helping Our Own (HOO) shared task data and show that our method results in more accurate evaluation for grammatical error correction.
Unlike evaluating grammar error correction systems (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), correction detection cannot refer to a gold standard. $$$$$ Because p0 − p ≥ 1, the right hand side is at most −(u + 1)|E|.

 $$$$$ This is a contradiction.
 $$$$$ We present a novel method for evaluating grammatical error correction.

 $$$$$ We compute the edits between source-hypothesis sentence pairs, while the HOO scorer computes edits at the document level.
 $$$$$ The M2 scorer is available for download at http://nlp.comp.nus.edu.sg/software/.
 $$$$$ We present a novel method for evaluating grammatical error correction.

In order to overcome this problem, the Max Match (M2) scorer was proposed in (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b). $$$$$ We can combine them into a new edit e3 = (a1, b2, C1 + C2), where C1 + C2 is the concatenation of strings C1 and C2.
In order to overcome this problem, the Max Match (M2) scorer was proposed in (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b). $$$$$ Our method computes the sequence of phrase-level edits that achieves the highest overlap with the gold-standard annotation.

 $$$$$ Grammatical error correction is an important NLP task with useful applications for second language learning.
 $$$$$ We set the parameter u to 2, allowing up to two unchanged words per edit.

 $$$$$ Evaluation for error correction is typically done by computing F1 measure between a set of proposed system edits and a set of humanannotated gold-standard edits (Leacock et al., 2010).
