This is because certain parts-of-speech have been found to be better indicators of sentiment (Pang and Lee, 2004). $$$$$ Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) provide methods for sentencelevel analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not, but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classification.
