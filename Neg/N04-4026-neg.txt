A DP-based beam search procedure identical to the one used in (Tillmann,2004) is used to maximize over all oriented block segmentations. $$$$$ Since the block translation is generated from bottom-to-top, the blocks and do not have adjacent predecessors below them: they are generated by a default model without orientation component.

For details see (Tillmann, 2004). $$$$$ The score of a successor block depends on its predecessor block and on its orientation relative to the block .
For details see (Tillmann, 2004). $$$$$ The segmentation model uses a novel orientation component to handle swapping of neighbor blocks.

 $$$$$ In particular the orientation of the predecessor block is ignored: in future work, we might take into account that a certain predecessor block typically precedes other blocks.
 $$$$$ If a block is skipped e.g. block in Fig 3 by first generating block then block , the block is generated using left orientation .
