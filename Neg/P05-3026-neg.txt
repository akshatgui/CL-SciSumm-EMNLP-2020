Because of the fundamental nature of the semantic similarity problem, there are close connections with other areas of human language technologies such as information retrieval (Salton and Lesk, 1971), text alignment in machine translation (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), text summarization (Mani and Maybury, 1999), and textual coherence (Foltz et al, 1998). $$$$$ It scores better than an “oracle” that chooses the best original translation on a sentence-by-sentence basis.
