Because of the fundamental nature of the semantic similarity problem, there are close connections with other areas of human language technologies such as information retrieval (Salton and Lesk, 1971), text alignment in machine translation (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), text summarization (Mani and Maybury, 1999), and textual coherence (Foltz et al, 1998). $$$$$ A “decoding” algorithm then uses these alignments, in conjunction with confidence estimates for the various engines and a trigram language model, in order to score and rank a collection of sentence hypotheses that are synthetic combinations of words from the various original engines.

 $$$$$ These systems suffer from requiring cooperation from all the systems to produce compatible lattices as well as the hard research problem of standardizing confidence scores that come from the individual engines.
 $$$$$ With such a wide range of approaches to machine translation, it would be beneficial to have an effective framework for combining these systems into an MT system that carries many of the advantages of the individual systems and suffers from few of their disadvantages.

(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) tried to overcome this problem by using confidence scores and language models in order to rank a collection of synthetic combinations of words extracted from the original translation hypotheses. $$$$$ Since this space can grow exponentially, pruning based on scoring of the partial hypotheses is applied when necessary.

Other than confusion-network-based algorithms, work most closely related to ours is the method of MT system combination proposed in (Jayaraman and Lavie 2005), which we will refer to as J&L. $$$$$ One goal of the evaluation was to see how rich the space of synthetic translations produced by our hypothesis generator is.
