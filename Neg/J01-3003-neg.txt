there has been some work on the acquisition of thematic roles, (e.g., Merlo and Stevenson, 2001). $$$$$ On the further assumption that Agents tend to be animate entities more so than Themes are, we expect that unaccusatives will occur less frequently with an animate subject compared to unergative and object-drop verbs.

However, those works targeted a small subset of Levin classes, and a limited number of monosemous verbs; for example, Merlo and Stevenson (2001) studied three classes and 59 verbs, and Joanis et al (2008) focused on 14 classes and 835 verbs. $$$$$ The first line of Table 9 shows that the combination of all features achieves an accuracy of 69.8%, which is 35.9% over the baseline, for a reduction in the error rate of 54%.

The results reported in Tables 2 and 3 are significantly higher than those of Merlo and Stevenson (2001). $$$$$ As indicated in the table, unergatives are manner-of-motion verbs (from the &quot;run&quot; class in Levin), unaccusatives are changeof-state verbs (from several of the classes in Levin's change-of-state super-class), while object-drop verbs were taken from a variety of classes in Levin's classification, all of which undergo the unexpressed object alternation.
The results reported in Tables 2 and 3 are significantly higher than those of Merlo and Stevenson (2001). $$$$$ For each occurrence of each verb, we counted whether it was in a transitive or intransitive use (TRANS), in a passive or active use (PAss), in a past participle or simple past use (vBN), in a causative or non-causative use (cAus), and with an animate subject or not (ANim).4 Note that, except for the VBN feature, for which we simply extract the POS tag from the corpus, all other counts are approximations to the actual linguistic behaviour of the verb, as we describe in detail below.
The results reported in Tables 2 and 3 are significantly higher than those of Merlo and Stevenson (2001). $$$$$ The aggregate means by class of the normalized frequencies for all verbs are shown in Table 6; item by item distributions are provided in Appendix A, and raw counts are available from the authors.

This paper presents experiments in automatic classification of the animacy of unseen Norwegian common nouns, inspired by the method for verb classification presented in Merlo and Stevenson (2001). $$$$$ On 31 verbs that can take the same subcategorization(s) in different classes—more similar to our situation in that subcategorization alone cannot distinguish the classes—they achieve 83.9% accuracy compared to a 61.3% baseline, for a 58% reduction in error.
This paper presents experiments in automatic classification of the animacy of unseen Norwegian common nouns, inspired by the method for verb classification presented in Merlo and Stevenson (2001). $$$$$ Because knowledge of argument structure captures fundamental participant/event relations, it is crucial in parsing and generation (e.g., Srinivas and Joshi [1999]; Stede [1998]), in machine translation (Dorr 1997), and in information retrieval (Klavarts and Kan 1998) and extraction (Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998).

 $$$$$ For example, Merlo and Stevenson (1998) show that, contrary to the naive assumption, speakers' preferences in syntactic disambiguation are not simply directly related to frequency (i.e., a speaker's preference for one construction over another is not simply modelled by the frequency of the construction, or of the words in the construction).

Based on our observation and previous studies (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), we assume that each ILC has a distinct frequency distribution of roles on different grammatical slots. $$$$$ We think that using such linguistically motivated features makes the approach very effective and easily scalable: we report a 54% reduction in error rate (a 68% reduction, when the human expert-based upper bound is considered), using only five features that are readily extractable from automatically annotated corpora.
