Merlo and Stevenson (2001) present a method for verb classification which relies only on distributional statistics taken from corpora in order to train a decision tree classifier to distinguish between three groups of intransitive verbs. $$$$$ For example, the first row of the first panel of Table 14 shows that one unergative was incorrectly labelled as unaccusative, and two unergatives as object-drop.

This paper presents experiments in automatic classification of the animacy of unseen Norwegian common nouns, inspired by the method for verb classification presented in Merlo and Stevenson (2001). $$$$$ The Kappa value measures the experts', and our classifier's, degree of agreement over chance, with the gold standard and with each other.

 $$$$$ However, we have not yet addressed the problem of verbs that can have multiple classifications.
 $$$$$ Clearly, future work on our verb classification task will need to focus on determining features that better discriminate unaccusative and object-drop verbs.
 $$$$$ To preview our results, we demonstrate that combining just five numerical indicators, automatically extracted from large text corpora, is sufficient to reduce the error rate in this classification task by more than 50% over chance.

Based on our observation and previous studies (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), we assume that each ILC has a distinct frequency distribution of roles on different grammatical slots. $$$$$ We think that using such linguistically motivated features makes the approach very effective and easily scalable: we report a 54% reduction in error rate (a 68% reduction, when the human expert-based upper bound is considered), using only five features that are readily extractable from automatically annotated corpora.

In contrast to Merlo and Stevenson (2001), we confirmed that a set of general features can be successfully used, without the need for manually determining the relevant features for distinguishing particular classes. $$$$$ Thus, an important contribution of the work is the proposed mapping between the thematic assignment properties of the verb classes, and the statistical distributions of their surface syntactic properties.
