(1998) do not identify the head of subjects, subjects in embedded clauses, or subjects and objects related to the verb only through a trace, which makes their task easier.
This experiment is repeated on two different existing systems, which are reported in Buchholz et al (1999) and Carroll et al (1999), respectively. $$$$$ For example, in information retrieval it can be enough to find only simple NPs and VPs in a sentence, for information extraction we might also want to find relations between constituents as for example the subject and object of a verb.

For example, the Buchholz et al (1999) system ignores verb complements of verbs and is designed to look for relationships to verbs and not GRs that exist between nouns, etc. $$$$$ He suggests to first find the chunks and then the dependecies between these chunks.

For example, in our experiments, the Buchholz et al (1999) system uses the annotation np-sbj to indicate a subject, while the Ferro et al (1999) system uses the annotation subj. $$$$$ That paper also shows that the chunking method proposed here performs about as well as other methods, and that the influence of tagging errors on (NP) chunking is less than 1%.

TheIaU F-score is statistically signicantly better than the F-scores with either using Buchholz et al (1999) (IaB) or not using any initial annotations (NI). $$$$$ The former adds an extra informative feature to the instances of the latter (Feature 16 in Table 3).
