There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text $$$$$ How does Microsoft, or some other software vendor, want &quot;dialog box,&quot; &quot;text box,&quot; and &quot;menu box&quot; to be translated in their manuals?
There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text $$$$$ Compared with other word alignment algorithms (Brown et al., 1993; Gale and Church, 1991a), word_align does not require sentence alignment as input, and was shown to produce useful alignments for small and noisy corpora.

This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ We have developed a new program called aligning parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards that are available in two or more languages.

This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ This improvement increased the rate of constructing bilingual terminology lexicons at AT&T Language Line Services by a factor of 2-3.
This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ The sample was kindly provided by Simard et al., along with alignments of sentence boundaries as determined by their panel of 8 judges (Simard et al., 1992).

This concept of alignment has been also used for tasks like automatic vocabulary derivation and corpus alignment (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ Model 1 depends primarily on the translation probabilities, t(f(e), and does not make use of constraints involving the positions within an alignment.
This concept of alignment has been also used for tasks like automatic vocabulary derivation and corpus alignment (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ The method was intended as a replacement for sentence-based methods (e.g., (Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993)), which are very sensitive to noise.
This concept of alignment has been also used for tasks like automatic vocabulary derivation and corpus alignment (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ Taking the output of char_align as input, word_align produces significantly better, wordlevel, alignments on the kind of corpora that are typically available to translators.

In Ido Dagan et al (1993) noisy points were filtered out by deleting frequent words. $$$$$ The sample was kindly provided by Simard et al., along with alignments of sentence boundaries as determined by their panel of 8 judges (Simard et al., 1992).
In Ido Dagan et al (1993) noisy points were filtered out by deleting frequent words. $$$$$ Indeed, using bilingual concordances which are based on word_align's output, the translators at AT&T Language Line Services are now producing bilingual terminology lexicons at a rate of 60-100 terms per hour!
In Ido Dagan et al (1993) noisy points were filtered out by deleting frequent words. $$$$$ By hand, the best corresponding position in the French version was chosen, to be compared with word_align's output.

However, (Dagan et al, 1993) have shown that knowledge of target-text length is not crucial to the model's performance. $$$$$ The absence of such dependence can easily confuse the program, mainly in aligning adjacent occurrences of the same word, which are common in technical texts.
However, (Dagan et al, 1993) have shown that knowledge of target-text length is not crucial to the model's performance. $$$$$ In addition, the alignments may also be helpful to developers of lexicons for machine translation systems.
However, (Dagan et al, 1993) have shown that knowledge of target-text length is not crucial to the model's performance. $$$$$ We used the English and French versions of a manual of monitoring equipment (about 65,000 words), both scanned by an OCR device.

In the recent years, there have been a number of papers considering this or similar problems $$$$$ Fortunately, these parameters are highly redundant.
In the recent years, there have been a number of papers considering this or similar problems $$$$$ Then, in subsection 2.1.2, we describe modifications that achieve three goals: (1) enable word_align to accept input which may not be aligned by sentence (e.g. char_al:gn's output), (2) reduce the number of parameters that need to be estimated, and (3) prepare the ground for the second step, the search for the best alignment (described in section 2.2).
In the recent years, there have been a number of papers considering this or similar problems $$$$$ A second evaluation of word_align was performed on noisy technical documents, of the type typically available for AT&T Language Line Services.
In the recent years, there have been a number of papers considering this or similar problems $$$$$ We have developed a new program called aligning parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards that are available in two or more languages.

 $$$$$ Brown et al. therefore use Model 1 to obtain estimates for t(f le) which do not depend on the initial guesses.
 $$$$$ This relative frequency was computed according to the word frequencies in the stratified sample.
