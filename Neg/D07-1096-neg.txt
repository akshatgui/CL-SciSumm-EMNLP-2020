 $$$$$ In this section, we provide the task definitions that were used in the two tracks of the CoNLL 2007 Shard Task, the multilingual track and the domain adaptation track, together with some background and motivation for the design choices made.
 $$$$$ In the case of grammar based parsers, a classifier is used to disambiguate in cases where the grammar leaves some ambiguity (Schneider et al, 2007; Watson and Briscoe, 2007) 5.2.3 Learning Transition-based parsers either maintain a classifierthat predicts the next transition or a global proba bilistic model that scores a complete parse.

 $$$$$ The training data sets should include at least 50,000 tokens and at most 500,000 tokens.2 The final selection included data from Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, and Turkish.
 $$$$$ Accuracy begins to degrade gracefully after about ten different parsers have been added.
 $$$$$ A closer look at table 1 shows that while Basque and Greekin fact have small training data sets, so do Turkish and Italian.

For example, of ten treebanks for CoNLL-2007 shared task, none includes more than 500K tokens, while the sum of tokens from all tree banks is about two million (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ For the open class, the results are more spread out, but then thereare very few results in this class.

For example, of ten treebanks for CoNLL-2007 shared task, none includes more than 500K tokens, while the sum of tokens from all tree banks is about two million (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ It is thereforeunclear whether scores are more inflated by including word internal dependencies or deflated by excluding them.

Data-driven dependency parsing has recently received extensive attention in the parsing community and impressive results have been obtained for a range of languages (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ Similarly, two parsers trained with different learners and search directions were used in the co-learning approach of Sagae and Tsujii (2007).

The CoNLL-X (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) and CoNLL 2007 (Nivre et al, 2007) shared tasks focused on multilingual dependency parsing. $$$$$ But overcoming the bottleneckof limited annotated resources for specialized do mains will be as important for the deployment of human language technology as being able to handle multiple languages in the future.

The organizers of the CoNLL 2007 shared task noted that languages with free word order and high morphological complexity are the most difficult for dependency parsing (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ First of all, for four out of twenty-seven systems, no paper was submitted to the proceedings.
