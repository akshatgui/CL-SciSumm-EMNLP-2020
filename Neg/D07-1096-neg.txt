 $$$$$ In 2006 the shared task was multilingual dependency parsing, where participants had to train a single parser on data from thirteen different languages, which enabled a comparison not only of parsing and learning methods, but also of the performance that can be achieved for different languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
 $$$$$ In total, test results weresubmitted for twenty-three systems in the multilin gual track, and ten systems in the domain adaptationtrack (six of which also participated in the multilingual track).
 $$$$$ The type of the original annotation is either constituents plus (some)functions (c+f) or dependencies (d).

For example, of ten treebanks for CoNLL-2007 shared task, none includes more than 500K tokens, while the sum of tokens from all tree banks is about two million (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ For the train ing data, the number of words and sentences are given in multiples of thousands, and the averagelength of a sentence in words (including punctuation tokens).

The CoNLL-X (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) and CoNLL 2007 (Nivre et al, 2007) shared tasks focused on multilingual dependency parsing. $$$$$ The maximum spanning tree in this case is equal to the tree that on average contains the labeled dependencies that most systems voted for.

The organizers of the CoNLL 2007 shared task noted that languages with free word order and high morphological complexity are the most difficult for dependency parsing (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ Thirdly, we want to thank the program chairs for EMNLP-CoNLL 2007, Jason Eisner and Taku Kudo, the publications chair, Eric Ringger, the SIGNLL officers, Antal van den Bosch, Hwee Tou Ng, and Erik Tjong Kim Sang, and members of the LDC staff, Tony Castelletto and Ilya Ahtaridis, for great cooperation and support.

Morphologically rich languages present new challenges, as the use of state of the art parsers for more configurational and non-inflected languages like English does not reach similar performance levels in languages like Basque, Greek or Turkish (Nivre et al, 2007a). $$$$$ Teams are denoted by the last name of their first member, with italics indicating that there is no corresponding paper in the proceedings.

 $$$$$ Obtaining adequate annotated syntactic resourcesfor multiple languages is already a challenging prob lem, which is only exacerbated when these resources must be drawn from multiple and diverse domains.
 $$$$$ One important difference compared to the 2006 shared task is that all to kens were counted as ?scoring tokens?, including inparticular all punctuation tokens.
 $$$$$ Often, but not always, it is assumed that all words except one have a syntactic head, which means that the graph will be a tree with the single independent word as the root.

 $$$$$ A star next to a score in the Average column indicates a statistically significant difference with the next lower rank.
 $$$$$ Previous shared tasks of the Conference on Compu tational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) havebeen devoted to chunking (1999, 2000), clause iden tification (2001), named entity recognition (2002, 2003), and semantic role labeling (2004, 2005).
