 $$$$$ It causes the probability of a complete sequence to be set to zero if its use is necessary for a new text sequence, thus makes it impossible to rank different sequences containing a zero probability.
 $$$$$ And, last but not least, I would like to thank the users of TnT who provided me with bug reports and valuable suggestions for improvements.

The English POS-tagging has been carried out using freely available TNT tagger (Brants, 2000). $$$$$ This tagger, TnT, not only yielded the highest accuracy, it also was the fastest both in training and tagging.

Tag the tokens with PTB-style POS tags using a tagger (Brants, 2000). $$$$$ The latter are interesting, since usually unknown tokens are much more difficult to process than known tokens, for which a list of valid tags can be found in the lexicon.

Forun aligned words, we simply assign a random POS and very low probability, which does not substantially affect transition probability estimates. In Step 6 we build a tagger by feeding the es ti mated emission and transition probabilities into the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), an implementation of a trigram HMM tagger. $$$$$ Transition and output probabilities are estimated from a tagged corpus.

based on tree-structures of various complexity in the tree-adjoining grammar model. Using such tags, Brants (2000) has achieved the automated tagging of a syntactic-structure-based set of grammatical function tags including phrase-chunk and syntactic-role modifiers trained in supervised mode from a tree bank of German. $$$$$ Contrary to claims found elsewhere in the literature, we argue that a tagger based on Markov models performs at least as well as other current approaches, including the Maximum Entropy framework.

We use a corpus of 5 million words automatically tagged by TnT (Brants, 2000) and freely available online (Sharoff et al, 2008). Because we want to make linguistically-informed corruptions, we corrupt only the words we have information for, identifying the words in the corpus which are found in the lexicon with the appropriate POS tag. We also select only words which have inflectional morphology: nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals.7 4.2.1 Determining word properties (step 1) We use the POS tag to restrict the properties of a word, regardless of how exactly we corrupt it. $$$$$ Should we use all words, or are some of them better suited than others?
