Following Hale (2001) and Levy (2008), among others, the syntactic processor uses an incremental probabilistic Earley parser to compute a metric which correlates with increased reading difficulty. $$$$$ A Probabilistic Earley Parser As A Psycholinguistic Model
Following Hale (2001) and Levy (2008), among others, the syntactic processor uses an incremental probabilistic Earley parser to compute a metric which correlates with increased reading difficulty. $$$$$ The computation of prefix probabilities takes advantage of the design of the Earley parser (Earley, 1970) which by itself is not probabilistic.

Using the prefix probability, we can compute the word-by-word Surprisal (Hale, 2001), by taking the log ratio of the previous word's prefix probability against this word's prefix probability. $$$$$ Stolcke’s algorithm solves this problem by computing, at each word of an input string, the prefix probability.
Using the prefix probability, we can compute the word-by-word Surprisal (Hale, 2001), by taking the log ratio of the previous word's prefix probability against this word's prefix probability. $$$$$ Scaling this number by taking its log gives the surprisal, and defines a word-based measure of cognitive effort in terms of the prefix-based one.

Since the introduction of a parser-based calculation for surprisal by Hale (2001), statistical techniques have been become common as models of reading difficulty and linguistic complexity. $$$$$ Traditional language models used for speech are ngram models, in which n − 1 words of history serve as the basis for predicting the nth word.

Surprisal (Hale, 2001) is then a straightforward calculation from the prefix probability. $$$$$ If the grammar is consistent (the probabilities of all derivations sum to 1.0) then subtracting the prefix probability from 1.0 gives the total probability of all the analyses the parser has disconfirmed.
Surprisal (Hale, 2001) is then a straightforward calculation from the prefix probability. $$$$$ Stolcke’s innovation, as regards prefix probabilities is to add two additional pieces of information to each state: α, the forward, or prefix probability, and y the “inside” probability.

Both Hale (2001) and Levy (2008) used a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) as a language model in their implementations of surprisal theory. $$$$$ The grammar it parses is a probabilistic context-free phrase structure grammar (PCFG), e.g.
Both Hale (2001) and Levy (2008) used a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) as a language model in their implementations of surprisal theory. $$$$$ The probabilistic Earley parser computes all parses of its input, so as a psycholinguistic theory it is a total parallelism theory.

Hale (2001) pointed out that the ratio of the prefix probabilities. $$$$$ Stolcke’s innovation, as regards prefix probabilities is to add two additional pieces of information to each state: α, the forward, or prefix probability, and y the “inside” probability.
Hale (2001) pointed out that the ratio of the prefix probabilities. $$$$$ However, the garden path effect is still observable at “resigned” where the prefix probability ratio is nearly 10 times greater than at either of the nouns.

Hale (2001) suggests this quantity as an index of psycholinguistic difficulty. $$$$$ A Probabilistic Earley Parser As A Psycholinguistic Model
Hale (2001) suggests this quantity as an index of psycholinguistic difficulty. $$$$$ Psycholinguistic theories vary regarding the amount bandwidth they attribute to the human sentence processing mechanism.

Probably the best known measure of syntactic expectation is surprisal (Hale 2001) which can be coarsely defined as the negative log probability of word wt given the preceding words, typically computed using a probabilistic context-free grammar. $$$$$ This is typically done using conditional probabilities of the form the probability that the nth word will actually be wn given that the words leading up to the nth have been w1, w2, ... wn−1.

The original formulation of surprisal (Hale 2001) used a probabilistic parser to calculate these probabilities, as the emphasis was on the processing costs incurred when parsing structurally ambiguous garden path sentences. $$$$$ Even if a PCFG is consistent, it would appear to have another drawback: it only assigns probabilities to complete sentences of its language.
The original formulation of surprisal (Hale 2001) used a probabilistic parser to calculate these probabilities, as the emphasis was on the processing costs incurred when parsing structurally ambiguous garden path sentences. $$$$$ If there were separate processing costs distinct from the optimization costs postulated in the grammar, then strong competence is violated.

Hale (2001) reported that a probabilistic Earley parser can make correct predictions of garden-path effects and the subject/object relative asymmetry. $$$$$ Under grammatical assumptions supported by corpusfrequency data, the operation of Stolcke’s probabilistic Earley parser correctly predicts processing phenomena associated with garden path structural ambiguity and with the subject/object relative asymmetry.
Hale (2001) reported that a probabilistic Earley parser can make correct predictions of garden-path effects and the subject/object relative asymmetry. $$$$$ Grammar (3) generates both subject and object relative clauses.

Hale (2001) introduced the surprisal metric for probabilistic parsers, which measures the log ratio of the total probability mass at word t1 and word t. $$$$$ Finally, there is the possibility of total parallelism, in which the entire set of trees compatible with the input is maintained somehow from word to word.
Hale (2001) introduced the surprisal metric for probabilistic parsers, which measures the log ratio of the total probability mass at word t1 and word t. $$$$$ This prefix-based linking hypothesis can be turned into one that generates predictions about word-byword reading times by comparing the total effort expended before some word to the total effort after: in particular, take the comparison to be a ratio.

Hale (2001) showed that surprisal calculated from a probabilistic Earley parser correctly predicts well 356 known processing phenomena that were believed to emerge from structural ambiguities (e.g., garden paths) and Levy (2008) further demonstrated the relevance of surprisal to human sentence processing difficulty on a range of syntactic processing difficulty phenomena. $$$$$ Under grammatical assumptions supported by corpusfrequency data, the operation of Stolcke’s probabilistic Earley parser correctly predicts processing phenomena associated with garden path structural ambiguity and with the subject/object relative asymmetry.

The surprisal (Hale, 2001) at word wi refers to the negative log probability of wi given the preceding words, computed using the prefix probabilities of the parser. $$$$$ In speech recognition, one is often interested in the probability that some word will follow, given that a sequence of words has been seen.

Hale (2001) demonstrated that surprisal thus predicts strong garden-pathing effects in the classic sentence. $$$$$ Principle 1 The relation between the parser and grammar is one of strong competence.
Hale (2001) demonstrated that surprisal thus predicts strong garden-pathing effects in the classic sentence. $$$$$ On such a theory, garden-pathing cannot be explained by reanalysis.

An alternative is to keep track of all derivations, and predict difficulty at points where there is a large change in the shape of the probability distribution across adjacent parsing states (Hale, 2001). $$$$$ A state is a record that specifies An Earley parser has three main functions, predict, scan and complete, each of which can enter new states into the chart.
An alternative is to keep track of all derivations, and predict difficulty at points where there is a large change in the shape of the probability distribution across adjacent parsing states (Hale, 2001). $$$$$ Finally, complete propagates this change throughout the chart.

This conclusion is strengthened when we turn to consider the performance of the parser on the standard Penn Treebank test set: the Within model showed a small increase in F-score over the PCFG baseline, while the copy model showed no such advantage.5All the models we proposed offer a broad coverage account of human parsing, not just a limited model on a hand-selected set of examples, such as the models proposed by Jurafsky (1996) and Hale (2001) (but see Crocker and Brants 2000). $$$$$ A Probabilistic Earley Parser As A Psycholinguistic Model

Although this does not match the interpretation of the experimental results followed in this paper, it leaves open the possibility that the feature could model the data according to a different measure of parsing difficulty, such as surprisal (Hale, 2001). $$$$$ Scanning does not alter any probabilities.
