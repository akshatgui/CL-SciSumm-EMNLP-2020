In sentiment text classification, we also use two data sets $$$$$ Document polarity classification poses a significant challenge to data-driven methods, resisting traditional text-categorization techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002).

For our experiments, we employ a large, recently introduced IMDB movie review dataset (Maas et al, 2011), in place of the smaller dataset introduced in (Pang and Lee, 2004) more commonly used for sentiment analysis. $$$$$ We refer to this corpus as the polarity dataset.

Pang and Lee (2004) use a graph-based technique to identify and analyze only subjective parts of texts. $$$$$ However, we propose an alternative that avoids the need for such feature engineering

Graph based SSL learning has been successfully applied to opinion detection (Pang and Lee, 2004) but is not appropriate for dealing with large scale data sets. $$$$$ Document polarity classification poses a significant challenge to data-driven methods, resisting traditional text-categorization techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002).

We also cannot use prior graph construction methods for the document level (such as physical proximity of sentences, used in Pang and Lee (2004)) at the word sense level. $$$$$ To our knowledge, previous work has not integrated sentence-level subjectivity detection with document-level sentiment polarity.

Sentence-level subjectivity detection, where training data is easier to obtain than for positive vs. negative classification, has been successfully performed using supervised statistical methods alone (Pang and Lee, 2004) or in combination with a knowledge based approach (Riloff et al, 2006). $$$$$ To our knowledge, previous work has not integrated sentence-level subjectivity detection with document-level sentiment polarity.

Sentiment analysis can be dependently or independently done from subjectivity detection, although Pang and Lee (2004) state that subjectivity detection performed prior to the sentiment analysis leads to better results in the latter. $$$$$ A Sentimental Education

For instance, in Pang and Lee (2004), yd would be the polarity of the document and ysi would indicate whether sentence si is subjective or objective. $$$$$ Specifically, for a given document, we use the construction in Section 2.2 to build a graph wherein the source s and sink t correspond to the class of subjective and objective sentences, respectively, and each internal node vi corresponds to the document’s ith sentence si.

The local dependencies between sentiment labels on sentences is similar to the work of Pang and Lee (2004) where soft local consistency constraints were created between every sentence in a document and inference was solved using a min-cut algorithm. $$$$$ To our knowledge, previous work has not integrated sentence-level subjectivity detection with document-level sentiment polarity.

On the other hand, we associate sentiment polarity to a document on the whole as opposed to Pang and Lee (2004) which deals with sentiment prediction of subjectivity content only. $$$$$ Also, as mentioned above, subjectivity extracts can be provided to users as a summary of the sentiment-oriented content of the document.
