In sentiment text classification, we also use two data sets: one is the widely used Cornell movie-review dataset (Pang and Lee, 2004) and one dataset from product reviews of domain DVD (Blitzer et al, 2007). $$$$$ Document polarity classification poses a significant challenge to data-driven methods, resisting traditional text-categorization techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002).

For our experiments, we employ a large, recently introduced IMDB movie review dataset (Maas et al, 2011), in place of the smaller dataset introduced in (Pang and Lee, 2004) more commonly used for sentiment analysis. $$$$$ We refer to this corpus as the polarity dataset.

Pang and Lee (2004) use a graph-based technique to identify and analyze only subjective parts of texts. $$$$$ However, we propose an alternative that avoids the need for such feature engineering: we use an efficient and intuitive graph-based formulation relying on finding minimum cuts.

Graph based SSL learning has been successfully applied to opinion detection (Pang and Lee, 2004) but is not appropriate for dealing with large scale data sets. $$$$$ Document polarity classification poses a significant challenge to data-driven methods, resisting traditional text-categorization techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002).

 $$$$$ Suppose we have n items x1, ... , xn to divide into two classes C1 and C2, and we have access to two types of information: We would like to maximize each item’s “net happiness”: its individual score for the class it is assigned to, minus its individual score for the other class.

Sentence-level subjectivity detection, where training data is easier to obtain than for positive vs. negative classification, has been successfully performed using supervised statistical methods alone (Pang and Lee, 2004) or in combination with a knowledge based approach (Riloff et al, 2006). $$$$$ To our knowledge, previous work has not integrated sentence-level subjectivity detection with document-level sentiment polarity.

For instance, in Pang and Lee (2004), yd would be the polarity of the document and ysi would indicate whether sentence si is subjective or objective. $$$$$ Specifically, for a given document, we use the construction in Section 2.2 to build a graph wherein the source s and sink t correspond to the class of subjective and objective sentences, respectively, and each internal node vi corresponds to the document’s ith sentence si.

The local dependencies between sentiment labels on sentences is similar to the work of Pang and Lee (2004) where soft local consistency constraints were created between every sentence in a document and inference was solved using a min-cut algorithm. $$$$$ To our knowledge, previous work has not integrated sentence-level subjectivity detection with document-level sentiment polarity.

On the other hand, we associate sentiment polarity to a document on the whole as opposed to Pang and Lee (2004) which deals with sentiment prediction of subjectivity content only. $$$$$ Also, as mentioned above, subjectivity extracts can be provided to users as a summary of the sentiment-oriented content of the document.
