In contrast, this boosting-based rule learner learns a final hypothesis that is a subset of candidate rules (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004). $$$$$ Decision stumps are simple classifiers, where the final decision is made by only a single hypothesis or feature.

For this problem, we can apply a boosting technique presented in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004). $$$$$ The focused problem can be formalized as a general problem, called the tree classification problem.
For this problem, we can apply a boosting technique presented in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004). $$$$$ This problem is formally defined as follows.

Note that for simplicity we use bag-of-functional words and their part-of-speech intervening between a zero-pronoun and its candidate antecedent as features instead of learning syntactic patterns with the Bact algorithm (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004). $$$$$ For learning algorithms to identify these topics, a text is usually represented as a bag-of-words, where a text is regarded as a multi-set (i.e., a bag) of words and the word order or syntactic relations appearing in the original text is ignored.
Note that for simplicity we use bag-of-functional words and their part-of-speech intervening between a zero-pronoun and its candidate antecedent as features instead of learning syntactic patterns with the Bact algorithm (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004). $$$$$ A straightforward way to extend the traditional bag-of-words representation is to heuristically add new types of features to the original bag-of-words features, such as fixed-length n-grams (e.g., word bi-gram or tri-gram) or fixedlength syntactic relations (e.g., modifier-head relations).

posed by Kudo and Matsumoto (2004) is designed to learn subtrees useful for classification. $$$$$ Given T, find the optimal rule (ˆt, ˆy) that maximizes the gain, i.e., The most naive and exhaustive method, in which we first enumerate all subtrees F and then calculate the gains for all subtrees, is usually impractical, since the number of subtrees is exponential to its size.

Therefore, in order to identify word dependencies, we followed Kudo' s rule (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004) the original sentence. $$$$$ For learning algorithms to identify these topics, a text is usually represented as a bag-of-words, where a text is regarded as a multi-set (i.e., a bag) of words and the word order or syntactic relations appearing in the original text is ignored.
Therefore, in order to identify word dependencies, we followed Kudo' s rule (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004) the original sentence. $$$$$ It is the word-based dependency tree that assumes that each word simply modifies the next word.

This may be accomplished with SVMs 131 using a tree kernel, or the tree boosting classifier BACT described in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004). $$$$$ The final hypothesis of SVMs with tree kernel can be given by Similarly, the final hypothesis of our boosting algorithm can be reformulated as a linear classifier

Even though the approach in Kudo and Matsumoto (2004) and ours are similar, there are two clear distinctions. $$$$$ This is because the number of common features between similar instances exponentially increases with size.
