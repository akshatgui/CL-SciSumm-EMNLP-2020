Zhou and Su (2002) used a wide variety of features, which suggests that the relatively poor performance of the taggers used in CoNLL-2002 was largely due to the feature sets used rather than the machine learning method. $$$$$ This paper will focus on difference between our tagger and other traditional HMM-based taggers, as used in BBN's IdentiFinder.
