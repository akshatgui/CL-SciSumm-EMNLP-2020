Over the past few years, there has been considerable progress in the ability of manually created large-scale grammars, such as the English Resource Grammar (ERG, Copestake and Flickinger (2000)) or the ParGram grammars (Butt et al, 2002), to parse wide-coverage text and assign it deep semantic representations. $$$$$ The coverage of the grammars implemented in LSGRAM was, however, much smaller than the coverage of the English (Riezler et al., 2002) or German grammar in ParGram.

These tools have been developed to serve an Arabic Lexical Functional Grammar parser using XLE (Xerox Linguistics Environment) platform as part of the ParGram Project (Butt et al 2002). $$$$$ We report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform for six languages

The experiments reported in this paper use the English LFG grammar constructed as part of the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages

We parse a tree bank with the XLE platform (Crouch et al, 2008) and the English grammar developed within the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages

Aspects of this research have often had their own separate fora, such as the ACL 2005 workshop on deep lexical acquisition (Baldwin et al, 2005), as well as the TAG+ (Kallmeyer and Becker, 2006), Alpino (van der Beek et al, 2005), ParGram (Butt et al, 2002) and DELPH-IN (Oepen et al, 2002) projects and meetings. $$$$$ The coverage of the grammars implemented in LSGRAM was, however, much smaller than the coverage of the English (Riezler et al., 2002) or German grammar in ParGram.

A full system using the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) parsing system XLE and the grammars from the Parallel Grammar development project (ParGram; (Butt et al., 2002)) has been implemented, and we present preliminary results on English-to-German translation with a tree-labeling system trained on a small subsection of the Europarl corpus. $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages

In the work described in this paper, we employ the XLE platform using the grammars available for English and German from the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages

 $$$$$ These solutions often differ in efficiency or conceptual simplicity and one of the tasks within the ParGram project is to make design decisions which favor one theoretical analysis and concomitant implementation over another.
 $$$$$ The parallelism can be exploited in applications using the grammars

The experiments reported in this paper use the German LFG grammar constructed as part of the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages

This problem was illustrated using a German LFG grammar (Rohrer and Forst, 2006) constructed as part of the ParGram project (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ The coverage of the grammars implemented in LSGRAM was, however, much smaller than the coverage of the English (Riezler et al., 2002) or German grammar in ParGram.

We compared the output of the XLE system, a deep-grammar-based parsing system using the English Lexical-Functional Grammar previously constructed as part of the Pargram project (Butt et al, 2002), to the same gold standard. $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages

The only rule-based approach to German LFG-parsing we are aware of is the hand-crafted German grammar in the ParGram Project (Buttet al, 2002). $$$$$ The coverage of the grammars implemented in LSGRAM was, however, much smaller than the coverage of the English (Riezler et al., 2002) or German grammar in ParGram.

In order for our approach to work, the coverage of the precision grammars must be broad enough to parse a large corpus of grammatical sentences, and for this reason, we choose the XLE (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996), an efficient and robust parsing system for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplanand Bresnan, 1982) and the ParGram English grammar (Butt et al, 2002) for our experiments. $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages

The ParGram English LFG is a hand-crafted broad-coverage grammar developed over several years with the XLE platform (Butt et al, 2002). $$$$$ In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages
