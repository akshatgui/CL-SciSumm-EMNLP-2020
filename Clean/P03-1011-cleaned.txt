Gildea (2003) proposed a tree to tree alignment model using output from a statistical parser in both source and target languages. $$$$$ Yamada and Knight (2001) present an algorithm for estimating probabilistic parameters for a similar model which represents translation as a sequence of re-ordering operations over children of nodes in a syntactic tree, using automatic parser output for the initial tree structures.

Initially work focused on word-based alignment, but more recent research also addresses alignment at the higher levels (substrings, syntactic phrases or trees), e.g., [Gildea, 2003]. $$$$$ Loosely Tree-Based Alignment For Machine Translation
Initially work focused on word-based alignment, but more recent research also addresses alignment at the higher levels (substrings, syntactic phrases or trees), e.g., [Gildea, 2003]. $$$$$ Our loosely tree-based alignment techniques allow statistical models of machine translation to make use of syntactic information while retaining the flexibility to handle cases of non-isomorphic source and target trees.

 $$$$$ While the probability model for tree transformation operates from the top of the tree down, probability estimation for aligning two trees takes place by iterating through pairs of nodes from each tree in bottom-up order, as sketched below

However, even after extending this model by allowing cloning operations on subtrees, Gildea (2003) found that parallel trees over-constrained the alignment problem, and achieved better results with a tree-to-string model than with a tree-to-tree model using two trees. $$$$$ The tree-to-tree alignment model has tree transformation operations similar to those of the tree-tostring model described above.

Additional linguistic knowledge sources such as dependency trees or parse trees were used in (Cherry and Lin, 2003) and (Gildea, 2003). $$$$$ We present versions of this technique both for tree-to-string models, making use of parse trees for one of the two languages, and tree-to-tree models, which make use of parallel parse trees.

Daniel Gildea (2003) dealt with the problem of the parse tree isomorphism with a cloning operation to either tree-to-string or tree-to-tree alignment models. $$$$$ This is done by adding a new subtree cloning operation to either tree-to-string or tree-to-tree alignment algorithms.

Gildea (2003) trained a system on parallel constituent trees from the Korean-English Treebank, evaluating agreement with hand-annotated word alignments. $$$$$ We first present the tree-to-string model, followed by the tree-to-tree model, before moving on to alignment results for a parallel syntactically annotated Korean-English corpus, measured in terms of alignment perplexities on held-out test data, and agreement with human-annotated word-level alignments.

Our model of alignment is that of Gildea (2003), reviewed in Section 2 and extended to dependency trees in Section 3. $$$$$ “Tree-to-String” is the model of Yamada and Knight (2001), and “Tree-to-String, Clone” allows the node cloning operation of Section 2.1.

Both our constituent and dependency models make use of the "clone" operation introduced by Gildea (2003), which allows words to be aligned even in cases of radically mismatched trees, at a cost in the probability of the alignment. $$$$$ For example, even alignments with no change in word order may not be possible if the structures of the two trees are radically mismatched.

Syntax-based translation models, such as tree-to-string model (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and tree-to-tree model (Gildea, 2003), may be very suitable to be added into log-linear models. $$$$$ “Tree-to-String” is the model of Yamada and Knight (2001), and “Tree-to-String, Clone” allows the node cloning operation of Section 2.1.

Works that apply the TTT model include Gildea (2003) and Zhang et al (2008). $$$$$ For our experiments, we used a parallel KoreanEnglish corpus from the military domain (Han et al., 2001).

For the TTS systems (one for each translation direction), the training set will be lexically aligned using GIZA++ and for the TTT system, its syntactic trees will be aligned using techniques similar to the ones proposed by Gildea (2003) and by Zhang et al (2008). $$$$$ For scoring the viterbi alignments of each system against goldstandard annotated alignments, we use the alignment error rate (AER) of Och and Ney (2000), which measures agreement at the level of pairs of words

(Gildea, 2003) and (Galley et al, 2004) discuss different ways of generalizing the tree-level cross linguistic correspondence relation, so it is not confined to single tree nodes, thereby avoiding a continuity assumption. $$$$$ In order to provide enough flexibility to make this possible, additional tree transformation operations allow a single node in the source tree to produce two nodes in the target tree, or two nodes in the source tree to be grouped together and produce a single node in the target tree.
(Gildea, 2003) and (Galley et al, 2004) discuss different ways of generalizing the tree-level cross linguistic correspondence relation, so it is not confined to single tree nodes, thereby avoiding a continuity assumption. $$$$$ For example, with our maximum of two nodes, no transformation of the tree the generative probability model should be thought of as only generating single nodes on the target side.

(Gildea, 2003) performs tree-to-tree alignment, but treats it as part of a generative statistical translation model, rather than a seperate task. $$$$$ The tree-to-tree alignment model has tree transformation operations similar to those of the tree-tostring model described above.

(Gildea, 2003) outlines an algorithm for use in syntax-based statistical models of MT, applying a statistical TSG with probabilities parameterized to generate the target tree conditioned on the structure of the source tree. $$$$$ The model can be thought of as a synchronous tree substitution grammar, with probabilities parameterized to generate the target tree conditioned on the structure of the source tree.
