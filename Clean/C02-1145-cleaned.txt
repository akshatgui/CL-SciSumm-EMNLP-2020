After analyzing the dependency structure of sentences in Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1 (Xue et al, 2002), we found an interesting phenomenon: if we define a main-root as the head of a sentence, and define a subsentence as a sequence of words separated by punctuations, and the head1 of these words is the child of main root or main-root itself, then the punctuations that depend on main-root can be a separator of sub-sentences. $$$$$ There are three main factors that affect the annotation speed : annotators?
