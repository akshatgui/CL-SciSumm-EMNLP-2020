Smadja (1993) illustrates this by presenting 8 different ways of referring to the Dow Jones index, among which only 4 are used. $$$$$ For example, among the eight different expressions referring to the famous Wall Street index, only those used in sentences 1-4 are correct.

Smadja (1993) classifies them according to syntactic function while Sag et al (2002) classify them according to flexibility. $$$$$ Second, these techniques simply analyze the collocations according to their observed frequency in the corpus; this makes the results too dependent on the size of the corpus.
Smadja (1993) classifies them according to syntactic function while Sag et al (2002) classify them according to flexibility. $$$$$ According to this measure, DJ is much more focused than both the Brown Corpus and NYT because the difference in variety is 1 in the logarithmic scale.

Among early work on developing methods for MWE identification, there is that of Smadja (1993). $$$$$ Their work, however, has some limitations too.

Therefore, sublanguage techniques such as Sager (1981) and Smadja (1993) do not work. $$$$$ The work, however, has some limitations.

Baron and Hirst (2004) extracted collocations with Xtract (Smadja, 1993) and classified the collocations using the orientations of the words in the neighboring sentences. $$$$$ Retrieving Collocations From Text

Future work will include $$$$$ The techniques we describe retrieve the three types of collocations discussed in Section 2, and they have been implemented in a tool, Xtract.
Future work will include $$$$$ Although some other attempts have been made to retrieve collocations from textual corpora, no work has been able to retrieve the full range of the collocations that Xtract retrieves.

 $$$$$ This indicates that the actual distribution of the collocates of &quot;takeover&quot; has a large kurtosis.'

It is true that various term extraction systems have been developed, such as Xtract (Smadja 1993). $$$$$ Such techniques have various applications.

Schone & Jurafsky's results indicate similar results for log-likelihood & T-score, and strong parallelism among information-theoretic measures such as ChiSquared, Selectional Association (Resnik 1996), Symmetric Conditional Probability (Ferreira and Pereira Lopes, 1999) and the Z-Score (Smadja 1993). $$$$$ These peaks correspond to the js such that the z-score of p' is bigger than a given threshold 1c1.

One aspect of VPCs that makes them difficult to extract (cited in ,e.g., Smadja (1993)) is that the verb and particle can be non-contiguous. $$$$$ For example, if a bigram involves a noun and a verb, this stage identifies it either as a subject-verb or as a verb-object collocation.

Note, this is the same as the maximum span length of 5 used by Smadja (1993). $$$$$ First, by definition, it can only retrieve collocations of length two.
Note, this is the same as the maximum span length of 5 used by Smadja (1993). $$$$$ On a 12 million—word corpus, Choueka retrieved 10 collocations of length six, 115 collocations of length five, 1,024 collocations of length four, 4,777 of length three, and some 15,973 of length two.

One of the earliest attempts at extracting 'interrupted collocations' (i.e. non-contiguous collocations, including VPCs), was that of Smadja (1993). $$$$$ In the past, some similar attempts have been done.

Lastly, collocations are domain-dependent (Smadja 1993) and language-dependent. $$$$$ Linguistically mastering a domain such as the domain of sailing thus requires more than a glossary, it requires knowledge of domain-dependent collocations.

There have been many statistical measures which estimate co-occurrence and the degree of association in previous researches, such as mutual information (Church 1990, Sporat 1990), t-score (Church 1991), dice matrix (Smadja 1993, 1996). $$$$$ This stage is comparable to Church and Hanks (1989) in that it evaluates a certain word association between pairs of words.

Smadja (Smadja 1993) proposed a statistical model by measuring the spread of the distribution of co occurring pairs of words with higher strength. $$$$$ In this first stage, we thus use only statistical methods to identify relevant pairs of words.

This is an example of a collocation ,i.e. a sequence of words that tend to occur together and whose interpretation generally crosses the boundaries between words (Smadja, 1993). $$$$$ In this approach, a collocation is simply considered as a sequence of words (or n-gram) among millions of other possible sequences.
This is an example of a collocation ,i.e. a sequence of words that tend to occur together and whose interpretation generally crosses the boundaries between words (Smadja, 1993). $$$$$ A collocation, as defined by Choueka, is a sequence of adjacent words that frequently appear together.

In terms of practical MWE identification systems, a well known approach is that of Smadja (1993), who uses a set of techniques based on statistical methods, calculated from word frequencies, to identify MWEs in corpora. $$$$$ In this paper, we describe a set of techniques based on statistical methods for retrieving and identifying collocations from large textual corpora.

It would therefore be interesting to conduct this study on a larger scale, using more general MWE definitions such as automatically learned collocations (Smadja, 1993) or verb-noun constructions (Diab and Bhutada, 2009). $$$$$ For example, a noun and a verb will form a predicative relation if they are repeatedly used together with the noun as the object of the verb.
