Izumi et al (2003) and (2004) used error annotated transcripts of Japanese speakers in an interview-based test of spoken English to train a maximum entropy classifier (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to recognize 13 different types of grammatical and lexical errors, including errors involving prepositions. $$$$$ (e.g. article and tense errors) These are different from “error types” (omission or replacement).

For example, (Izumi et al, 2003) reported error rates for English prepositions that were as high as 10% in a Japanese learner corpus. $$$$$ Automatic Error Detection In The Japanese Learners' English Spoken Data
For example, (Izumi et al, 2003) reported error rates for English prepositions that were as high as 10% in a Japanese learner corpus. $$$$$ In this section, we would like to describe how we proceeded with error detection in the learner corpus.

(Izumi et al., 2003) and (Izumi et al, 2004) used an ME approach to classify different grammatical errors in transcripts of Japanese interviews. $$$$$ We applied different methods to detecting these two kinds of errors.

For example, in the Japanese Learners of English corpus (Izumi et al., 2003), errors related to verbs are among the most frequent categories. $$$$$ Automatic Error Detection In The Japanese Learners' English Spoken Data
For example, in the Japanese Learners of English corpus (Izumi et al., 2003), errors related to verbs are among the most frequent categories. $$$$$ This paper describes a method of detecting grammatical and lexical errors made by Japanese learners of English and other techniques that improve the accuracy of error detection with a limited amount of training data.

A maximum entropy model, using lexical and POS features, is trained in (Izumi et al, 2003) to recognize a variety of errors. $$$$$ The Maximum Entropy (ME) model (Jaynes 1957) is a general technique that is used to estimate the probability distributions of data.
A maximum entropy model, using lexical and POS features, is trained in (Izumi et al, 2003) to recognize a variety of errors. $$$$$ The over-riding principle in ME is that when nothing is known, the distribution should be as uniform as possible, i.e., maximum entropy.

Izumi et al (2003) consider several error types, including article and preposition mistakes, made by Japanese learners of English, and Nagata et al (2006) focus on the errors in mass/count noun distinctions with an application to detecting article mistakes also made by Japanese speakers. $$$$$ Here, there is an article missing in front of “telephone”, so this can be considered an omission-type error, which is categorized as an article error (“at” is a label that indicates that this is an article error.).

False starts and disfluencies were then cleaned up, and grammatical mistakes tagged (Izumi et al, 2003). $$$$$ We designed an original error tagset for learners’ grammatical and lexical errors, which were relatively easy to categorize.
False starts and disfluencies were then cleaned up, and grammatical mistakes tagged (Izumi et al, 2003). $$$$$ Our error tags contained three pieces of information, i.e., the part of speech, the grammatical/lexical system and the corrected form.

The usage of articles has been found to be the most frequent error class in the JLE corpus (Izumi et al, 2003). $$$$$ We prepared special tags for some errors that cannot be categorized into any word class, such as the misordering of words.
The usage of articles has been found to be the most frequent error class in the JLE corpus (Izumi et al, 2003). $$$$$ We first examined what kind of errors had been made with articles and found that “a”, “an”, “the” and the absence of articles were often confused.

In the future, we would like to search for more salient features through a careful study of non-native errors, using error-tagged corpora such as (Izumi et al., 2003). $$$$$ In this paper, we introduce a method of detecting learners’ errors, and we examine to what extent this could be accomplished using our learner corpus data including error tags that are labeled with the learners’ errors.

 $$$$$ Here, there is an article missing in front of “telephone”, so this can be considered an omission-type error, which is categorized as an article error (“at” is a label that indicates that this is an article error.).
 $$$$$ By adding corrected sentences and artificially made errors, the precision rate rose to 80% while the recall rate remained the same.

We based our error annotation scheme on that used in the NICT JLE corpus (Izumi et al, 2003a), whose detailed description is readily available, for example, in Izumi et al (2005). $$$$$ The following example is a sentence with an error tag.
We based our error annotation scheme on that used in the NICT JLE corpus (Izumi et al, 2003a), whose detailed description is readily available, for example, in Izumi et al (2005). $$$$$ Since some more detailed context might be necessary to decide whether “a” or “the” must be used, the features we used here might be insufficient.

The method (Izumi et al, 2003) aims to detect omission-type and replacement-type errors and transformation-based leaning is employed in (Shi and Zhou, 2005) to learn rules to detect errors for speech recognition outputs. $$$$$ As we did in detecting omission-type errors, if more than one error category was given, we use two methods of detection.
