For event terms, we first find the root verbs of deverbal nouns and then measure verb similarity by using the fine-grained relations provided by VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), which has proved useful in summarization (Liu et al, 2007). $$$$$ VerbOcean: Mining The Web For Fine-Grained Semantic Verb Relations

The work on VerbOcean is similar to our research in the use of the Web for acquiring relationships (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004). $$$$$ Previous web mining work has rarely addressed extracting many different semantic relations from Web-sized corpus.

Work on semantic similarity learning such as Chklovski and Pantel (2004) also automatically learns relations between verbs. $$$$$ Lin and Pantel (2001) describe an algorithm called DIRT (Discovery of Inference Rules from Text) that automatically learns paraphrase expressions from text.

For example, Chklovski and Pantel (2004) loosely define ENABLEMENT as a relation that holds between two verbs V1 and V2 when the pair can be glossed as V1 is accomplished by V2 and gives two examples: assess: :review and accomplish: :complete. $$$$$ This relation holds between two verbs V1 and V2 when the pair can be glossed as V1 is accomplished by V2.

Additionally, a wide variety of relationship-specific classifiers have been proposed, including pattern-based classifiers for hy ponyms (Hearst, 1992) ,meronyms (Girju, 2003), synonyms (Lin et al, 2003), a variety of verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), and general purpose analogy relations (Turney et al, 2003). $$$$$ Additional manually constructed resources include PropBank (Kingsbury et al. 2002), FrameNet (Baker et al.
