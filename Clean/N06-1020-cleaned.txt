We should keep in mind that (1) a tree bank PCFG is not state-of-the-art: its performance is mediocre compared to e.g. Bod (2003) or McClosky et al (2006), and (2) that our tree bank PCFG is binarized as in Klein and Manning (2005) to make results comparable. $$$$$ Finally, there are “unsupervised” strategies where no data is labeled and all annotations (including the grammar itself) must be discovered (Klein and Manning, 2002).

We note that the performance is on the same level as the performance of self-trained parsers, except for McClosky et al. (2006), which is based on the combination of reranking and self-training. $$$$$ As Figure 2 makes clear, the relative performance of the self-trained and baseline parsers does not self-trained parser improve the parse with the highest probability vary linearly with sentence length, so we introduced binned sentence length (with each bin of length 10) as a factor.
We note that the performance is on the same level as the performance of self-trained parsers, except for McClosky et al. (2006), which is based on the combination of reranking and self-training. $$$$$ Because the self-trained and baseline parsers produced equivalent output on 3,346 (66%) of the sentences, we restricted attention to the 1,693 sentences on which the self-trained and baseline parsers’ fscores differ.

In contrast, McClosky et al (2006a) report improved accuracy through self-training for a two stage parser and re-ranker. $$$$$ It is not surprising that self-training is not normally effective: Charniak (1997) and Steedman et al.

McClosky et al (2006) presented a very effective method for self-training a two-stage parsing system consisting of a first-stage generative lexicalized parser and a second-stage discriminative reranker. $$$$$ The second stage of our parser is a Maximum Entropy reranker, as described in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).

Although our models are based on purely generative PCFG grammars, our best product model performs competitively to the self-trained two-step discriminative reranking parser of McClosky et al (2006), which makes use of many non-local reranking features. $$$$$ In these cases, we will use the term reranking parser.

We expect that replacing the first-step generative parsing model in McClosky et al (2006) with a product of latent variable grammars would give even higher parsing accuracies. $$$$$ Gildea (2001) and Bacchiani et al. (2006) show that out-of-domain training data can improve parsing accuracy.

Our work is related to self-training (McClosky et al, 2006a; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007) as the algorithm used its own tagging of the sentences collected from the web in order to produce a better final tagging. $$$$$ Clark et al.

SELF-CRF: Following the self-training paradigm (e.g., (McClosky et al, 2006b; McClosky et al, 2006a)), we train our baseline first on the training set, then apply it to the test set, then retrain it on the training set plus the automatically labeled test set. $$$$$ When one learner is confident of its predictions about the data, we apply the predicted label of the data to the training set of the other learners.

To produce this, we segment sentences with MXTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and parse the corpus with the self trained Charniak parser (McClosky et al, 2006). $$$$$ Examples of this include self-training (Charniak, 1997) and co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Steedman et al., 2003).
