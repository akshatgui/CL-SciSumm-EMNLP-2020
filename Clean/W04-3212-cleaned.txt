Syntactic frame as described by Xue and Palmer (2004) Table 3. $$$$$ Most of these systems generally take as input a syntactic parse tree and use the syntactic information as features to tag the syntactic constituents with semantic role labels.

The candidate argument extraction method used for the FrameNet data, (as mentioned in 4) was adapted from the algorithm of Xue and Palmer (2004) applied to dependency trees. $$$$$ The availability of semantically annotated corpora such as the Proposition Banks (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2003) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) have enabled the development of a rapidly growing list of statistical semantic analyzers (Giidea and Jurafsky, 2002; Giidea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004; Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Palmer et al., submitted).
The candidate argument extraction method used for the FrameNet data, (as mentioned in 4) was adapted from the algorithm of Xue and Palmer (2004) applied to dependency trees. $$$$$ They did not report results that use automatic parses with this version of the data, but using a previous version of the data, they reported an fscore of 79.4% using automatic parses (Charniak, 2001).

For PropBank we use the algorithm of Xue and Palmer (2004) applied to dependency trees. $$$$$ 2 The PropBank and Semantic Role Labeling The PropBank adds a layer of semantic annotation to the Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994) to capture generalizations that are not adequately represented in the treebank parse trees.
For PropBank we use the algorithm of Xue and Palmer (2004) applied to dependency trees. $$$$$ Based on these considerations, we will adopt a three-stage architecture: Stage 1: To save training time, we use a simple algorithm to filter out constituents that are clearly not semantic arguments to the predicate in question.

Also, we considered some of the features designed by (Pradhan et al, 2005): First and Last Word/POS in Constituent, Subcategorization, Head Word of Prepositional Phrases and the Syntactic Frame feature from (Xue and Palmer, 2004). $$$$$ It is clear that the syntactic frame feature results in the most improvement (more than 1.7%) over the baseline, with the head of the PP parent feature being a close second.

Hence we now prune our set, by keeping only the siblings of all of the verb's ancestors, as is common in supervised SRL (Xue and Palmer, 2004). $$$$$ This means a fixed set of roles are specified for each verb and a different label is assigned to each role.
Hence we now prune our set, by keeping only the siblings of all of the verb's ancestors, as is common in supervised SRL (Xue and Palmer, 2004). $$$$$ Each sense of this verb is likely to be realized in a set of distinct subcategorization frames and is therefore called a frameset.

The baseline feature set is a combination of features introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and ones proposed in Pradhan et al, (2004), Surdeanu et al., (2003) and the syntactic-frame feature proposed in (Xue and Palmer, 2004). $$$$$ The availability of semantically annotated corpora such as the Proposition Banks (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2003) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) have enabled the development of a rapidly growing list of statistical semantic analyzers (Giidea and Jurafsky, 2002; Giidea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004; Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Palmer et al., submitted).

For example, Xue and Palmer (2004) reported that SRL performance dropped more than 10% when they used syntactic features from an automatic parser instead of the gold standard parsing trees. $$$$$ Standard accuracy, CS (f) = Cold Standard fscore, CP = Collins Parser Feature performance Table 3 shows the performance of the new features.

In order to reduce the number of candidate arguments in the identification step, I apply the filtering technique of Xue and Palmer (2004), trivially adopted to the dependency syntax formalism. $$$$$ That is, an argument marked with the same number, e.g.

To save time, we use a pruning stage (Xue and Palmer, 2004) to filter out the constituents that are clearly not semantic arguments to the predicate. $$$$$ Based on these considerations, we will adopt a three-stage architecture: Stage 1: To save training time, we use a simple algorithm to filter out constituents that are clearly not semantic arguments to the predicate in question.

Xue and Palmer (2004) did very encouraging work on the feature calibration of semantic role labeling. $$$$$ Calibrating Features For Semantic Role Labeling
Xue and Palmer (2004) did very encouraging work on the feature calibration of semantic role labeling. $$$$$ The shared task of the CoNLL-2004 is devoted to semantic role labeling (Carreras and Marquez, 2004).

Though several pruning algorithms have been raised (Xue and Palmer, 2004), the policies are all in global style. In this paper, a statistical analysis of Penn Prop Bank indicates that arguments are limited in a local syntax sub-tree rather than a whole one. $$$$$ This paper is organized as follows.
Though several pruning algorithms have been raised (Xue and Palmer, 2004), the policies are all in global style. In this paper, a statistical analysis of Penn Prop Bank indicates that arguments are limited in a local syntax sub-tree rather than a whole one. $$$$$ One is that for a given verb, the majority of the constituents in a syntactic tree are not its semantic arguments.

This is from a general belief that each step requires a different set of features (Xue and Palmer, 2004), and training these steps in a pipeline takes less time than training them as a joint-inference task. $$$$$ Based on these considerations, we will adopt a three-stage architecture: Stage 1: To save training time, we use a simple algorithm to filter out constituents that are clearly not semantic arguments to the predicate in question.

To reduce the complexity, Zhao et al (2009) reformulated a pruning algorithm introduced by Xue and Palmer (2004) for dependency structure by considering only direct dependents of a predicate and its ancestors as argument candidates. $$$$$ The availability of semantically annotated corpora such as the Proposition Banks (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2003) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) have enabled the development of a rapidly growing list of statistical semantic analyzers (Giidea and Jurafsky, 2002; Giidea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004; Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Palmer et al., submitted).

Note that this pruning algorithm is slightly different from that of (Xue and Palmer, 2004), the predicate itself is also included in the argument candidate list as the nominal predicate sometimes takes itself as its argument. $$$$$ Step 1: Designate the predicate as the current node and collect its sisters (constituents attached at the same level as the predicate) unless its sisters are coordinated with the predicate.

The effectiveness of the proposed additional pruning techniques may be seen as a significant improvement over the original algorithm of (Xue and Palmer, 2004). $$$$$ The baseline system uses the original features proposed in (Giidea and Palmer, 2002) and each row shows the improvement over the baseline when that feature is added to the baseline features.

For our baseline SRL model, we adopt the features used in other state-of-the-art SRL systems, which include the seven baseline features from the original work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) ,additional features taken from Pradhan et al (2005), and feature combinations which are inspired by the system in Xue and Palmer (2004). $$$$$ For comparison purposes we ignore the frameset information for now, following the practice of Gildea and Palmer (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2003) and others.
