Due to the recent availability of large text corpora, various statistical approaches have been tried including using 1) parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1990), (Brown et al., 1991), (Brown, 1997), 2) non-parallel bilingual corpora tagged with topic area (Yamabana et al., 1998) and 3) un-tagged mono-language corpora in the target language (Dagan and Itai, 1994), (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), (Kikui, 1998). $$$$$ 2 A similar observation underlies the use of parallel bilingual corpora for sense disambiguation (Brown et al. 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992).

Dagan and Itai (1994) have also addressed the lexical selection problem from the TL point of view. $$$$$ From the point of view of machine translation, we suggest that some ambiguity problems are easier to solve at the level of the target language than the source language.
Dagan and Itai (1994) have also addressed the lexical selection problem from the TL point of view. $$$$$ From a theoretical point of view, the mapping of syntactic relations is more problematic.

We used two measurements, applicability and precision (Dagan and Itai 1994), to evaluate the performance of our method. $$$$$ To evaluate the proposed disambiguation method, we implemented and tested the method on a random set of examples.

In addition, (Dagan and Itai, 1994) and (Li, 2002) propose using two monolingual corpora for word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ Word Sense Disambiguation Using A Second Language Monolingual Corpus
In addition, (Dagan and Itai, 1994) and (Li, 2002) propose using two monolingual corpora for word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ In addition, a larger monolingual corpus, of size n, is required, to provide enough training examples of typical contexts for each sense.

The idea of obtaining linguistic information about a text in one language by exploiting parallel or comparable texts in another language has been explored in the field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) since the early 90's, the most representative works being (Brown et al, 1991), (Gale et al, 1992), and (Dagan and Itai, 1994). $$$$$ 2 A similar observation underlies the use of parallel bilingual corpora for sense disambiguation (Brown et al. 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992).

Note that, unlike Dagan and Itai (1994), we give no consideration to statistical confidence as we are after 100% recall, whatever the cost to precision. $$$$$ We will incorporate this consideration into the decision algorithm by using confidence intervals.'

It may, therefore, be desirable to apply a dynamic threshold on the discriminative ratio (cf. (Dagan and Itai, 1994)) to accept only those translation pairs with sufficiently high statistical confidence, for example. $$$$$ Consequently, we shall use a dynamic threshold for 151 /1112, which is large when the counts are small and decreases as the counts increase.
It may, therefore, be desirable to apply a dynamic threshold on the discriminative ratio (cf. (Dagan and Itai, 1994)) to accept only those translation pairs with sufficiently high statistical confidence, for example. $$$$$ As mentioned above, our motivation was to find a criterion that depends on a dynamic threshold for 151 //52 (or alternatively ni /n2), so that the threshold will be higher when ni and n2 are smaller.

However, most of previous research has focused on using multilingual resources typically used in SMT systems to improve WSD accuracy Dagan and Itai (1994). $$$$$ In contrast to this view, previous approaches in machine translation typically resolve examples like (1) by stating various constraints in terms of the source language (Nirenburg 1987).
However, most of previous research has focused on using multilingual resources typically used in SMT systems to improve WSD accuracy Dagan and Itai (1994). $$$$$ Thus, the success rate for the test sentences is the same for both methods, while requiring a considerably smaller amount of resources at the research phase.

For example, Dagan and Itai (1994) carried out WSD experiments using monolingual corpora, a bilingual lexicon and a parser for the source language. $$$$$ The presented algorithm identifies syntactic relations between words, using a source language parser, and maps the alternative interpretations of these relations to the target language, using a bilingual lexicon.

Dagan and Itai (1994) indicate that two languages are more informative than one; an English corpus is very helpful in disambiguating polysemous words in Hebrew text. $$$$$ This is where other languages can supply the solution, exploiting the fact that the mapping between words and word senses varies significantly between different languages.
Dagan and Itai (1994) indicate that two languages are more informative than one; an English corpus is very helpful in disambiguating polysemous words in Hebrew text. $$$$$ This process requires a bilingual lexicon that maps each Hebrew sense separately into its possible translations, similar to a Hebrew—Hebrew—English lexicon (analogous to the Oxford English—English—Hebrew dictionary of Hornby et al. [1986], which lists the senses of an English word, along with the possible Hebrew translations for each of them).

The work of (Dagan and Itai, 1994) has also successfully used WSD to improve the accuracy of machine translation. $$$$$ A related task in machine translation, on which we focus in this paper, is target word selection.
The work of (Dagan and Itai, 1994) has also successfully used WSD to improve the accuracy of machine translation. $$$$$ To improve the performance of target word selection further, our method may be combined with other sense disambiguation methods.

As in (Dagan and Itai, 1994), we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence. $$$$$ Hence, the results we report measure the performance of just the target word selection module and not the performance of a complete translation system.
As in (Dagan and Itai, 1994), we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence. $$$$$ In this section we quote their results, providing additional evidence for the effectiveness of the TWS method.

(Dagan and Itai, 1994) explicitly suggests performing word sense disambiguation in the target language (English in the article) with the goal of resolving ambiguity in the source language (Hebrew). $$$$$ We must make this assumption since we use only a target language corpus, which is not related to any source language information.6 Therefore, when seeing an occurrence of the target language word w, we do not know which source language word is appropriate in the current context.
