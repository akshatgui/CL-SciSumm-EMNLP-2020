More recently, Bean and Riloff (1999) proposed methods for autolnatically extracting from a corpus such special predicates, i.e., heads that correlate well with discourse novelty. $$$$$ Using a training corpus, we create a list of presumably existential NPs by collecting the first sentence of every text and extracting all definite NPs that were not classified by the syntactic heuristics.

Bean and Riloff (1999) developed a system for identifying discourse-new DDs that incorporates, in addition to syntax-based heuristics aimed at recognizing predicative and established DDs using post modification heuristics similar to those used by Vieira and Poesio, additional techniques for mining from corpora unfamiliar DDs including proper names, larger situation, and semantically functional. $$$$$ We also developed syntactic heuristics to recognize referential NPs.

More recently, the problem has been tackled using unsupervised (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)) and supervised (e.g., Evans (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002a)) approaches. $$$$$ The problem with this approach is that a large number of DE's may not have antecedents.
More recently, the problem has been tackled using unsupervised (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)) and supervised (e.g., Evans (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002a)) approaches. $$$$$ Using this measure, our algorithm achieved 81.8% recall with 85.6% precision using Va, and achieved 82.9% recall with 83.5% precision using Vb.

Bean and Riloff (1999) extracts rules from non-anaphoric noun phrases and noun phrases patterns, which are then applied to test data to identify existential noun phrases. $$$$$ Corpus-Based Identification Of Non-Anaphoric Noun Phrases
Bean and Riloff (1999) extracts rules from non-anaphoric noun phrases and noun phrases patterns, which are then applied to test data to identify existential noun phrases. $$$$$ Our algorithm generates lists of nonanaphoric noun phrases and noun phrase patterns from a training corpus and uses them to recognize non-anaphoric noun phrases in new texts.

In previous work (Bean and Riloff, 1999), we developed an unsupervised learning algorithm that automatically recognizes definite NPs that are existential without syntactic modification because their meaning is universally understood. $$$$$ We also developed syntactic heuristics to recognize referential NPs.

Using this heuristic, BABAR identifies existential definite NPs in the training corpus using our previous learning algorithm (Bean and Riloff, 1999) and resolves all occurrences of the same existential NP with each another. $$$$$ Once the methods had been trained, we classified each definite NP in the test set as referential or existential using the algorithm in Figure 5.
Using this heuristic, BABAR identifies existential definite NPs in the training corpus using our previous learning algorithm (Bean and Riloff, 1999) and resolves all occurrences of the same existential NP with each another. $$$$$ We have developed several methods for auto-matically identifying existential noun phrases using a training corpus.

First, a non-anaphoric NP classifier identifies definite noun phrases that are existential, using both syntactic rules and our learned existential NP recognizer (Bean and Riloff, 1999), and removes them from the resolution process. $$$$$ We will refer to non-anaphoric definite noun phrases as existential NPs (Allen, 1995).
First, a non-anaphoric NP classifier identifies definite noun phrases that are existential, using both syntactic rules and our learned existential NP recognizer (Bean and Riloff, 1999), and removes them from the resolution process. $$$$$ A more recent system (Vieira and Poesio, 1997) recognizes a large percentage of nonanaphoric definite noun phrases (NPs) during the coreference resolution process through the use of syntactic cues and case-sensitive rules.

Bean and Riloff (1999) and Uryupina (2003) construct quite accurate classifiers to detect unique NPs. $$$$$ We first classified definite NPs into two broad categories, referential NPs, which have prior referents in the texts, and existential NPs, which do not.
Bean and Riloff (1999) and Uryupina (2003) construct quite accurate classifiers to detect unique NPs. $$$$$ This set of NPs does not correspond exactly to our definition of existential NPs because we consider associative NPs to be existential and they do not.

The system described in (Bean and Riloff, 1999) also makes use of syntactic heuristics. $$$$$ We also developed syntactic heuristics to recognize referential NPs.
The system described in (Bean and Riloff, 1999) also makes use of syntactic heuristics. $$$$$ First, we evaluated each method independently (on top of the syntactic heuristics).

For the statistics-based approaches, Bean and Riloff (1999) developed a statistics-based method for automatically identifying existential definite NPs which are non-anaphoric. $$$$$ Corpus-Based Identification Of Non-Anaphoric Noun Phrases
For the statistics-based approaches, Bean and Riloff (1999) developed a statistics-based method for automatically identifying existential definite NPs which are non-anaphoric. $$$$$ We have developed a corpus-based algorithm for automatically identifying definite noun phrases that are non-anaphoric, which has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of coreference resolution systems.

Bean and Riloff (1999) and Uryupina (2003) have already employed a definite probability measure in a similar way, although the way the ratio is computed is slightly different. $$$$$ We used the definite probability measure as a way of detecting errors in the Si and EHP lists.
Bean and Riloff (1999) and Uryupina (2003) have already employed a definite probability measure in a similar way, although the way the ratio is computed is slightly different. $$$$$ Although the syntactic heuristics are a reliable way to identify existential definite NPs, they miss 57% of the true existentials.

A more fine-grained distinction is made by Bean and Riloff (1999) and Vieira and Poesio (2000) to distinguish restrictive from non-restrictive post modification by ommitting those modifiers that occur between commas, which should not be classified as chain starting. $$$$$ We began by building a set of syntactic heuristics that look for the structural cues of restrictive premodification and restrictive postmodification.

We borrow the idea of classifying definites occurring in the first sentence as chain starting from Bean and Riloff (1999). $$$$$ That is, suppose &quot;the F.B.I.&quot; appears in both sentence 1 and sentence 7 of a text.
We borrow the idea of classifying definites occurring in the first sentence as chain starting from Bean and Riloff (1999). $$$$$ As a baseline measurement, we considered the accuracy of classifying every definite NP as existential.

 $$$$$ This paper details our method for identifying existential NPs that are understood through general world knowledge.
 $$$$$ Given the large percentage of non-anaphoric discourse entities handled by most coreference resolvers, we believe that using a system like ours to filter existential NPs has the potential to reduce processing time and complexity and improve the accuracy of coreference resolution.

An anaphoricity feature indicates whether an NP to be resolved is anaphoric, and is typically computed using an anaphoricity classifier (Ng, 2004), hand-crafted patterns (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005), and automatically acquired patterns (Bean and Riloff, 1999). $$$$$ By using the Si extractions as input to a pattern generation algorithm, we built a set of Existential Head Patterns (EHPs) that identify such constructions.

Non-anaphoric definite descriptions have been detected using heuristics (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)) and unsupervised methods (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)). $$$$$ Earlier work found that nearly 50% of definite descriptions had no prior referents (Vieira and Poesio, 1997), and we found that number to be even higher, 63%, in our corpus.
Non-anaphoric definite descriptions have been detected using heuristics (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)) and unsupervised methods (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)). $$$$$ But other definite descriptions are non-anaphoric because readers understand their meaning due to common knowledge.
