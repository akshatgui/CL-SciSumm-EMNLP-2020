We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988) or DeRose (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to~in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to~to. $$$$$ Consider the following three examples where pronunciation depends on part of speech.

This work is to be distinguished from supervised part-of-speech disambiguation systems, which use labeled training data (Church, 1988), unsupervised disambiguation systems, which use a dictionary of possible tags for each word (Merialdo, 1994), or prototype driven systems which use a small set of prototypes for each class (Haghighi and Klein, 2006). $$$$$ Recall that precedence parsing makes use of a table that says whether to insert an open or close bracket between any two categories (terminal or nonterminal).

Much of this work offers the prospect that a disambiguation system might be able to input unrestricted text and tag each word with the most likely sense with fairly reasonable accuracy and efficiency, just as part of speech taggers (e.g., Church (1988)) can now input unrestricted text and assign each word with the most likely part of speech with fairly reasonable accuracy and efficiency. $$$$$ A Stochastic Parts Program And Noun Phrase Parser For Unrestricted Text

Church's Parts of speech [Church, 1988] performs not only part-of-speech analysis, but it also identities the most simple kinds of noun phrases mostly sequences of determiners, premodifiers and nominal heads by inserting brackets around them. $$$$$ Similar stochastic methods have been applied to locate simple noun phrases with very high accuracy.

Several approaches provide similar output based on statistics (Church 1988, Zhai 1997, for example), a finite-state machine (AitMokhtar and Chanod 1997), or a hybrid approach combining statistics and linguistic rules (Voutilainen and Padro 1997). $$$$$ One might have thought that ngram models weren't adequate for the task since it is wellknown that they are inadequate for determining grammaticality

As we said at the out 211 set, we don't necessarily believe HunPos to be in any way better than TnT, and certainly the main ideas have been pioneered by DeRose (1988), Church (1988), and others long before this generation of HMM work. $$$$$ Consider the following pair described in [Marcus]

Instead of employing the source-channel paradigm for tagging (more or less explicitly present e.g. in (Merialdo, 1992), (Church, 1988), (Hajji, Hladk~, 1997)) used in the past (notwithstanding some exceptions, such as Maximum Entropy and rule-based taggers), we are using here a direct approach to modeling, for which we have chosen an exponential probabilistic model. $$$$$ The proposed stochastic approach is largely compatible with this; the proposed approach 1.

Regardless of whether one is using HMMs, maximum entropy conditional sequence models, or other techniques like decision trees, most systems work in one direction through the sequence (normally left to right, but occasionally right to left ,e.g., Church (1988)). $$$$$ In the case of the Brown Tagged Corpus, the lexical entropy, the conditional entropy of the part of speech given the word is about 0.25 bits per part of speech.

Termight uses a part of speech tagger (Church, 1988) to identify a list of candidate terms which is then filtered by a manual pass. $$$$$ The program uses a linear time dynamic programming algorithm to find an assignment of parts of speech to words that optimizes the product of (a) lexical probabilities (probability of observing part of speech i given word j), and (b) contextual probabilities (probability of observing part of speech i given k previous parts of speech).
