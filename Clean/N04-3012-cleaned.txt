Work based on WordNet-like lexical networks for building semantic similarity measures such as (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) or (Pedersen et al, 2004) falls into this category. $$$$$ It provides six measures of similarity, and three measures of relatedness, all of which are based on the lexical database WordNet.

SR-AW finds the sense of each word that is most related or most similar to those of its neighbors in the sentence, according to any of the ten measures available in WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al, 2004). $$$$$ However, concepts can be related in many ways beyond being similar to each other.
SR-AW finds the sense of each word that is most related or most similar to those of its neighbors in the sentence, according to any of the ten measures available in WordNet::Similarity (Pedersen et al, 2004). $$$$$ The premise behind this algorithm is that the sense of a word can be determined by finding which of its senses is most related to the possible senses of its neighbors.

Then the value of vi is assigned as follows, where the similarity function SIM (ti ,wj) is calculated according to the path measure (Pedersen et al., 2004) using the WordNet. $$$$$ Three similarity measures are based on path lengths between a pair of concepts: lch (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), wup (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and path. lch finds the shortest path between two concepts, and scales that value by the maximum path length found in the is–a hierarchy in which they occur. wup finds the depth of the LCS of the concepts, and then scales that by the sum of the depths of the individual concepts.
Then the value of vi is assigned as follows, where the similarity function SIM (ti ,wj) is calculated according to the path measure (Pedersen et al., 2004) using the WordNet. $$$$$ The measure path is a baseline that is equal to the inverse of the shortest path between two concepts.

The measures vary from simple edge-counting to attempt to factor in peculiarities of the network structure by considering link direction, relative path, and density, such as vector, lesk, hso, lch, wup, path, res, lin and jcn (Pedersen et al, 2004). $$$$$ Three similarity measures are based on path lengths between a pair of concepts: lch (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), wup (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and path. lch finds the shortest path between two concepts, and scales that value by the maximum path length found in the is–a hierarchy in which they occur. wup finds the depth of the LCS of the concepts, and then scales that by the sum of the depths of the individual concepts.

We use the WordNet word-to-word similarity metrics (Pedersen et al, 2004) and Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al, 2007). $$$$$ (McCarthy et al., 2004) use it in conjunction with a thesaurus derived from raw text in order to automatically identify the predominent sense of a word.
