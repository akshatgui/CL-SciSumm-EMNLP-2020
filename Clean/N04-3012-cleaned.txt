Extensive research concerning the integration of semantic knowledge into NLP for the English language has been arguably fostered by the emergence of WordNet $$$$$ WordNet

Work based on WordNet-like lexical networks for building semantic similarity measures such as (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) or (Pedersen et al, 2004) falls into this category. $$$$$ It provides six measures of similarity, and three measures of relatedness, all of which are based on the lexical database WordNet.
Work based on WordNet-like lexical networks for building semantic similarity measures such as (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006) or (Pedersen et al, 2004) falls into this category. $$$$$ Our work with measures of semantic similarity and relatedness began while adapting the Lesk Algorithm for word sense disambiguation to WordNet (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2002).

For replacement using semantic similarity measures, we used WordNet $$$$$ WordNet

We use the Lesk (overlap) similarity as implemented by the WordNet $$$$$ WordNet

SR-AW finds the sense of each word that is most related or most similar to those of its neighbors in the sentence, according to any of the ten measures available in WordNet $$$$$ However, concepts can be related in many ways beyond being similar to each other.
SR-AW finds the sense of each word that is most related or most similar to those of its neighbors in the sentence, according to any of the ten measures available in WordNet $$$$$ The premise behind this algorithm is that the sense of a word can be determined by finding which of its senses is most related to the possible senses of its neighbors.

Then the value of vi is assigned as follows, where the similarity function SIM (ti ,wj) is calculated according to the path measure (Pedersen et al., 2004) using the WordNet. $$$$$ Three similarity measures are based on path lengths between a pair of concepts

We used the Wordnet $$$$$ WordNet

The measures vary from simple edge-counting to attempt to factor in peculiarities of the network structure by considering link direction, relative path, and density, such as vector, lesk, hso, lch, wup, path, res, lin and jcn (Pedersen et al, 2004). $$$$$ Three similarity measures are based on path lengths between a pair of concepts

We use the WordNet word-to-word similarity metrics (Pedersen et al, 2004) and Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al, 2007). $$$$$ (McCarthy et al., 2004) use it in conjunction with a thesaurus derived from raw text in order to automatically identify the predominent sense of a word.

 $$$$$ The lin and jcn measures augment the information content of the LCS with the sum of the information content of concepts A and B themselves.

For example, WordNet similarities (Pedersen et al, 2004) or Latent Semantic Analysis over a large corpus are widely used in many applications and for the definition of kernel functions. $$$$$ However, there are also utility programs available with WordNet

It is worth mentioning that the LSA similarity measure depends on the selected corpus but it benefits from a higher computation speed in comparison to the construction of the similarity matrix based on the WordNet Similarity package (Pedersen et al, 2004). $$$$$ WordNet

Additionally, we used the Jiang&Conrath (J&C) distance (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) computed with wn $$$$$ WordNet

Moreover, Table 4 shows that the computation of the LSA matrix on Wikipedia is faster than using the WordNet similarity software (Pedersen et al, 2004). $$$$$ WordNet
