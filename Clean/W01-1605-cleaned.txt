The additional two systems were: PD-EDU: Same as EDU except using the perfect discourse trees, available from the RST corpus (Carlson et al, 2001). $$$$$ We decided to use RST for three reasons: can play a crucial role in building natural language generation systems (Novy, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore, 1995) and text summarization systems (Marcu, 2000); can be used to increase the naturalness of machine translation outputs (Marcu et al. 2000); and can be used to build essayscoring systems that provide students with discourse-based feedback (Burstein et al., 2001).

We experimentally evaluated the test collection for single document summarization contained in the RST Discourse Treebank (RSTDTB) (Carlsonetal., 2001) distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). $$$$$ Two essential considerations from the outset were that the corpus needed to be consistently annotated, and that it would be made publicly available through the Linguistic Data Consortium for a nominal fee to cover distribution costs.

Two of the main corpora with discourse annotations are the RST Discourse Treebank (RSTDT) (Carlson et al., 2001) and the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al, 2008a), which are both based on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. $$$$$ The resulting corpus contains 385 documents of American English selected from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), annotated in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory.

In the Cause versus Contrast case, their reported performance exceeds ours significantly; however, in a subset of their experiments which test Cause versus Contrast on instances from the human annotated RSTBank corpus (Carlson et al., 2001) where no cue phrase is present, they report only 63% accuracy over a 56% baseline (the baseline is $$$$$ The 78 relations used in annotating the corpus can be partitioned into 16 classes that share some type of rhetorical meaning: Attribution, Background, Cause, Comparison, Condition, Contrast, Elaboration, Enablement, Evaluation, Explanation, Joint, Manner-Means, Topic-Comment, Summary, Temporal, TopicChange.

 $$$$$ In addition, three relations are used to impose structure on the tree: textualorganization, span, and same-unit (used to link parts of units separated by embedded units or spans).
 $$$$$ The added value of multiple layers of overt linguistic phenomena enhancing the Penn Treebank information can be exploited to advance the study of discourse, to enhance language technologies such as text summarization, machine translation or information retrieval, or to be a testbed for new and creative natural language processing techniques.

For the first, the labelled/unlabelled relations f scores are 50.3% /73.0% and for the latter, they are 75.3% /84.0%: this is similar to the performance on other discourse annotation projects, e.g., Carlson et al (2001). $$$$$ So far, the annotation of discourse structure of documents has been applied primarily to identifying topical segments (Hearst, 1997), inter-sentential relations (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 1999; Tsâ€™ou et al., 2000), and hierarchical analyses of small corpora (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu et al., 1999).

The generator is informed by a corpus study of embedded discourse units on two discourse annotated corpora: the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001) and the Penn Discourse Treebank. $$$$$ The resulting corpus contains 385 documents of American English selected from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), annotated in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory.

We evaluate DPLP on the RST Discourse Tree bank (Carlson et al, 2001), comparing against state-of-the-art results. $$$$$ Syntactic checking involved ensuring that the tree had a single root node and comparing the tree to the document to check for missing sentences or fragments from the end of the text.

To compare with previous works on RSTDT, we use the 18 coarse-grained relations defined in (Carlson et al, 2001). $$$$$ The kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) has been used extensively in previous empirical studies of discourse (Carletta et al., 1997; Flammia and Zue, 1995; Passonneau and Litman, 1997).
To compare with previous works on RSTDT, we use the 18 coarse-grained relations defined in (Carlson et al, 2001). $$$$$ Because the RST theory does not differentiate between different levels of the tree structure, a fairly fine-grained set of relations operates between EDUs and EDU clusters at the macrolevel.

(Carlson et al 2001) reported relatively high levels of inter-annotator agreement, this was based on an annotation procedure where the annotators were allowed to iteratively revise the instructions based on joint discussion. $$$$$ We tracked inter-annotator agreement during each phase of the project, using a method developed by Marcu et al. (1999) for computing kappa statistics over hierarchical structures.

If no cue phrases are used to signal the relation between two elementary discourse units, an automatic discourse labeler can at best guess that an ELABORATION relation holds between the units, because ELABORATION relations are the most frequently used relations (Carlson et al, 2001). $$$$$ Once the elementary units of discourse have been determined, adjacent spans are linked together via rhetorical relations creating a hierarchical structure.
