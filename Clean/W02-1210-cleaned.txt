The grammars used for the experiments reported here are the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger (2000)) and JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002), precision grammars of English and Japanese, respectively. $$$$$ The attributevalue matrix of a sign in the Japanese BPSG is quite similar to a sign in the LinGO English Resource Grammar (henceforth ERG) (Flickinger 2000), with information about the orthographical realization of the lexical sign in PHON, syntactic and semantic information in SYNSEM, information about the lexical status in LEX, nonlocal information in NONLOC, head information that goes up the tree in HEAD and information about subcategorization in SUBCAT.

The Grammar Matrix was developed initially on the basis of broad coverage grammars for English (Flickinger, 2000) and Japanese (Siegel and Bender, 2002), and has since been extended and refined as it has been used in the development of broad-coverage grammars for Norwegian (Hellan and Haugereid, 2003), ModernGreek (Kordoni and Neu, 2005), and Spanish (Marimon et al, 2007), as well as being applied to 42 other languages from a variety of language families in a classroom context (Bender, 2007). $$$$$ In this paper, we describe the development of a broad coverage grammar for Japanese that is used in an automatic email response application.
