 $$$$$ Using this mechanism, it is possible to control the sequence of verbal endings: Verb stems select verbal endings via SPEC and take no SPR, derivational morphemes (like causative or potential) select tense endings or other derivational morphemes via MARK and subcategorize for verb stems and/or verb endings via SPR (sase takes only verb stems), and tense endings take verb stems or endings as SPR and take no MARK or SPEC (as they occur at the end of the sequence).
 $$$$$ Initial evaluation of the grammar on new domains and the growth curve of grammar coverage should bear this out.

By using a Japanese grammar (JACY: Siegel and Bender (2002)) based on a monostratal theory of grammar (HPSG: Pollard and Sag (1994)) we could simultaneously annotate syntactic and semantic structure without overburdening the annotator. $$$$$ The grammar is couched in the theoretical framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard & Sag 1994), with semantic representations in Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al. 2001).

The grammars used for the experiments reported here are the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger (2000)) and JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002), precision grammars of English and Japanese, respectively. $$$$$ The attributevalue matrix of a sign in the Japanese BPSG is quite similar to a sign in the LinGO English Resource Grammar (henceforth ERG) (Flickinger 2000), with information about the orthographical realization of the lexical sign in PHON, syntactic and semantic information in SYNSEM, information about the lexical status in LEX, nonlocal information in NONLOC, head information that goes up the tree in HEAD and information about subcategorization in SUBCAT.

In this paper, we explore the utility of different evaluation metrics at predicting parse performance through a series of experiments over two broad coverage grammars: the English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger (2000)) and JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002). $$$$$ In this paper, we describe the development of a broad coverage grammar for Japanese that is used in an automatic email response application.

The Grammar Matrix was developed initially on the basis of broad coverage grammars for English (Flickinger, 2000) and Japanese (Siegel and Bender, 2002), and has since been extended and refined as it has been used in the development of broad-coverage grammars for Norwegian (Hellan and Haugereid, 2003), ModernGreek (Kordoni and Neu, 2005), and Spanish (Marimon et al, 2007), as well as being applied to 42 other languages from a variety of language families in a classroom context (Bender, 2007). $$$$$ In this paper, we describe the development of a broad coverage grammar for Japanese that is used in an automatic email response application.
