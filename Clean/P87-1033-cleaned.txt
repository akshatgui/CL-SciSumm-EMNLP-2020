It is well-known that disjunctive unification is NP complete (Kasper 1987). $$$$$ This result indicates, according to the widely accepted mathematical assumption that P NP, that any complete unification algorithm for disjunctive descriptions will require exponential time in the worst case.

The unification of disjunctive feature structures is implemented according to Kasper's algorithm (Kasper, 1987). $$$$$ A Unification Method For Disjunctive Feature Descriptions

The general problem of unifying two disjunctive feature structures is non-polynomial in the number of disjunctions (Kasper, 1987). $$$$$ In previous research [4,5] we have shown how descriptions of feature structures can be represented by a certain type of logical formula, and that the consistency problem for disjunctive descriptions is NP-complete.
The general problem of unifying two disjunctive feature structures is non-polynomial in the number of disjunctions (Kasper, 1987). $$$$$ The unification method presented here represents a general solution to a seemingly intractable problem.

There is reason to hope that this will often be the case; while disjunction may be widespread in grammar ules and texical entries, Kasper (1987) observes that in his implementation "in the analysis of a particular sentence most features have a unique value, and some features are not present at, all". $$$$$ The most common unification methods for non-disjunctive feature structures use a directed graph (DG) representation, in which arcs are labeled by names of features, and nodes correspond to values of features.

Kasper (1987) describes a technique which, for every set of n conjoined disjunctions, checks the consistency first of single disjuncts against the definite part of the description, then that of pairs and so on up ton-tuples for full consistency. $$$$$ Indefinite: a SET of disjunctions, where each disjunction is a SET of feature-descriptions.
Kasper (1987) describes a technique which, for every set of n conjoined disjunctions, checks the consistency first of single disjuncts against the definite part of the description, then that of pairs and so on up ton-tuples for full consistency. $$$$$ In step 3, NWISE-CONSISTENCY is used with 1 as the value of the parameter n. A new description is hypothesized by unifying disjunct (1) with the definite component of the description (i.e., NEW-DESC.DEFINITE).

This variation of the algorithm given in Kasper (1987) is closer to Propane's strategy, but the expansion to full DNF is itself in general an exponential process and will, when many disjunctions remain, be far more expensive than looking for a single realization. $$$$$ This method works reasonably well for small grammars, but it is clearly unsatisfactory for descriptions containing more than a small number of disjunctions, because the DNF expansion requires an amount of space which is exponential in the number of disjunctions.

Unification time here is order n log n in the sizes n of the input structures (Kasper, 1987). $$$$$ Its time complexity has an upper bound of 0(n log n).
Unification time here is order n log n in the sizes n of the input structures (Kasper, 1987). $$$$$ Thus, in the worst case, CHECKlNDEF requires 0(cen log n) time.
