Additionally, their aggregate decisions make use of Mintzstyle aggregate features (Mintz et al, 2009), that collect evidence from multiple sentences, while we use 543 Inputs: (1)?, a set of sentences, (2) E, a set of entities mentioned in the sentences, (3) R, a set of relation names, and (4)?, a database of atomic facts of the form r (e1 ,e2) for r? R and ei? E. $$$$$ Because our algorithm can use large amounts of unlabeled data, a pair of entities may occur multiple times in the test set.

Contrasted to the alternative approach where annotations are document-level only, this approach has a number of important benefits, such as allowing machine learning methods for event extraction to be directly trained on fully and specifically annotated data without the need to apply frequently error prone heuristics (Mintz et al, 2009) or develop machine learning methods addressing the mapping between text expressions and document-level annotations (Riedel et al, 2010). $$$$$ An alternative approach, purely unsupervised information extraction, extracts strings of words between entities in large amounts of text, and clusters and simplifies these word strings to produce relation-strings (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007).

We applied our method to Wikipedia articles using Freebase as a knowledge base and found that (i) our model identified patterns expressing a given relation more accurately than baseline methods and (ii) our method led to better extraction performance than the original DS (Mintz et al, 2009) and MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011), which is a state-of-the-art multi instance learning system for relation extraction (see Section 7). $$$$$ Distant supervision for relation extraction without labeled data
