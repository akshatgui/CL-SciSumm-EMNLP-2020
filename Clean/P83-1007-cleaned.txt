 $$$$$ We have said that each utterance S in a discourse has associated with it a backward-looking center, Cb(S), and a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(S).
 $$$$$ The differences between references at the global and local levels were discussed, and the interaction of the syntactic role of a given noun phrase and its semantic interpretation with centering was described.

Grosz et al (1983) proposed the centering model which is concerned with the interactions between the local coherence of discourse. $$$$$ The two levels of discourse coherence correspond to two of focusing—global centering.
Grosz et al (1983) proposed the centering model which is concerned with the interactions between the local coherence of discourse. $$$$$ Global coherence and focusing are major factors in the generation and interpretation of nonpronominal definite referring expressions.- Local coherence and centering have greater effect on the processing of pronominal expressions.

The proposed method employs contextual features based on centering theory (Grosz et al, 1983) as well as conventional syntactic and word-based features. $$$$$ Theories—and systems based on them--will generate unacceptable uses of referring expressions if they do not take these into 3.

To resolve referring expression, one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (Grosz et al (1983)). $$$$$ In contrast. centering refers to a more local focusing process, one relates to identifying the single entity that an individual utterance most centrally concerns (Sidner, 1979; Joshi and Weinstein, 19811.
