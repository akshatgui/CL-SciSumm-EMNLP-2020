The shared task of CoNLL-2002 dealt with named entity recognition for Spanish and Dutch (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2002 Shared Task

We do not undertake the problem of named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), but rather apply an existing NER system as a preprocessing step (Finkel et al, 2005). $$$$$ The annotator has followed the MITRE and SAIC guidelines for named entity recognition (Chinchor et al., 1999) as well as possible.
We do not undertake the problem of named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), but rather apply an existing NER system as a preprocessing step (Finkel et al, 2005). $$$$$ A boosted decision tree method obtained the best performance on both data sets (Carreras et al., 2002).

Empirical evidence for this argument can be seen from the result of the CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002) (Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder, 2003), where the ranking of the participating systems changes with the test corpora. $$$$$ Stages use the output of previous stages for obtaining an improved performance (Spanish test set

Similarly to classical NLP tasks such as base noun phrase chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) or named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate the mention detection problem as a classification problem, by assigning to each token in the text a label, indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions. $$$$$ The tagging scheme is a variant of the IOB scheme originally put forward by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).

It is especially challenging to extract the named entities from the text sources written in languages other than English which, in practice, is supported by the results of the shared tasks on the named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). $$$$$ We have described the CoNLL-2002 shared task

In addition, several competitions have been organized, with a focus on multilingual NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). $$$$$ Stages use the output of previous stages for obtaining an improved performance (Spanish test set

Various state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as Maximum Entropy (Borthwick, 1999), AdaBoost (Carreras et al., 2002), Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al,), Memory-based Based learning (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002b), have been used. $$$$$ The annotator has followed the MITRE and SAIC guidelines for named entity recognition (Chinchor et al., 1999) as well as possible.

Similarly to classical NLP tasks, such as Base Phrase Chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999) (BPC) or NER (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002), we formulate the MD task as a sequence classification problem, i.e. the classifier assigns to each token in the text a label indicating whether it starts a specific mention, is inside a specific mention, or is outside any mentions. $$$$$ The tagging scheme is a variant of the IOB scheme originally put forward by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).

We use the Dutch data set from the CoNLL 2002 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2002 Shared Task

The fourth type, called miscellaneous, was introduced in the CoNLL NER tasks in 2002 (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002) and 2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), and includes proper names falling outside the three classic types. $$$$$ The data contains entities of four types
