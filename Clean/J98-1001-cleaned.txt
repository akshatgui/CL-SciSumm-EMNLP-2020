Two of the fundamental components of a natural language communication are word sense discovery (Jones, 1986) and word sense disambiguation (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ In general terms, word sense disambiguation involves the association of a given word in a text or discourse with a definition or meaning (sense) which is distinguishable from other meanings potentially attributable to that word.
Two of the fundamental components of a natural language communication are word sense discovery (Jones, 1986) and word sense disambiguation (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Therefore, all work on sense disambiguation relies on the context of the target word to provide information to be used for its disambiguation.

Ide and Veronis (1998) present a very concise survey of the history of ideas used in word sense disambiguation; for a recent survey of the state-of-the-art one can refer to (Navigli, 2009). $$$$$ Introduction To The Special Issue On Word Sense Disambiguation

Several types of information are useful for WSD (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Very few studies have used Ide and Veronis Introduction information of all three types, and the focus in much recent work is on microcontext alone.
Several types of information are useful for WSD (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ However, to date there has been little systematic study Ide and Wronis Introduction of the contribution of different information types for different types of target words.

The NLP field has gone through a very long tradition of algorithms designed for solving this problem (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Given the progress that has been recently made in WSD research and the rapid development of methods for solving the problem, it is appropriate at this time to stand back and assess the state of the field and to consider the next steps that need to be taken.
The NLP field has gone through a very long tradition of algorithms designed for solving this problem (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Work on automatic WSD has a history as long as automated language processing generally.

Several efforts have been made to develop automatic WSD systems that can provide accurate sense tagging (Ide and Veronis, 1998), with a current emphasis on creating manually sense-tagged data for supervised training of statistical WSD systems, as evidenced by SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000) and SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001). $$$$$ SENSEVAL will likely take us a step closer to this understanding; at the least, it will force consideration of what can be meaningfully regarded as an isolatable sense distinction and provide some measure of the distance between the performance of current systems and a predefined standard.

Following Ide and Veronis (1998) we distinguish between data and knowledge-driven word sense disambiguation. $$$$$ Step (2), the assignment of words to senses, is accomplished by reliance on two major sources of information

Historically, after work on WSD had overcome so called early doubts (Ide and Veronis, 1998) in the 1960s, it was applied to various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, information retrieval, content and grammatical analysis and text processing. $$$$$ Work on word sense disambiguation continued throughout the next two decades in the framework of AI-based natural language understanding research, as well as in the fields of content analysis, stylistic . and literary analysis, and information retrieval.

In general, following Ide and Veronis (1998) the various WSD approaches of the past can be divided into two types, i.e., data and knowledge-based approaches. $$$$$ The following sections survey the approaches applied to date.

A great deal of research on WSD has been done over the past decade (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ (Veronis and Ide 1990).7 Experiments on 23 ambiguous words, each in six contexts (138 pairs of words), produced correct disambiguation, using the relatively fine sense distinctions in the CED, in 71.7% of the cases (three times better than chance

Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Very few studies have used Ide and Veronis Introduction information of all three types, and the focus in much recent work is on microcontext alone.
Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998). $$$$$ Local or &quot;micro&quot; context is generally considered to be some small window of words surrounding a word occurrence in a text or discourse, from a few words of context to the entire sentence in which the target word appears.

WSD is fundamental to natural language understanding and is a useful intermediate step for many other language processing tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998). $$$$$ Sense disambiguation is an &quot;intermediate task&quot; (Wilks and Stevenson 1996), which is not an end in itself, but rather is necessary at one level or another to accomplish most natural language processing tasks.
