Extending this notion, (Knight and Graehl, 1997) built five probability distributions:. $$$$$ Extending this notion, we settled down to build five probability distributions: Given a katakana string o observed by OCR, we want to find the English word sequence w that maximizes the sum, over all e, j, and k, of Following (Pereira et al.. 1994; Pereira and Riley, 1996), we implement P(w) in a weighted finite-state acceptor (WFSA) and we implement the other distributions in weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs).
Extending this notion, (Knight and Graehl, 1997) built five probability distributions:. $$$$$ This section describes how we designed and built each of our five models.

Fortunately, the first two models of (Knight and Graehl, 1997) deal with English only, so we can reuse them directly for Arabic/English transliteration. $$$$$ However, the situation is more complicated for language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems, such as Japanese/English and Arabic/English.

We applied the EM learning algorithm described in (Knight and Graehl, 1997) on this data, with one variation. $$$$$ We then applied the estimationmaximization (EM) algorithm (Baum, 1972) to generate symbol-mapping probabilities, shown in Figure 1.
We applied the EM learning algorithm described in (Knight and Graehl, 1997) on this data, with one variation. $$$$$ Because no alignments are possible, such pairs are skipped by the learning algorithm; cases like these must be solved by dictionary lookup anyway.

Transliterations can be generated for tokens in a source phrase (Knightand Graehl, 1997), with o (f, e) calculating phonetic similarity rather than orthographic. $$$$$ Here are a few more examples: Notice how the transliteration is more phonetic than orthographic; the letter h in Johnson does not produce any katakana.

Transliteration of a name, for the purpose of this work, is defined as its transcription in a different language, preserving the phonetics, perhaps in a different orthography [Knight and Graehl, 1997]. $$$$$ It is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories.

In this work we treat the process of transliteration as a process of direct transduction from sequences of tokens in the source language to sequences of tokens in the target language with no modeling of the phonetics of either source or target language (Knight and Graehl, 1997). $$$$$ I A /\ r 0 0 r o o Next, we map English sound sequences onto Japanese sound sequences.

Knight and Graehl (1997) build a generative model for back ward transliteration from Japanese to English. $$$$$ This method uses a generative model, incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process.
Knight and Graehl (1997) build a generative model for back ward transliteration from Japanese to English. $$$$$ After initial experiments along these lines, we decided to step back and build a generative model of the transliteration process, which goes like this: This divides our problem into five sub-problems.

(Knight and Graehl, 1997) proposed a generative transliteration model to transliterate foreign names in Japanese back to English using finite state transducers. $$$$$ For each glossary entry, we converted English words into English sounds using the previous section's model, and we converted katakana words into Japanese sounds using the next section's model.

Previous works usually take a generative approach, (Knight and Graehl, 1997). $$$$$ However, very little computational work has been done in this area; (Yamron et al., 1994) briefly mentions a patternmatching approach, while (Arbabi et al., 1994) discuss a hybrid neural-net/expert-system approach to (forward) transliteration.

However, back transliteration is known to be a very difficult task (Knight and Graehl, 1997). $$$$$ When word separators ( • ) are removed from the katakana phrases, rendering the task exceedingly difficult for people, the machine's performance is unchanged.
However, back transliteration is known to be a very difficult task (Knight and Graehl, 1997). $$$$$ Simply identifying which Arabic words to transliterate is a difficult task in itself; and while Japanese tends to insert extra vowel sounds, Arabic is usually written without any (short) vowels.

There are several studies on transliteration (e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1997)), and they tell us that machine transliteration of language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems is extremely difficult, and that the technology is still to immature for use in practical processing. $$$$$ Machine Transliteration

Back-transliteration is a difficult problem as exemplified in (Knight and Graehl 1997, Chen, et.al. 1998). $$$$$ Transliteration is not trivial to automate, but we will be concerned with an even more challenging problem—going from katakana back to English, i.e., back-transliteration.

One usually distinguishes between two types of transliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1997): Forward transliteration, where an originally Hebrewterm is to be transliterated to English; and Backward transliteration, in which a foreign term that has already been transliterated into Hebrew is to be recovered. $$$$$ Machine Transliteration
