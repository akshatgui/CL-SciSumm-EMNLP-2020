Fortunately, the first two models of (Knight and Graehl, 1997) deal with English only, so we can reuse them directly for Arabic/English transliteration. $$$$$ However, the situation is more complicated for language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems, such as Japanese/English and Arabic/English.

We applied the EM learning algorithm described in (Knight and Graehl, 1997) on this data, with one variation. $$$$$ We then applied the estimationmaximization (EM) algorithm (Baum, 1972) to generate symbol-mapping probabilities, shown in Figure 1.

Transliterations can be generated for tokens in a source phrase (Knightand Graehl, 1997), with o (f, e) calculating phonetic similarity rather than orthographic. $$$$$ Here are a few more examples

Transliteration of a name, for the purpose of this work, is defined as its transcription in a different language, preserving the phonetics, perhaps in a different orthography [Knight and Graehl, 1997]. $$$$$ It is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories.

In this work we treat the process of transliteration as a process of direct transduction from sequences of tokens in the source language to sequences of tokens in the target language with no modeling of the phonetics of either source or target language (Knight and Graehl, 1997). $$$$$ I A /\ r 0 0 r o o Next, we map English sound sequences onto Japanese sound sequences.

Previous works usually take a generative approach, (Knight and Graehl, 1997). $$$$$ However, very little computational work has been done in this area; (Yamron et al., 1994) briefly mentions a patternmatching approach, while (Arbabi et al., 1994) discuss a hybrid neural-net/expert-system approach to (forward) transliteration.

However, back transliteration is known to be a very difficult task (Knight and Graehl, 1997). $$$$$ When word separators ( • ) are removed from the katakana phrases, rendering the task exceedingly difficult for people, the machine's performance is unchanged.

There are several studies on transliteration (e.g., (Knight and Graehl, 1997)), and they tell us that machine transliteration of language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems is extremely difficult, and that the technology is still to immature for use in practical processing. $$$$$ Machine Transliteration
