We also note that Turney (2002) found movie reviews to be the most difficult of several domains for sentiment classification, reporting an accuracy of 65.83% on a 120-document set (random-choice performance: 50%). $$$$$ The difficulty with movie reviews is that there are two aspects to a movie, the events and actors in the movie (the elements of the movie), and the style and art of the movie (the movie as a gestalt; a unified whole).

Most of the authors traditionally use a classification-based approach for sentiment extraction and sentiment polarity detection (for example, Pang et al (2002), Turney (2002), Kim and Hovy (2004) and others), however, the research described in this paper uses the information retrieval (IR) paradigm which has also been used by some researchers. $$$$$ This is the motivation for the research described here.

Following (Turney, 2002), Yuen et al (2004) investigate the association between polarity words and some strongly-polarized morphemes in Chinese, and present a method for inferring sentiment orientations of Chinese words. $$$$$ Previous work has shown that NEAR performs better than AND when measuring the strength of semantic association between words (Turney, 2001).
Following (Turney, 2002), Yuen et al (2004) investigate the association between polarity words and some strongly-polarized morphemes in Chinese, and present a method for inferring sentiment orientations of Chinese words. $$$$$ As an example, they present the following three sentences (Hatzivassiloglou & McKeown, 1997): The third sentence is incorrect, because we use “and” with adjectives that have the same semantic orientation (“simple” and “well-received” are both positive), but we use “but” with adjectives that have different semantic orientations (“simplistic” is negative).

At phase level, Turney (2002) presents a technique for inferring the orientation and intensity of a phrase according to its PMI-IR statistical association with a set of strongly-polarized seed words. $$$$$ The PMI-IR algorithm is employed to estimate the semantic orientation of a phrase (Turney, 2001).
At phase level, Turney (2002) presents a technique for inferring the orientation and intensity of a phrase according to its PMI-IR statistical association with a set of strongly-polarized seed words. $$$$$ SO is positive when phrase is more strongly associated with “excellent” and negative when phrase is more strongly associated with “poor”.

Based on (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) and (Turney, 2002), we consider four types of structures (as shown in Table 5) during sentiment phrase extraction. $$$$$ Past work has demonstrated that adjectives are good indicators of subjective, evaluative sentences (Hatzivassiloglou & Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2001).

Different from (Turney, 2002), we consider phrases with negations as their initial words. $$$$$ Each of these 410 reviews was written by a different author.
Different from (Turney, 2002), we consider phrases with negations as their initial words. $$$$$ The AltaVista NEAR operator constrains the search to documents that contain the words within ten words of one another, in either order.

Turney (2002) described a way to automatically build such a lexicon based on looking at co-occurrences of words with other words whose sentiment is known. $$$$$ The AltaVista NEAR operator constrains the search to documents that contain the words within ten words of one another, in either order.
Turney (2002) described a way to automatically build such a lexicon based on looking at co-occurrences of words with other words whose sentiment is known. $$$$$ The other features could be based on the presence or absence of specific words, as is common in most text classification work.

The problem of sentiment extraction at the document level (sentiment classification) has been tackled as a text categorization task in which the goal is to assign to a document either positive ("thumbs up") or negative ("thumbs down") polarity (e.g. Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al. (2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al. (2003), Pang and Lee (2004)). $$$$$ Thumbs Up Or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation Applied To Unsupervised Classification Of Reviews
The problem of sentiment extraction at the document level (sentiment classification) has been tackled as a text categorization task in which the goal is to assign to a document either positive ("thumbs up") or negative ("thumbs down") polarity (e.g. Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al. (2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al. (2003), Pang and Lee (2004)). $$$$$ As far as I know, the only prior published work on the task of classifying reviews as thumbs up or down is Tong’s (2001) system for generating sentiment timelines.

Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method. $$$$$ The classification of a review is predicted by the orientation the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs.
Turney (2002) predicates the sentiment orientation of a review by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs, which is denoted as the semantic oriented method. $$$$$ The algorithm has three steps: (1) extract phrases containing adjectives or adverbs, (2) estimate the semantic orientation of each phrase, and (3) classify the review based on the average semantic orientation of the phrases.

In addition to the IE tasks in the biomedical domain, negation scope learning has attracted increasing attention in some natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The lexicon is specific to the domain (e.g., movies) and must be built anew for each new domain.

Thus, the method we investigate can be seen as a combination of methods for propagating sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for building sentiment lexicons based on distributional characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ This system tracks online discussions about movies and displays a plot of the number of positive sentiment and negative sentiment messages over time.

Others, such as Turney (2002), Pang and Vaithyanathan (2002), have examined the positive or negative polarity, rather than presence or absence, of affective content in text. $$$$$ The other features could be based on the presence or absence of specific words, as is common in most text classification work.
Others, such as Turney (2002), Pang and Vaithyanathan (2002), have examined the positive or negative polarity, rather than presence or absence, of affective content in text. $$$$$ A positive review could be summarized by picking out the sentence with the highest positive semantic orientation and a negative review could be summarized by extracting the sentence with the lowest negative semantic orientation.

Much of the work in sentiment analysis in the computational linguistics domain has focused either on short segments, such as sentences (Wilson et al, 2005), or on longer documents with an explicit polarity orientation like movie or product reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Past work has demonstrated that adjectives are good indicators of subjective, evaluative sentences (Hatzivassiloglou & Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2001).

These methods range from manual approaches of developing domain-dependent lexicons (Das and Chan, 2001) to semi-automated approaches (Hu and Liu, 2004) and fully automated approaches (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The lexicon is specific to the domain (e.g., movies) and must be built anew for each new domain.
These methods range from manual approaches of developing domain-dependent lexicons (Das and Chan, 2001) to semi-automated approaches (Hu and Liu, 2004) and fully automated approaches (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ There are a variety of potential applications for automated review rating.

Therefore, the overall sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of the content parts (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ It appears that movie reviews are difficult to classify, because the whole is not necessarily the sum of the parts; thus the accuracy on movie reviews is about 66%.
Therefore, the overall sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of the content parts (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ On the other hand, for banks and automobiles, it seems that the whole is the sum of the parts, and the accuracy is 80% to 84%.

Also, PMI-IR is useful for calculating semantic orientation and rating reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ The PMI-IR algorithm is employed to estimate the semantic orientation of a phrase (Turney, 2001).
Also, PMI-IR is useful for calculating semantic orientation and rating reviews (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ Preliminary experiments indicate that semantic orientation is also useful for summarization of reviews.

In previous work, statistical NLP computation over large corpora has been a slow, off line process, as in KNOWITALL (Etzioni et al, 2005) and also in PMI-IR applications such as sentiment classification (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ PMI-IR estimates PMI by issuing queries to a search engine (hence the IR in PMI-IR) and noting the number of hits (matching documents).

(Turney, 2002) worked on product reviews. $$$$$ The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews.
(Turney, 2002) worked on product reviews. $$$$$ If the words are statistically independent, then the probability that they co-occur is given by the product p(word1) p(word2).

Like our class-attribute associations, the common-sense knowledge that the word cool is positive while unethical is negative can be learned from associations in web-scale data (Turney, 2002). $$$$$ A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., “subtle nuances”) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., “very cavalier”).

Search counts or search results have also been used for sentiment analysis (Turney, 2002), for transliteration (Grefenstette et al, 2004), candidate selection in machine translation (Lapata and Keller, 2005), text similarity measurements (Sahami and Heilman, 2006), in correct parse tree filtering (Yates et al, 2006), and paraphrase evaluation (Fujita and Sato, 2008). $$$$$ Other related work is concerned with determining subjectivity (Hatzivassiloglou & Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2001).
