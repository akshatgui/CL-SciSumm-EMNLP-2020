The system of Kim and Hovy (2004) tackles orientation detection by attributing, to each term, a positivity score and a negativity score; interestingly, terms may thus be deemed to have both a positive and a negative correlation, maybe with different degrees, and some terms may be deemed to carry a stronger positive (or negative) orientation than others. $$$$$ We assume synonyms of positive words are mostly positive and antonyms mostly negative, e.g., the positive word ?good?

Kim and Hovy (2004) select candidate sentiment sentences and use word-based sentiment classifiers to classify unseen words into a negative or positive class. $$$$$ Given a new word, we use WordNet again to obtain a synonym set of the unseen word to determine how it interacts with our sentiment seed lists.

However, Kim and Hovy (2004) and Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) also address the classification into subjective/objective words and show this to be a potentially harder task than polarity classification with lower human agreement and automatic performance.
