To achieve roughly state-of-theart performance, RECONCILEACL09 employs a fairly comprehensive set of 61 features introduced in previous coreference resolution systems (see Bengtson and Roth (2008)). $$$$$ Understanding the Value of Features for Coreference Resolution
To achieve roughly state-of-theart performance, RECONCILEACL09 employs a fairly comprehensive set of 61 features introduced in previous coreference resolution systems (see Bengtson and Roth (2008)). $$$$$ This paper describes a rather simple pairwise classification model for coreference resolution, developed with a well-designed set of features.

Bengtson and Roth (2008) simply discard twinless CEs, but this solution is likely too lenient - it doles no punishment for mistakes on twinless annotated or extracted CEs and it would be tricked, for example, by a system that extracts only the CEs about which it is most confident. $$$$$ We do not use any other gold annotated input at evaluation time.

Inaddition, the architecture and system components of Reconcile (including a comprehensive set of features that draw on the expertise of state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches, such as Bengtson and Roth (2008)) result in performance closer to the state-of-the-art. $$$$$ Our results show that a pairwise model with strong features outperforms a state-of-the-art system with a more complex model.

Building on elements of the coreference system described in Bengtson and Roth (2008), we design an end-to-end system (Sec. 2) that identifies candidate mentions and then applies one of two inference protocols, Best-Link and All-Link (Sec. 2.3), to disambiguate and cluster them. $$$$$ Best-Link was shown to outperform Closest-Link in an experiment by Ng and Cardie (2002b).

Illinois-Coref follows the architecture used in Bengtson and Roth (2008). $$$$$ We suggest that our system can be used as a baseline for the development of more complex models – which may have less impact when a more robust set of features is used.

For example, a memorization feature is a word pair composed of the head nouns of the two NPs involved in an instance (Bengtson and Roth, 2008). $$$$$ To enable the system to learn such patterns, we treat the presence or absence of each pair of final head nouns, one from each mention of an example, as a feature.
