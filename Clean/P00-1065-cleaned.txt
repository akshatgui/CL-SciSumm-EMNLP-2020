See (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000) for some promising initial work in applying statistical techniques to the FrameNet database to automatically label frame elements. $$$$$ The FrameNet database defines a tagset of semantic roles called frame elements, and includes roughly 50,000 sentences from the British National Corpus which have been hand-labeled with these frame elements.

While a machine learning approach is used in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000) to determine general semantic roles, we used a simple rule-based traversal of the parse tree instead, which could also reliably determine the generic agent and patient role of a sentence, and this suffices for our current purpose. $$$$$ Identifying these roles, for example, could allow a system to determine that in the sentence &quot;The first one crashed&quot; the subject is the vehicle, but in the sentence &quot;The first one crashed it&quot; the subject is the agent, which would help in information extraction in this domain.

Many researchers (Blaheta and Charniak 2000), (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000), showed that lexical and syntactic information is very useful for predicate argument recognition tasks, such as semantic roles. $$$$$ Adding semantic role subcategorization information to this syntactic information could extend this idea to use richer semantic knowledge.

Gildea and Jurafsky (2000, 2002) describe a statistical approach for semantic role labelling using data collected from FrameNet. $$$$$ Our approach to semantic analysis is to treat the problem of semantic role labeling like the similar problems of parsing, part of speech tagging, and word sense disambiguation.
Gildea and Jurafsky (2000, 2002) describe a statistical approach for semantic role labelling using data collected from FrameNet. $$$$$ Probabilities for each possible semantic role r are then computed from the features.

(Pado et al., 2008) describe an unsupervised approach that, like ours, uses verbal argument patterns to deduce deverbal patterns, though the resulting labels are semantic roles used in SLR tasks (cf. (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000)) rather than syntactic roles. $$$$$ The next section describes the set of frame elements/semantic roles used by our system.

Starting with Gildea and Jurafsky (2000), a number of studies have developed (almost exclusively statistical) models of this task, e.g. Thompson et al. (2003) and Fleischman et al. (2003). $$$$$ Our statistical algorithms are trained on a hand-labeled dataset

Since direct assignment of role labels to instances fails due to the preponderance of unlabelled instances, which make up 86.7% of all instances, we follow Gildea and Jurafsky (2000) in splitting the task into two sequential subtasks $$$$$ Probabilities for each possible semantic role r are then computed from the features.
Since direct assignment of role labels to instances fails due to the preponderance of unlabelled instances, which make up 86.7% of all instances, we follow Gildea and Jurafsky (2000) in splitting the task into two sequential subtasks $$$$$ The clustered head word alone correctly classified 79.7% of the cases where the head word was in the vocabulary used for clustering; 97.9% of instances of nominal head words were in the vocabulary.

There has been some related work on using the frame of FrameNet for reasoning (Chang et al, 2002) and also on the automatic annotation of English texts with regard to the relevant frames (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000) and frame elements. $$$$$ Our statistical algorithms are trained on a hand-labeled dataset

To our knowledge, Gildea and Jurafsky (2000) is the only work that uses FrameNet to build a statistical semantic classifier. $$$$$ Adding semantic role subcategorization information to this syntactic information could extend this idea to use richer semantic knowledge.

We extend Gildea and Jurafsky (2000)'s initial effort in three ways. $$$$$ Although we expect our features to interact in various ways, the data are too sparse to calculate probabilities directly on the full set of features.

Training (32,251 sentences), development (3,491 sentences), and held out test sets (3,398 sentences) were generated from the June 2002 FrameNet release following the divisions used in Gildea and Jurafsky (2000). $$$$$ Example sentences are shown in Table 1.

Due to data sparsity issues, we do not calculate this model directly, but rather, model various feature combinations as described in Gildea and Jurafsky (2000). $$$$$ Since the parser used assigns each constituent a head word as an integral part of the parsing model, we were able to read the head words of the constituents from the parser output.
