In (Bod, 1992b) super strong equivalence relations between other stochastic grammars are studied. $$$$$ A New Approach: Data Oriented Parsing The starting-point of our approach is the idea indicated above, that when a human language user analyzes sentences, there is a strong preference for the recognition of sentences, constituents and patterns that occurred before in the experience of the language user.
In (Bod, 1992b) super strong equivalence relations between other stochastic grammars are studied. $$$$$ No one has ever succeeded in doing so except in relatively small grammars.

It is easy to show that an input string can be parsed with conventional parsing techniques, by applying subtrees instead of rules to the input string (Bod, 1992a). $$$$$ Parsing then does not happen by applying grammatical rules to rite input sentence, but by constructing an optinml analogy between the input sentence and as many corpus sentences ,as possible.
It is easy to show that an input string can be parsed with conventional parsing techniques, by applying subtrees instead of rules to the input string (Bod, 1992a). $$$$$ Often we are not interested in all parses of an alnbiguous input string, neither in their exact probabilities, but only in which parse is the preferred parse.

In their place we added a new feature, the probability of a rule's source side tree given its root label, which is essentially the same model used in Data-Oriented Parsing (Bod, 1992). $$$$$ A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF LANGUAGE DATA ORIENTED PARSING RENS BOlt* Department of Computational I Jnguistics University of Amsterdmn Spuistraat 134 1012 VII Amsterdam The Netherlands rens@alf.let.uva.nl PERFORMANCE: Abstract 1)ata Oriented Parsing (IX)P) is a model where no abstract rules, but language xt~riences in the ti3ru~ of all ,malyzed COlpUS, constitute the basis for langnage processing.

Due to this extension, the one to one mapping between a derivation and a parse tree, which holds in CFGs, does not hold any more; many derivations might generate the same parse-tree ,rl &apos; his seemingly spurious ambiguity turns out crucial for statistical disambiguation as defined in (Bod, 1992) and in (Schabes and Waters, 1993), where the derivations are considered different stochastic processes and their probabilities all contribute to the probability of the generated parse. $$$$$ In DOP, the probability of a parse depends on all tuples of coustructious that generate that parse.

It occurs because many systems, such as the ones proposed by (Bod, 1992), (Galley, et .al., 2004), and (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) represent their result space in terms of weighted partial results of various sizes that may be assembled in multiple ways. $$$$$ Disambiguation occurs as a side-effect.

The Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) method suggested in Scha (1990) and developed in Bod (19921995) is a probabilistic parsing strategy which does not single out a narrowly predefined set of structures as the statistically significant ones. $$$$$ DOP can be implemented by using colivelllional parsing strategies.
