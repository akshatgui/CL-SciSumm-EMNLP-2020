KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a semantic parser learning system which uses word subsequence kernel based SVM (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) classifiers and was shown to be robust to noise compared to other semantic parser learners. $$$$$ Kernel methods (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) are particularly suitable for semantic parsing because it involves mappingphrases of natural language (NL) sentences to semantic concepts in a meaning representation lan guage (MRL).

Word subsequence kernel was employed in (Kate and Mooney, 2006) to compute the similarity between two substrings. $$$$$ The more the two strings share, the greater the similarity score will be.

We note that this use of multiple classifiers to determine the most probable parse is similar to the method used in the KRISP semantic parser (Kate and Mooney, 2006). $$$$$ 2.2 Most Probable Semantic Derivation.
We note that this use of multiple classifiers to determine the most probable parse is similar to the method used in the KRISP semantic parser (Kate and Mooney, 2006). $$$$$ The results are also similar on the GEOQUERY corpus.

We describe how these are applied in an error driven manner using the base semantic parsing learning algorithm presented in (Kate and Mooney, 2006) resulting in a better learned semantic parser. $$$$$ Using String-Kernels For Learning Semantic Parsers

We very briefly describe the semantic parser learning system, KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006), which we will use as a base system for transforming MRGs, we however note that the MRG transformation methods presented in this paper are general enough to work with any system which learns semantic parser using MRGs. $$$$$ Previous work on learning semantic parsers either employ rule-based algorithms (Tang andMooney, 2001; Kate et al, 2005), or use sta tistical feature-based methods (Ge and Mooney, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006).

KRISP (Kernel-based Robust Interpretation for Semantic Parsing) (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a supervised learning system for semantic parsing which takes NL sentences paired with their MRs as training data. $$$$$ In contrast, kernel methods allow a convenient mechanism to implicitly work with a potentially infinite number of features which can robustly capture these range of contexts even when the data is noisy.Our system, KRISP (Kernel-based Robust Interpretation for Semantic Parsing), takes NL sentences paired with their formal meaning representations as training data.

Figure 1 shows an example of an NL sentence and its MR from the CLANG domain.

Experimentally, KRISP compares favorably to other existing semantic parsing systems and is particularly robust to noisy training data (Kate and Mooney, 2006). $$$$$ Our experiments on two real world data sets show that this approachcompares favorably to other existing sys tems and is particularly robust to noise.
