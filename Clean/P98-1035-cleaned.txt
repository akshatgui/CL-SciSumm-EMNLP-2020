But (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) chooses the lexical heads of the two previous constituents as determined by a shift-reduce parser, and works better than a trigram model. $$$$$ Our solution is inspired by an HMM re-estimation technique that works on pruned — N-best — trellises(Byrne et al., 1998).
But (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) chooses the lexical heads of the two previous constituents as determined by a shift-reduce parser, and works better than a trigram model. $$$$$ The probability associated with each model action is determined as described in section 3.1, based on counts C(m)(y(m), x(m)), one set for each model component.

This marraige of models has been tested in other fields such as speech recognition (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) with success. $$$$$ The model assigns probability to every joint sequence of words-binary-parse-structure with headword annotation and operates in a left-to-right manner — therefore usable for automatic speech recognition.

(Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) combine unlabeled and labeled data for parsing with a view towards language modeling applications. $$$$$ This is the main difference between our approach and other approaches to statistical natural language parsing.

Aware that the n-gram obscures many linguistically-signi cant distinctions (Chomsky, 1956, section 2.3), many speech researchers (Jelinek and Laerty, 1991) sought to incorporate hierarchical phrase structure into language modeling (see (Stolcke, 1997)) although it was not until the late 1990s that such models were able to signi cantly improve on 3-grams (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998). $$$$$ Exploiting Syntactic Structure for Language Modeling

The language model described by Chelba and Jelinek (1998) similarly conditions on linguistically relevant words by assigning partial phrase structure to the history and percolating headwords. $$$$$ The linguistically correct partial parse of the word history when predicting after is shown in Figure 1.

In this situation, a structured language model (SLM) was proposed by Chelba and Jelinek (1998). $$$$$ The model we present is closely related to the one investigated in (Chelba et al., 1997), however different in a few important aspects

 $$$$$ The workings of the parser module are similar to those of Spatter (Jelinek et al., 1994).

Chelba and Jelinek (1998) proposed that syntactic structure could be used as an alternative technique in language modeling. $$$$$ Exploiting Syntactic Structure for Language Modeling
Chelba and Jelinek (1998) proposed that syntactic structure could be used as an alternative technique in language modeling. $$$$$ The main goal of the present work is to develop a language model that uses syntactic structure to model long-distance dependencies.

As an alternative option to our verb-modifier experiments, structured language models (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) might be considered to improve clause coherence, until full-featured syntax-based MT models (Yamada and Knight (2002), Eisner (2003), Chiang (2005) among many others) aretested when translating to morphologically rich languages. $$$$$ The results we obtained are presented in the experiments section.

In the first type, probability of a word is decided based on a parse-tree information like grammatical headwords in a sentence (Charniak, 2001) (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998), or based on part of-speech (POS) tag information (Galescu and Ringger, 1999). $$$$$ Let an elementary event in the derivation(W,T) = (word-to-tag, ho.tag , h_i.tag).
