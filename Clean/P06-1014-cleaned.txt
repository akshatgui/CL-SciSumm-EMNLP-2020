However, in the coarse-grained task, the sense inventory was first clustered semi-automatically with each cluster representing an equivalence class over senses (Navigli, 2006). $$$$$ In this section, we present an approach to the automatic construction of a coarse-grained sense inventory based on the mapping of WordNet senses to coarse senses in the Oxford Dictionary of English.
However, in the coarse-grained task, the sense inventory was first clustered semi-automatically with each cluster representing an equivalence class over senses (Navigli, 2006). $$$$$ We modified the sense inventory of the SSI lexical knowledge base by adopting the coarse inventory acquired automatically.

Navigli (2006) proposed an automatic approach for mapping WordNet senses to the coarse grained sense distinctions of the Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE). $$$$$ First, we provide a wide-coverage method for clustering WordNet senses via a mapping to a coarse-grained sense inventory, namely the Oxford Dictionary of English (Soanes and Stevenson, 2003) (Section 2).

The classifier also made use of resources such as topic signatures data (Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004), the WordNet domain dataset (Magnini and Cavaglia`, 2000), and the mappings of WordNet senses to ODE senses produced by Navigli (2006). $$$$$ Overall, 4,599 out of the 5,077 WordNet senses had a corresponding sense in ODE (i.e. the ODE covered 90.58% of the WordNet senses in the data set), while 2,053 out of the 2,600 ODE senses had an analogous entry in WordNet (i.e.
The classifier also made use of resources such as topic signatures data (Agirre and de Lacalle, 2004), the WordNet domain dataset (Magnini and Cavaglia`, 2000), and the mappings of WordNet senses to ODE senses produced by Navigli (2006). $$$$$ Agirre and Lopez (2003) analyze a set of methods to cluster WordNet senses based on the use of confusion matrices from the results of WSD systems, translation equivalences, and topic signatures (word co-occurrences extracted from the web).

In addition, we show in Table 7 the F-score results provided by Snow et al (2007) for their SVM-based system and for the mapping-based approach of Navigli (2006), denoted by ODE. $$$$$ In this section, we present an approach to the automatic construction of a coarse-grained sense inventory based on the mapping of WordNet senses to coarse senses in the Oxford Dictionary of English.

Navigli (2006) has induced clusters by mapping WordNet senses to a more coarse-grained lexical resource. $$$$$ We assess the quality of the mapping and the induced clustering, and evaluate the performance of coarse WSD systems in the Senseval-3 English all-words task.

(Navigli, 2006) presents an automatic approach for mapping between sense inventories; here similarities in gloss definition and structured relations between the two sense inventories are exploited in order to map between WordNet senses and distinctions made within the coarser-grained Oxford English Dictionary. $$$$$ Second, we evaluate the performance of WSD systems when using coarse-grained sense inventories (Section 4).

Finally, we use as a feature the mappings produced in (Navigli, 2006) of WordNet senses to Oxford English Dictionary senses. $$$$$ A key feature in our approach is the use of a well-established dictionary encoding sense hierarchies.

In order to evaluate the entire sense-clustered taxonomy, we have employed an evaluation method inspired by Word Sense Disambiguation (this is similar to an evaluation used in Navigli, 2006, however we do not remove monosemous clusters). $$$$$ Indeed, such an evaluation would be difficult and timeconsuming without a coarse sense inventory like that of ODE.

To tackle the granularity issue, we produced a coarser-grained version of the WordNet sense inventory based on the procedure described by Navigli (2006). $$$$$ In this paper, we present a method for reducing the granularity of the WordNet sense inventory based on the mapping to a manually crafted dictionary encoding sense hierarchies, namely the Oxford Dictionary of English.

 $$$$$ To match definitions in a semantic manner we adopted a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm, Structural Semantic Interconnections (SSI, Navigli and Velardi (2004)).
 $$$$$ Finally, the method presented here could be useful for lexicographers in the comparison of the quality of dictionaries, and in the detection of missing word senses.

This clustering was created automatically with the aid of a methodology described in (Navigli, 2006). $$$$$ The data set was created by two annotators and included only polysemous words.

Automatically creating new alignments is difficult because of word ambiguities, different granularities of senses, or language specific conceptualizations (Navigli, 2006). $$$$$ We call this new setting SSI* (as opposed to SSI used in Table 4).
