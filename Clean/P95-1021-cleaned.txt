Sister-adjunctionis not an operation found in standard de ni tions of TAG, but is borrowed from D-TreeGrammar (Rambow et al, 1995). $$$$$ The second composition operation involving dtrees is called sister-adjunction.

These spines can be combined using a sister-ad junction operation (Rambow et al, 1995), to form larger pieces of structure. $$$$$ D-trees can be composed using two operations: subsertion and sister-adjunction.

Chiang's model adds a third composition operation called sister-ad junction (see Figure 3), borrowed from D-tree substitution grammar (Rambow et al, 1995). $$$$$ The second composition operation involving dtrees is called sister-adjunction.

Variants of TAG like TIG (Schabes and Waters, 1995) or D-Tree grammars (Rambow et al, 1995) are motivated by linguistic or formal considerations rather than pedagogical or computational ones. $$$$$ D-Tree Grammars

Other formalisms aiming to model dependency correctly similarly expand weak generative capacity, notably D-tree Substitution Grammar (Rambow et al, 1995), and consequently end up with much greater parsing complexity. $$$$$ We define a new grammar formalism, called D-Tree arises from work on Tree- Adjoining Grammars (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975).

Consider the case of sentences which contain both bridge and raising verbs, noted by Rambow et al (1995). $$$$$ For example, consider the d-trees a and shown in Figure 3.
