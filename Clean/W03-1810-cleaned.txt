Similar to Lin (1999), McCarthy et al (2003) and Fazly and Stevenson (2006), our method makes use of automatically generated thesauri; the technique used to compile the thesauri differs from previous work. $$$$$ Both Lin (1999) and Schone and Jurafsky (2001) have used distributional similarity to detect compositionality in multiwords.

Based on the observation (Haspelmath, 2002) that compositional collocations tend to be hyponyms of their head constituent, they propose a model which considers the semantic similarity between a collocation and its constituent words.McCarthy et al (2003) also investigate several tests for compositionality including one (simplex score) based on the observation that compositional collocations tend to be similar inmeaning to their constituent parts. $$$$$ Bannard et al.

Table 5 shows the results of using different similarity measures with the simplex score test and data of McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ These two measures correlated well together (T., = -0.51, z = -5.37) and both are significantly correlated (using the Mann Whitney U test) with whether the candidate is found in either WordNet or ANLT, see table 3, although the relationship using the automatic thesaurus is slightly higher.
Table 5 shows the results of using different similarity measures with the simplex score test and data of McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ It also could be useful to use the measures to tell whether the meaning comes from the verb or the particle or both, as Bannard et al.

McCarthy et al (2003) evaluate the precision of Rasp at identifying VPCs to be 87.6% and the recall to be 49.4%. $$$$$ In this paper we are not concerned with evaluation of precision and recall of the extraction of phrasal verbs from a parser, although we have done some preliminary experiments in this direction on the Wall Street Journal (wsJ), see section 3.
McCarthy et al (2003) evaluate the precision of Rasp at identifying VPCs to be 87.6% and the recall to be 49.4%. $$$$$ Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002) demonstrated that combining syntactic evidence using automatic PoS taggers and statistical chunkers, and feeding evidence from a number of tokens into a memory based-learner gave high precision and recall, using marked up WSJ text to gauge precision, and phrasals listed in the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) (Grover et al., 1993) attested in the same corpus for recall.

Also, we ignore the ambiguity between particles and adverbs, which is the principal reason for our evaluation being much higher than that reported by McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ Also, those constructions judged to be phrasals tended to have higher ranks (higher opaqueness and relatedness) than prepositional verb particle constructions.

In order to get a clearer sense of the impact of selectional preferences on the results, we investigated the relative performance over VPCs of varying semantic compositionality, based on 117 VPCs (f? 1) attested in the data set of McCarthy et al (2003). $$$$$ As well as having idiosyncratic semantics, phrasals also display specific syntactic behaviour such as permitting particle movement when used in the transitive; for example

McCarthy et al (2003) provides compositionality judgements from three human judges, which we take the average of and bin into 11 categories (with 0= non-compositional and 10= fully compositional). $$$$$ In our experiments we asked human judges to rank phrasal verb candidates as to how compositional they are.

McCarthy et al (2003) suggested that compositional phrasal verbs should have similar neighbours as for their simplex verbs. $$$$$ The intuition is that the neighbours of the simplex verb should be similar to those of the phrasal where the phrasal has a compositional meaning, and that the phrasal neighbours should include phrasal candidates with the same particle.

In order to evaluate our algorithm in comparison with previous work, we also tested it on the manual ranking list created by McCarthy et al (2003) . $$$$$ There has been a lot of recent work on extraction of multiwords from corpora we focus specifically on work involving multiword verbs, and detecting compositionality of multiwords.
