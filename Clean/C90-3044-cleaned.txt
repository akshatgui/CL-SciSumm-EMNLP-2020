The construction of bilingual knowledge base, in the development of example-based machine translation systems (Sato and Nagao, 1990), is vitally critical. $$$$$ 1 In t roduct ion Use of extracted information fiom examples or example-based translation is becoming the new wave of machine translation.

For example, (Sato and Nagao, 1990} combine a measure of structural similarity with a measure of word distance in order to obtain the overall distance measure that is used for matching. $$$$$ size(TU) = the number of nodes in TU To calculate 2, we need a measure of simi- larity between two environments, i.e.
For example, (Sato and Nagao, 1990} combine a measure of structural similarity with a measure of word distance in order to obtain the overall distance measure that is used for matching. $$$$$ mpoint (TU,  WD)  = summation of similarity values between corre- sponding nodes in two restricted environments ~t the best matching We use this value as a measure of similarity between two environments.

This is the same idea as example-based machine translation (Sato and Nagao, 1990 and Furuse et .al., 1994). $$$$$ Toward Memory--based Translation Satoshi SATO and Ma.koto NAGAO Dept.
This is the same idea as example-based machine translation (Sato and Nagao, 1990 and Furuse et .al., 1994). $$$$$ The idea first appeared in [Nagao 84], and some research has followed it [Sumita 88][Sato 89][Sadler 89a.

In the wake of the pioneering work of Nagao (1984), Brown et al (1990) and Sato and Nagao (1990), Machine Translation (MT) research has increasingly focused on the issue of how to acquire translation knowledge from aligned parallel texts. $$$$$ Toward Memory--based Translation Satoshi SATO and Ma.koto NAGAO Dept.
