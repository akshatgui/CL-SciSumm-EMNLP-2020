Our initial experiments with the integration of GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997), the evolving German version of WordNet, seem to confirm the positive results described for WordNet (de Buenaga Rodriguez et al, 1997) and will thus be extended. $$$$$ The basic framework of GermaNet is similar to the Princeton WordNet (Miller et al., 1993), guaranteeing maximal compatibility.
Our initial experiments with the integration of GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997), the evolving German version of WordNet, seem to confirm the positive results described for WordNet (de Buenaga Rodriguez et al, 1997) and will thus be extended. $$$$$ A wordnet for German has been described which, compared with the Princeton WordNet, integrates principle-based modifications and extensions on the constructional and organizational level as well as on the level of lexical and conceptual relations.

To divide adjectives into groups, Tsvetkov et al (2014) use 13 top-level classes from the adapted taxonomy of Hundsnurscher and Splett (1982), which is incorporated in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ The basic framework of GermaNet is similar to the Princeton WordNet (Miller et al., 1993), guaranteeing maximal compatibility.

Synonyms in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) receive the score 1. $$$$$ GermaNet lists synonyms along with each concept.
Synonyms in GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) receive the score 1. $$$$$ This is only possible if all synonyms of both senses and all their dependent nodes in the hierarchy share the same regular polysemy, which is hardly ever the case.

GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) is a large lexical database, where words are associated with POS in formation and semantic sorts, which are organized in a fine-grained hierarchy. $$$$$ GermaNet - A Lexical-Semantic Net For German
GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) is a large lexical database, where words are associated with POS in formation and semantic sorts, which are organized in a fine-grained hierarchy. $$$$$ It can be thought of as an online ontology in which meanings associated with words (so-called synsets) are grouped according to their semantic relatedness.

For German, we address this issue by introducing two further types of features into our model based on the GermaNet resource (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ GermaNet - A Lexical-Semantic Net For German
For German, we address this issue by introducing two further types of features into our model based on the GermaNet resource (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ Innovative features of GermaNet are a new treatment of regular polysemy and of particle verbs, as well as a principle-based encoding of crossclassification and artificial concepts.

 $$$$$ As compatibility with the Princeton WordNet and EuroWordNet is a major construction criteria of GermaNet, German can now, finally, be integrated into multilingual large-scale projects based on ontological and conceptual information.
 $$$$$ This constitutes an important step towards the design of truly multilingual tools applicable in key areas such as information retrieval and intelligent Internet search engines.

This paper presents an algorithm for finding systematic polysemous classes in WordNet (Miller et al 1990) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg 1997) - a semantic database for German similar to WordNet. $$$$$ GermaNet - A Lexical-Semantic Net For German
This paper presents an algorithm for finding systematic polysemous classes in WordNet (Miller et al 1990) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg 1997) - a semantic database for German similar to WordNet. $$$$$ The basic framework of GermaNet is similar to the Princeton WordNet (Miller et al., 1993), guaranteeing maximal compatibility.

The system currently uses two different terminological onto logies WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) as chaining resources which have been mapped onto the database for mat. $$$$$ We use the Princeton WordNet technology for the database format, database compilation, as well as the Princeton WordNet interface, applying extensions only where necessary.
The system currently uses two different terminological onto logies WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) as chaining resources which have been mapped onto the database for mat. $$$$$ GermaNet, however, currently assumes only one basic meronymy relation.

We select the hyper parameters of our model using an independent development set, which we extract from the lexical resource GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ GermaNet - A Lexical-Semantic Net For German
We select the hyper parameters of our model using an independent development set, which we extract from the lexical resource GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997). $$$$$ The development of a German wordnet has the advantage that the applications developed for English using WordNet as a resource can be used for German with only minor modifications.
