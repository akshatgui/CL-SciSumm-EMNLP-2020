They train a statistical parser on trees with only semantic labels on the nodes; however, they do not integrate syntactic and semantic parsing. History-based models of parsing were first introduced in (Black et al, 1993). $$$$$ Towards History-Based Grammars

In recent years, re-ranking techniques have been successfully used in statistical parsers to rerank the output of history-based models (Black et al, 1993). $$$$$ Towards History-Based Grammars

The major alternative to PCFG-based approaches are so-called history-based parsers (Black et al, 1993). $$$$$ Towards History-Based Grammars

Instead, the dependency tree is built stepwise and the decision about what step to take next (e.g. which dependency to insert) can be based on information about, in theory all, previous steps and their results (in the context of generative probabilistic parsing, Black et al (1993) call this the history). $$$$$ Towards History-Based Grammars
