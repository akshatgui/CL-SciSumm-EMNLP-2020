In the Conceptual Case Frame Acquisition project (RiloffandSchmelzenbach, 1998), extraction patterns, a domain semantic lexicon, and a list of conceptual roles and associated semantic categories for the domain are used to produce multiple-slot case frames with selectional restrictions. $$$$$ Extraction patterns with compatible syntactic constraints are then ISemantic constraints could be associated with the conceptual roles assigned by the human reviewer, but our goal is to assign both the conceptual roles and selectional restrictions automatically. merged to produce multi-slot case frames with selectional restrictions.

In related unsupervised tasks, Riloff and colleagues have learned case frames for verbs (e.g., Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), while Gildea (2002) has learned role slot mappings (but does not apply the knowledge for the labelling task). $$$$$ The case frames learned by our system are not necessarily more powerful then those generated by other systems.

There are number of different existing approaches for identifying semantic roles, varying from traditional parsing approaches, for example using HPSG grammars and Lexical Functional Grammars, that strongly rely on manually developed grammars and lexicons, to data-driven approaches, for example AutoSlog (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998). $$$$$ Note that the number of possible extractions can vary depending on the output of the system. reimplemented AutoSlog-TS to use a different sentence analyzer, so these results are slightly different from those reported in (Riloff, 19966).

Applying such a model to information extraction, in AutoSlog Riloff (1993) builds a list of patterns for filling in semantic slots in a specific domain, as well as a method for automatic acquisition of case frames (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998). $$$$$ Our approach builds upon earlier work on corpus-based methods for generating extraction patterns (Riloff, 1996b) and semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997).
