We have implemented the inside algorithm, the outside algorithm, and the inside-outside speedup described by Li and Eisner (2009), plut the first-order expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002) and its second-order version (Li and Eisner, 2009). $$$$$ It is common to define further useful operations (as macros), which modify existing relations not by editing their source code but simply by operating on them “from outside.” ∗A brief version of this work, with some additional material, first appeared as (Eisner, 2001a).

We use standard algorithms (Eisner, 2002) to compute the path sums as well as their gradients with respect to theta for optimization (section 4.1). $$$$$ Alternatively, discard EM and use gradient-based optimization.

We used the OpenFST library (Allauzen et al, 2007) to implement all finite-state computations, using the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002) for training. $$$$$ Such approaches have been tried recently in restricted cases (McCallum et al., 2000; Eisner, 2001b; Lafferty et al., 2001).

Under this paradigm, we use weights from the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002), to compute first-order statistics (e.g., the expected hypothesis length or feature counts) over packed forests of translations (lattices or hyper graphs). $$$$$ For other parameterizations, the path must instead yield a vector of arc traversal counts or feature counts.

Eisner (2002) uses closed semirings that are also equipped with a Kleene closure operator. $$$$$ Its unusual flexibility for the practiced programmer stems from the many operations under which rational relations are closed.

However, Eisner (2002, section 5) observes that this is inefficient when n is large. $$$$$ In short, current finite-state toolkits include no training algorithms, because none exist for the large space of statistical models that the toolkits can in principle describe and run.

This follows Eisner (2002), who similarly generalized the forward-backward algorithm. $$$$$ For example, the forward-backward algorithm (Baum, 1972) trains only Hidden Markov Models, while (Ristad and Yianilos, 1996) trains only stochastic edit distance.
This follows Eisner (2002), who similarly generalized the forward-backward algorithm. $$$$$ Here, the forward and backward probabilities can be computed in time only O(m + n log n) (Fredman and Tar an, 1987). k-best variants are also possible.

For example, Eisner (2002) uses finite-state operations such as composition, which do combine weights entirely within the expectation semiring before their result is passed to the forward-backward algorithm. $$$$$ Multiplication and addition are replaced by binary operations ® and ® on K. Thus ® is used to combine arc weights into a path weight and ® is used to combine the weights of alternative paths.

This logic can be used with the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002) to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a word-to-word translation model. $$$$$ Maximum-likelihood estimation guesses 0ˆ to be the 0 maximizing Hi fθ(xi, yi).

Eisner (2002) has claimed that parsing under an expectation semiring is equivalent to the Inside-Outside algorithm for PCFGs. $$$$$ A more subtle example is weighted FSAs that approximate PCFGs (Nederhof, 2000; Mohri and Nederhof, 2001), or to extend the idea, weighted FSTs that approximate joint or conditional synchronous PCFGs built for translation.
