A Chinese resume C=c1',c2',...,ck' is first tokenized into C= w1,w2,...,wk with a Chinese word segmentation system LSP (Gao et al., 2003). $$$$$ This paper presents a Chinese word segmentation system that uses improved sourcechannel models of Chinese sentence generation.

Then, we use a back-off schema (Katz, 1987) to deal with the data sparseness problem when estimating the probability P (L) (Gao et al, 2003). $$$$$ Ideally, given an annotated corpus, where each sentence is segmented into words which are tagged by their classes, the trigram word class probabilities can be calculated using MLE, together with a backoff schema (Katz, 1987) to deal with the sparse data problem.
Then, we use a back-off schema (Katz, 1987) to deal with the data sparseness problem when estimating the probability P (L) (Gao et al, 2003). $$$$$ To solve the first problem, we use two methods to resolve segmentation ambiguities in the initial segmented training data.

We selected SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) as the SVM classifier toolkit and LSP (Gao et al, 2003) for Chinese word segmentation and named entity identification. $$$$$ We then present a Chinese word segmentation system which provides a solution to the four fundamental problems of word-level Chinese language processing

That is if we collect all words seen in the training data and store them into a lexicon, then each word in a test set is either a lexicon word or an OOV (out of vocabulary) word (Gao et al., 2003). $$$$$ ❑ Morphologically derived words

In our experiments we identify SL (Chinese) NEs implicitly found by the word segmentation algorithm stated in Gao et al (2003), and the dictionaries for translating NEs include the same one used for QSL-TFIDF, and the LDC Chinese/English NE dictionary. $$$$$ Improved Source-Channel Models For Chinese Word Segmentation
