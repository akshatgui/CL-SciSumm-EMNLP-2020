Finally, Suzuki et al (2009) present a very effective semi-supervised approach in which features from multiple generative models estimated on unlabeled data are combined in a discriminative system for structured prediction. $$$$$ In this framework, a structured conditional model is constructed by incorporating a series of generative models, whose parameters are estimated from unlabeled data.

 $$$$$ 5 can be defined as follows.
 $$$$$ The main choice in the approach is the partitioning of f(x, y) into components r1(x, y) ... rk(x, y), which in our experience is straightforward.

Both Suzuki et al (2009) and Chen et al (2013) adopt the higher order parsing model of Carreras (2007), and Suzuki et al (2009) also incorporate word cluster features proposed by Koo et al (2008) in their system. $$$$$ These settings match the evaluation setting in previous work such as (McDonald et al., 2005a; Koo et al., 2008).

(2008), and that allow the use of second-order parsing models.

Also, some work has incorporated unsupervised word clusters as features, including that of Koo et al (2008) and Suzuki et al (2009), who utilized unsupervised word clusters created using the Brown et al (1992) hierarchical clustering algorithm. $$$$$ First, hierarchical word clusters are derived from unlabeled data using the Brown et al. clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992).

Although large amounts of unlabeled data are known to improve semi-supervised parsing (Suzuki et al, 2009), the best unsupervised systems use less data than is available for supervised training, relying on complex models instead $$$$$ It is often straightforward to obtain large amounts of unlabeled data, making semi-supervised approaches appealing; previous work on semisupervised methods for dependency parsing includes (Smith and Eisner, 2007; Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008).
Although large amounts of unlabeled data are known to improve semi-supervised parsing (Suzuki et al, 2009), the best unsupervised systems use less data than is available for supervised training, relying on complex models instead $$$$$ These data sets are identical to the unlabeled data used in (Koo et al., 2008), and are disjoint from the training, development and test sets.

We prepared a total of 3.72 billion token text data as unsupervised data following the instructions given in (Suzuki et al, 2009). $$$$$ In addition, Table 4 shows the performance of our proposed method using 3.72 billion tokens of unlabeled data.

Semi-supervised models such as Ando and Zhang (2005), Suzuki and Isozaki (2008), and Suzuki et al (2009) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. $$$$$ Note that there are some similarities between our two-stage semi-supervised learning approach and the semi-supervised learning method introduced by (Blitzer et al., 2006), which is an extension of the method described by (Ando and Zhang, 2005).

Our system also compares favourably with the system of Carreras et al (2008) that relies on a more complex generative model, namely Tree Adjoining Grammars, and the system of Suzuki et al (2009) that makes use of external data (unannotated text). $$$$$ To facilitate comparisons with previous work, we used exactly the same training, development and test sets as those described in (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Koo et al., 2008).
