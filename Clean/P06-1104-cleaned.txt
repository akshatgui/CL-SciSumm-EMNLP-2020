To benefit from both views, a composite kernel (Zhanget al, 2006) integrates the flat features from entities and structured features from parse trees. $$$$$ Our study illustrates that the composite kernel can effectively capture both flat and structured features without the need for extensive feature engineering, and can also easily scale to include more features.

For the similarity matrix W in section 4.1 and the kernel K in section 4.2, we used the composite kernel function (Zhang et al, 2006), which is based on structured features and entity-related features. $$$$$ Section 3 discusses our composite kernel.
For the similarity matrix W in section 4.1 and the kernel K in section 4.2, we used the composite kernel function (Zhang et al, 2006), which is based on structured features and entity-related features. $$$$$ Moreover, the in-between word features and the entity-related features used in the feature-based methods are also captured by the tree kernel and the entity kernel, respectively.

For example, by combining tree kernels and convolution string kernels, (Zhang et al, 2006) achieved the state of the art performance on ACE (ACE, 2004), which is a benchmark dataset for relation extraction. $$$$$ For example, the kernels for structured natural language data, such as parse tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001), string kernel (Lodhi et al., 2002) and graph kernel (Suzuki et al., 2003) are example instances of the wellknown convolution kernels1 in NLP.

For comparison, we use the same setting as (Zhang et al, 2006), by applying a 5-fold cross-validation. $$$$$ Since Zhao and Grishman (2005) use a 5-fold cross-validation on a subset of the 2004 data (newswire and broadcast news domains, containing 348 documents and 4400 relation instances), for comparison, we use the same setting (5-fold cross-validation on the same subset of the 2004 data, but the 5 partitions may not be the same) for the ACE 2004 data.

We also compare our approaches to the other state-of-the-art approaches including Convolution Tree kernel (Collinsand Duffy, 2001), Syntactic kernel (Zhao and Grishman, 2005), Composite kernel (linear) (Zhang et al, 2006) and the best kernel in (Nguyen et al, 2009). $$$$$ The composite kernel consists of an entity kernel and a convolution parse tree kernel.

In (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a) dependency graph features are exploited, and in (Zhang et al, 2006a) syntactic features are employed for relation extraction. $$$$$ In relation extraction, typical work on kernel methods includes

For the first time, in (Zhang et al, 2006a), this convolution tree kernel was used for relation extraction. $$$$$ Zelenko et al. (2003) developed a kernel over parse trees for relation extraction.

The parameter of CD'01 kernel is set to 0.4 according to (Zhang et al., 2006a). $$$$$ According to the ACE Program, an entity is an object or set of objects in the world and a relation is an explicitly or implicitly stated relationship among entities.
The parameter of CD'01 kernel is set to 0.4 according to (Zhang et al., 2006a). $$$$$ Evaluation on the development set shows that this composite kernel yields the best performance when α is set to 0.4.

Although the path-enclosed tree portion (PT) (Zhang et al, 2006a) seems to be an appropriate portion of the syntactic tree for relation extraction, it only takes into account the syntactic information between the relation arguments, and discards many useful features (before and after the arguments features). $$$$$ Furthermore, we find that the small portion (PT) of a full parse tree can effectively represent a relation instance.

In fact, SPT (Zhang et al, 2006) can be arrived at by carrying out part of the above removal operations using a single rule (i.e. all the constituents outside the linking path should be removed) and CS-CSPT (Zhou et al, 2007) further recovers part of necessary context-sensitive information outside SPT, this justifies that SPT performs well, while CS-SPT outperforms SPT. $$$$$ Many techniques on relation extraction, such as rule-based (MUC, 1987-1998; Miller et al., 2000), feature-based (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al., 2005) and kernel-based (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), have been proposed in the literature.
