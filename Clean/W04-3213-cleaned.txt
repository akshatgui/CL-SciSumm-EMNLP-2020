Swier and Stevenson (2004) innovated with an unsupervised approach to the problem, using a boot strapping algorithm, and achieved 87% accuracy. $$$$$ Using an unsupervised algorithm for semantic role labelling, we have achieved 90% correct on identified arguments, well over an informed baseline of 77%, and have achieved 87% correct on all slots (64% baseline).

VerbNet and its semantic features have been used in a variety of NLP applications, such as semantic role labeling (Swier and Stevenson, 2004), inferencing (Zaenen et al, 2008), verb classification (Joanis et al, 2008), and information extraction (Maynard et al, 2009). $$$$$ Because of the importance of this task, a number of recent methods have been proposed for automatic semantic role labelling (e.g., Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Fleischman et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2003).

There has been little research on semi-supervised learning for SRL.We refer to He and Gildea (2006) who tested active learning and co-training methods, but found little or no gain from semi-supervised learning, and to Swier and Stevenson (2004), who achieved good results using semi-supervised methods, but tested their methods on a small number of Verb Net roles, which have not been used by other SRL systems. $$$$$ (Indeed, in comparing the use of FrameNet roles to general thematic roles, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) found very little difference in performance.)

This is achieved by adopting the scoring method of Swier and Stevenson (2004), in which we compute the portion Frame of frame slots that can be mapped to an extracted argument, and the portion% Sent of extracted arguments from the sentence that can be mapped to the frame. $$$$$ Throughout the paper we use the term “frame” to refer to a syntactic frame—the set of syntactic arguments of a verb—possibly labelled with roles, as exemplified in the VerbNet entry in Table 1.

For ease of comparison, we use the same verbs as in Swier and Stevenson (2004), except that we measure performance over a much larger superset of verbs. $$$$$ From the set of target verbs, we derived an extended verb set that comprises all of the original target verbs as well as any verb that shares a class with one of those target verbs.
