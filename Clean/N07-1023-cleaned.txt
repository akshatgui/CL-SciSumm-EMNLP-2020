Modifications of this model are reported in Turner and Charniak (2005) and Galley and McKeown (2007) with improved results. $$$$$ Some of them (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Turner and Charniak, 2005) take an empirical approach, relying on formalisms equivalent to probabilistic synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) (Lewis and Stearns, 1968; Aho and Ullman, 1969) to extract compression rules from aligned Penn Treebank (PTB) trees.
Modifications of this model are reported in Turner and Charniak (2005) and Galley and McKeown (2007) with improved results. $$$$$ We also exploited more general tree productions known as synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) rules, in an approach quite similar to (Turner and Charniak, 2005).

(Galley and McKeown, 2007) extended the noisy-channel approach and proposed a head-driven Markovization formulation of synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) deletion rules. $$$$$ We present a sentence compression system based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG), following the successful noisy-channel approach of (Knight and Marcu, 2000).

The last sentence compression method we use is the lexicalized Markov grammar-based approach (Galley and McKeown, 2007) with edit word detection (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Lexicalized Markov Grammars for Sentence Compression

Where the tree pairs are isomorphic, synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) may suffice, but in general, non-isomorphism can make the problem of rule extraction difficult (Galley and McKeown,2007). $$$$$ We present a sentence compression system based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG), following the successful noisy-channel approach of (Knight and Marcu, 2000).

We use the sentence pairs available in the Ziff-Davis Tree Alignment corpus (Galley and McKeown, 2007). $$$$$ To use sentence pairs with insertions and substitutions, we must find a way to align tree pairs in order to identify SCFG productions.

Rather than attempt to derive a new parse tree like Knight and Marcu (2000) and Galley and McKeown (2007), we learn to safely remove a set of constituents in our parse tree-based compression model while preserving grammatical structure and essential content. $$$$$ We present a sentence compression system based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG), following the successful noisy-channel approach of (Knight and Marcu, 2000).
