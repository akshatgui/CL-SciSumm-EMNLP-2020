The next set of lookup levels described, in which the structural word is no longer the primary entity but just a handle for indexing graphs, can be built on the basis of knowledge assembled from large volumes of text; the methodology employed by Smadja and McKeown (1990) would be one of many techniques possible for obtaining and organizing the various levels of model graphs. $$$$$ These affinities can not be predicted on the basis of semantic or syntactic rules, but can be observed with some regularity in text [Cruse 86].

Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ For example, in some cases, the words of a collocation must be adjacent, while in others they can be separated by a varying number of other words.
Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990). $$$$$ For the lexical relation average-industrial Xtract produces an open compound collocation as illustrated in figure 3.

 $$$$$ This is an expensive and time-consuming process, and often incomplete.
 $$$$$ We would like to thank Karen Kukich and the Computer Systems Research Division at Bell Communication Research for their help on the acquisition part of this work.

Previous studies have proposed many promising ways for this purpose, for instance, Smadja and McKeown (1990), and Frantzi and Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more general structures like collocations. $$$$$ In [Smadja 89a], and [Smadja 88], we detail an earlier version of Xtract and its output, and in [Smadja 89b] we compare our results both qualitatively and quantitatively to the lexicon used in [Kukich 83].
Previous studies have proposed many promising ways for this purpose, for instance, Smadja and McKeown (1990), and Frantzi and Ananiadou (1996) tried to treat more general structures like collocations. $$$$$ Collocations are flexible and they can involve two, three or more words in various ways.
