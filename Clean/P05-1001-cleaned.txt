To avoid terminological confusion, we refer throughout the paper to a specific structural learning method, alternating structural optimization (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a). $$$$$ This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning framework called structural learning (Ando and Zhang, 2004), which seeks to discover shared predictive structures (i.e. what good classifiers for the task are like) through jointly learning multiple classification problems on unlabeled data.
