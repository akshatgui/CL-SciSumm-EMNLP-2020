One could also expand the lexicon, by adapting algorithms for analyzing unknown words (e.g., Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ We put all the hapax words from the Brown Corpus that were found in the cELEx-derived lexicon into the test collection (test lexicon) and all other words from the cELEx-derived lexicon into the training lexicon.
One could also expand the lexicon, by adapting algorithms for analyzing unknown words (e.g., Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ Because of the similarities in the algorithms with the LISP implemented Xerox tagger, we could directly use the Xerox guessing rule set with the HMM tagger.

We have used LTPOS (Mikheev, 1997), which performed the task almost error less. $$$$$ There are a number of standard parameters (Lewis 1991) used for measuring performance on this kind of task.
We have used LTPOS (Mikheev, 1997), which performed the task almost error less. $$$$$ These words were not used in the training of the tagger either.

Step 6 contains a call to the other main LT TTT program, LTOPS (Mikheev, 1997), which performs both sentence identification and POS tagging. $$$$$ To see how well the guesser performs, we can compare the results of the guessing with the PUS-tags known to be true for the word (i.e., listed in the lexicon).
Step 6 contains a call to the other main LT TTT program, LTOPS (Mikheev, 1997), which performs both sentence identification and POS tagging. $$$$$ Our main interest is in how the advantage of one rule set over another will affect the tagging performance.

The search for such rules has previously been conducted in the context of supervised part-of-speech tagging (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ The task of unknown-word guessing is, however, a subtask of the overall part-of-speech tagging process.
The search for such rules has previously been conducted in the context of supervised part-of-speech tagging (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ Evaluation of tagging accuracy on unknown words using texts and words unseen at the training phase showed that tagging with the automatically induced cascading guesser was consistently more accurate than previously quoted results known to the author (85%).

Tagging and chunking is done by a standard tagger and chunker, LTPos (Mikheev,1997). $$$$$ We also tried hybrid tagging using the output of the HMM tagger as the input to Brill's final state tagger, but it gave poorer results than either of the taggers and we decided not to consider this tagging option.
Tagging and chunking is done by a standard tagger and chunker, LTPos (Mikheev,1997). $$$$$ In our tagging experiments, we measured the error rate of tagging on unknown words using different guessers.

The other main LT TTT program is ltpos, a statistical combined part-of-speech (POS) tagger and sentence boundary disambiguation module (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ However, some domain-specific words or infrequently used morphological variants of general-purpose words can be missing from the lexicon and thus, their Pos-classes should be guessed by the system and only then sent to the disambiguation module.
The other main LT TTT program is ltpos, a statistical combined part-of-speech (POS) tagger and sentence boundary disambiguation module (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ Mistagging of the first type occurred when a guesser provided a broader POS-class for an unknown word than a lexicon would, and the tagger had difficulties with its disambiguation.

The other main LT TTT program is ltpos, a statistical combined part-of-speech (POS) tagger and sentence identifier (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ This can be accounted for by the fact that the unguessed capitalized words were taken by default to be proper nouns and that the Brill tagger and the HMM tagger had slightly different strategies to apply to the first word of a sentence.
The other main LT TTT program is ltpos, a statistical combined part-of-speech (POS) tagger and sentence identifier (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ We have presented a technique for fully automated statistical acquisition of rules that guess possible POS-tags for words unknown to the lexicon.

PoS tagging can be performed using LTPOS (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ Therefore, we performed an evaluation of the impact of the word guessers on tagging accuracy.

A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ The two additional types of features used by Brill's guesser are implicitly represented in our approach as well: One of the Brill schemata checks the context of an unknown word.
A common approach is to extract word-internal features from unknown words, for example suffix, capitalization, or punctuation features (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ In our approach we guess the words using their features only and provide several possibilities for a word; then at the disambiguation phase the context is used to choose the right tag.

the possible part(s)-of-speech of unknown words (Mikheev,1997). $$$$$ In this paper we present a technique for fully automatic acquisition of rules that guess possible part-of-speech tags for unknown words using their starting and ending segments.

The next stage in the linguistic analysis module performs noun group and verb group chunking using fsg match with the specialised hand-written rule sets which were the core part of LT CHUNK (Finch and Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ Thus if the ending s predicts that a word can be a plural noun or a 3d form of a verb, the information that this word was capitalized can narrow the considered set of POS-tags to plural proper noun.
The next stage in the linguistic analysis module performs noun group and verb group chunking using fsg match with the specialised hand-written rule sets which were the core part of LT CHUNK (Finch and Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ There are two important questions that arise at the rule acquisition stage: how to choose the scoring threshold 0, and what the performance of the rule sets produced with different thresholds is.

The stripping-recoding rules could be manually encoded, mined from a monolingual corpus usinga learning method such as (Mikheev, 1997), or supplied by a source terminology extraction system that handles morphological variations. $$$$$ Three complimentary sets of word-guessing rules are statistically induced: prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules.

Following Mikheev (1997), we therefore adjust reliability using lower confidence limit statistics. $$$$$ We tackle this problem by calculating the lower confidence limit 711 for the rule estimate, which can be seen as the minimal expected value of p for the rule if we were to draw a large number of samples.
Following Mikheev (1997), we therefore adjust reliability using lower confidence limit statistics. $$$$$ It has two parameters: a, the level of confidence and df, the number of degrees of freedom, which is one less than the sample size (df = n -1). td(c_a)/2 can be looked up in the tables for the t-distribution listed in every textbook on statistics.

The identification of sentence boundaries, mark-up of sentence elements and POS tagging is done by the statistical program lt pos (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ Since a word can take on several different POS-tags, in the lexicon it can be represented as a [string/Pos-class] record, where the Pos-class is a set of one or more POS-tags.

Taggers based on Hidden Markoff Model (HMM) technology currently appear to be in the lead. The prime public domain examples of such implementations include the Trigrams'n'Tags tagger (Brandts 2000), Xerox tagger (Cutting et al. 1992) and LT POS tagger (Mikheev 1997). $$$$$ The Xerox tagger (Cutting et al. 1992) comes with a set of rules that assign an unknown word a set of possible POS-tags (i.e., Pos-class) on the basis of its ending segment.

The LT POS tagger is reported to perform at 93.6-94.3% accuracy on known words and at 87.7-88.7% on unknown words using a cascading unknown word 'guesser' (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ Tagging accuracy on unknown words using the cascading guesser was 87.7-88.7%.
The LT POS tagger is reported to perform at 93.6-94.3% accuracy on known words and at 87.7-88.7% on unknown words using a cascading unknown word 'guesser' (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ When the unknown words were made known to the lexicon, the accuracy of tagging was 93.6-94.3% which makes the accuracy drop caused by the cascading guesser to be less than 6% in general.

Mikheev (1997) suggested a guessing-rule technique, based on prefix morphological rules ,suffix morphological rules, and ending-guessing rules. $$$$$ Three complimentary sets of word-guessing rules are statistically induced: prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules.

Transitions to the normal and pivotal stage occur when an estimator of the relative frequency is high enough, for example by taking the lower bound of the confidence interval (Mikheev,1997). $$$$$ As argued in Church (1988), who proposes a more elaborated heuristic, Dermatas and Kokkinakis (1995) proposed a simple probabilistic approach to unknown-word guessing: verb present, 3d person verb, present, non-3d Example take took taking taken takes take Meaning Example Tag the probability that an unknown word has a particular POS-tag is estimated from the probability distribution of hapax words (words that occur only once) in the previously seen texts.'

Lexical knowledge (for unknown words) and the word lemma (for known words) provide, w.h.p, one sided error (Mikheev, 1997). $$$$$ The error rate for a category of words was calculated as follows: Total _Words _in _Set _X Wrongly _Tagged _Words _from _Set _X Thus, for instance, the error rate of tagging the unknown words is the proportion of the mistagged unknown words to all unknown words.
