Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective. $$$$$ The first (Section 3) investigates agreement between annotators who manually assign the labels subjective, objective, or both to WordNet senses.

We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ A general covering term for such states is private state, “a state that is not open to objective observation or verification” (Quirk et al., 1985).1 There are three main types of subjective expressions:2 His alarm grew.

As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ While these sentences contain objective senses of alarm and boil, the sentences are subjective nonetheless.
As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ Our hypothesis motivating the use of a sentence-level subjectivity classifier is that instances of subjective senses are more likely to be in subjective sentences, and thus that sentence subjectivity is an informative feature for the disambiguation of words having both subjective and objective senses.

Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) and Su and Markert (2008) both show that this is a well-defined concept via human annotation as well as automatic recognition. $$$$$ Encouraged by the results of the agreement study, we devised a method targeting the automatic annotation of word senses for subjectivity.
