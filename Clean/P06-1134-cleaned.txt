Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or objective. $$$$$ The first (Section 3) investigates agreement between annotators who manually assign the labels subjective, objective, or both to WordNet senses.

We follow Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) in that we see subjective expressions as private states that are not open to objective observation or verification. $$$$$ A general covering term for such states is private state, “a state that is not open to objective observation or verification” (Quirk et al., 1985).1 There are three main types of subjective expressions

We adopt the definitions from (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), who describe the annotation scheme as follows. $$$$$ In addition to S, O, and B, the annotation scheme also permits U(ncertain) tags.

As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ While these sentences contain objective senses of alarm and boil, the sentences are subjective nonetheless.
As noted in (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), sentences containing objective senses may not be objective. $$$$$ Our hypothesis motivating the use of a sentence-level subjectivity classifier is that instances of subjective senses are more likely to be in subjective sentences, and thus that sentence subjectivity is an informative feature for the disambiguation of words having both subjective and objective senses.

Both (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006) and (SuandMarkert, 2008) show that even reliable subjectivity clues have objective senses. $$$$$ The results of this experiment show that a subjectivity feature can significantly improve the accuracy of a word sense disambiguation system for those words that have both subjective and objective senses.

Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) and Su and Markert (2008) both show that this is a well-defined concept via human annotation as well as automatic recognition. $$$$$ Encouraged by the results of the agreement study, we devised a method targeting the automatic annotation of word senses for subjectivity.
