(Callison-Burch et al, 2007) reported that the inter coder agreement on the task of assigning ranks to a given set of candidate hypotheses is much better than the intercoder agreement on the task of assigning a score to a hypothesis in isolation. $$$$$ The agreement on the other two types of manual evaluation that we introduced were considerably better.

While this single-scale relative ranking is perhaps faster to annotate and reaches a higher inter and intra-annotator agreement than the (absolute) fluency and adequacy (Callison-Burch et al, 2007), the technique and its evaluation are still far from satisfactory. $$$$$ For intra-annotator agreement we did similarly, but gathered items that were annotated on multiple occasions by a single annotator.

The Moses system with a 4-gram language model and a distance-6 lexical reordering model ("lex RO") scores similarly to state-of-the-art systems of this type on the test 2007 French English data (Callison-Burch et al, 2007). $$$$$ j schroeder ed ac uk Abstract This paper evaluates the translation quality of machine translation systems for 8 language pairs

This behavior appears to be consistent on the test 2007 and nc-test2007 data sets across systems (Callison-Burch et al, 2007). $$$$$ This year’s data included training and development sets for the News Commentary data, which was the surprise outof-domain test set last year.

Although BLEU has played a crucial role in the progress of MT research, it is becoming evident that BLEU does not correlate with human judgement well enough, and suffers from several other deficiencies such as the lack of an intuitive interpretation of its scores. During the recent ACL-07 workshop on statistical MT (Callison-Burch et al, 2007), a total of automatic MT evaluation metrics were evaluated for correlation with human judgement. $$$$$ We measured the correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with human judgments.

Different from Callison-Burch et al (2007), where Spear man's correlation coefficients were used, we use here Pearson's coefficients as, instead of focusing on ranking; this first evaluation exercise focuses on evaluating the significance and noisiness of the association, if any, between the automatic metrics and human-generated scores. $$$$$ We measured the correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with human judgments.

We opted for Spearman rather than Pearson because it makes fewer assumptions about the data.

Human evaluation is also often quantitative, for instance in the form of estimates of values such as adequacy and fluency, or by ranking sentences from different systems (e.g. Callison-Burch et al (2007)). $$$$$ We define chance agreement for fluency and adequacy as 5, since they are based on five point scales, and for ranking as s since there are three possible out comes when ranking the output of a pair of systems

Though it does, at least in principle, seem possible to mine HTER annotations for more information system comparison (Callison-Burch et al, 2007), and word alignment (Ahrenberg et al, 2003). $$$$$ The phrases in the translations were located using techniques from phrase-based statistical machine translation which extract phrase pairs from word alignments (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).
