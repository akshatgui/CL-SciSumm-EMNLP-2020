Parallel texts have recently received considerable attention in machine translation (e.g., Brown et al 1990). $$$$$ Statistical methods have proven their value in automatic speech recognition (Bahl et al. 1983) and have recently been applied to lexicography (Sinclair 1985) and to natural language processing (Baker 1979; Ferguson 1980; Garside et al.

They are used in many applications, e.g. word prediction (Bickel et al, 2005), speech recognition (Rabiner and Juang, 1993), machine translation (Brown et al, 1990). $$$$$ We used a trigram language model that had been constructed for a speech recognition system.

Systems for automatic translation between languages have been divided into transfer-based approaches, which rely on interpreting the source string into an abstract semantic representation from which text is generated in the target language, and statistical approaches, pioneered by Brown et al (1990), which estimate parameters for a model of word-to-word correspondences and word re-orderings directly from large corpora of parallel bilingual text. $$$$$ Given a word string, s is2 .

The second method proposed by RALI is based on a dynamic programming scheme which uses a score function derived from a translation model similar to that of (Brown et al, 1990). $$$$$ Thus, as illustrated in Figure 1, a statistical translation system requires a method for computing language model probabilities, a method for computing translation probabilities, and, finally, a method for searching among possible source sentences S for the one that gives the greatest value for Pr(S )Pr(T1 S ).

For example, when considering whether to align two words in the IBM models (Brown et al, 1990), one can not easily include information about such features as orthographic similarity (for detecting cognates), presence of the pair in various dictionaries, similarity of the frequency of the two words, choices made by other alignment systems on this sentence pair, and so on. $$$$$ Sometimes, words in the English sentence of the pair align with nothing in the French sentence, and similarly, occasionally words in the French member of the pair do not appear to go with any of the words in the English sentence.
