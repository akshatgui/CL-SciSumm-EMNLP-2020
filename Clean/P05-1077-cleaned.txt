The frequency statistics were weighted using mutual information, as in Ravichandran et al (2005). $$$$$ We first construct a frequency count vector C(e) = (ce1, ce2, ..., cek), where k is the total number of features and cef is the frequency count of feature f occurring in word e. Here, cef is the number of times word e occurred in context f. We then construct a mutual information vector MI(e) = (mie1, mie2, ..., miek) for each word e, where mief is the pointwise mutual information between word e and feature f, which is defined as
