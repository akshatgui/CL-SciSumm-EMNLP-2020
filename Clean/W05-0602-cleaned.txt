SCISSOR (Ge and Mooney, 2005), a system that learns an integrated syntactic-semantic parser. $$$$$ A Statistical Semantic Parser That Integrates Syntax And Semantics
SCISSOR (Ge and Mooney, 2005), a system that learns an integrated syntactic-semantic parser. $$$$$ It first usesan integrated statistical parser to pro duce a semantically augmented parse tree, in which each non-terminal node has both a syntactic and a semantic label.

Figure 6 shows the performance of WASP com pared to four other algorithms $$$$$ Training the system requires sentences an notated with both gold-standard SAPT?s and MR?s. We present experimental results on corpora for bothgeography-database querying and Robocup coaching demonstrating that SCISSOR produces more accurate semantic representations than several previ ous approaches based on symbolic learning (Tang and Mooney, 2001; Kate et al, 2005).

Of course, other annotations (Ge and Mooney, 2005) carry more explicit forms of semantics. $$$$$ A Statistical Semantic Parser That Integrates Syntax And Semantics
Of course, other annotations (Ge and Mooney, 2005) carry more explicit forms of semantics. $$$$$ A compositional-semantics procedure is then used to map the augmented parse tree into a final meaning representation.

Ge and Mooney (2005) introduced an approach, SCISSOR, where the composition of meaning representations is guided by syntax. $$$$$ Our approach is implemented in a system called SCISSOR (Semantic Composition that IntegratesSyntax and Semantics to get Optimal Representations).

Ge and Mooney also presented a statistical method (Ge and Mooney, 2005) by merging syn tactic and semantic information. $$$$$ A Statistical Semantic Parser That Integrates Syntax And Semantics
Ge and Mooney also presented a statistical method (Ge and Mooney, 2005) by merging syn tactic and semantic information. $$$$$ By in tegrating syntax and semantics in a single statisticalparser that produces an SAPT, we can use both se mantic information to resolve syntactic ambiguitiesand syntactic information to resolve semantic ambi guities.

Structure representation A tree structure representation incorporated with semantic and syntactic information is named semantically augmented parse tree (SAPT) (Ge and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ It first usesan integrated statistical parser to pro duce a semantically augmented parse tree, in which each non-terminal node has both a syntactic and a semantic label.
