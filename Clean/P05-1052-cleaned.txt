Also using kernel methods and support vector machines, (Zhao and Grishman, 2005) combine clues from different levels of syntactic information and applies composite kernels to integrate the individual kernels. $$$$$ Then composite kernels are developed to integrate and extend individual kernels so that processing errors occurring at one level can be overcome by information from other levels.
