Recognizing textual entailment is to determine whether a sentence (sometimes a short paragraph) can entail the other sentence (Giampiccolo et al, 2007). $$$$$ The Third PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge
Recognizing textual entailment is to determine whether a sentence (sometimes a short paragraph) can entail the other sentence (Giampiccolo et al, 2007). $$$$$ Then they picked sentence pairs with high lexical overlap, preferably where at least one of the sentences was taken from the summary (this sentence usually played the role of t).

The average accuracy of the systems in the RTE-3 challenge is around 61% (Giampiccolo et al, 2007). $$$$$ In fact, the average accuracy achieved in the QA setting (0.71) was 20 points higher than that achieved in the IE setting (0.52); the average accuracy in the IR and Sum settings was 0.66 and 0.58 respectively.

For example, the best systems in RTE2 and RTE3 (Giampiccolo et al, 2007) have an accuracy 10% higher than the others but they generally use resources that are not publicly available. $$$$$ However, as in RTE-2, the use of large semantic resources is still a crucial factor affecting the performance of systems (see, for instance, the use of a large corpus of entailment examples in Hickl and Bensley).

These features include whether the two strings are the same, two terms have the same stem, the similarity between the two terms either based on WordNet or distributional statistics (Lin, 1998). To learn the alignment model for nouns, we annotated the noun alignments for the development data used in PASCAL RTE-3 Challenge (Giampiccolo et al., 2007) and trained a logistic regression model based on the features in Table 1. $$$$$ On the other hand, RTE-3 confirmed that both machine learning using lexical-syntactic features and transformation-based approaches on dependency representations are well consolidated techniques to address textual entailment.

A first step towards a more comprehensive notion of entailment was taken with RTE-3 (Giampiccolo et al,2007), when paragraph-length texts were first included and constituted 17% of the texts in the test set. $$$$$ In particular, a limited number of longer texts, i.e. up to a paragraph in length, were incorporated in order to move toward more comprehensive scenarios, which incorporate the need for discourse analysis.

For semantically oriented tools such as SRL systems, it is important to also assess their results w.r.t. the task which they are meant support namely reasoning $$$$$ For the QA (Question Answering) task, annotators used questions taken from the datasets of official QA competitions, such as TREC QA and QA@CLEF datasets, and the corresponding answers extracted from the Web by actual QA systems.

Given text T and hypothesis H, the task consists on determining whether or not H can be inferred by T (Giampiccolo et al, 2007). CSR axioms Several examples of the RTE3challenge can be solved by applying CSR (Table 5). The rest of this section depicts the axioms involved in detecting entailment for each pair. $$$$$ In choosing the pairs, the following judgment criteria and guidelines were considered

Textual Entailment (TE) has recently become a prominent paradigm for modeling semantic inference, capturing the needs of a broad range of text understanding applications (Giampiccolo et al., 2007). $$$$$ The textual entailment recognition task required the participating systems to decide, given two text snippets t and h, whether t entails h. Textual entailment is defined as a directional relation between two text fragments, called text (t, the entailing text), and hypothesis (h, the entailed text), so that a human being, with common understanding of language and common background knowledge, can infer that h is most likely true on the basis of the content of t. As in the previous challenges, the RTE-3 dataset consisted of 1600 text-hypothesis pairs, equally divided into a development set and a test set.
