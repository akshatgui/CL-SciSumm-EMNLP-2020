Subsequently, we replicated Gildea's experiment with a complete emulation of Model 2 and presented additional evidence that bilexical statistics were barely getting used during decoding (Bikel, 2004), appearing to confirm the original result. $$$$$ In other words, Gildea removed all bilexical statistics from the overall model.
Subsequently, we replicated Gildea's experiment with a complete emulation of Model 2 and presented additional evidence that bilexical statistics were barely getting used during decoding (Bikel, 2004), appearing to confirm the original result. $$$$$ Combined with the results from the previous experiment, this suggests rather convincingly that such statistics are far less significant than once thought to the overall discriminative power of Collins’ models, confirming Gildea’s result for Model 2.36 If not bilexical statistics, then surely, one might think, head-choice is critical to the performance of a head-driven lexicalized statistical parsing model.

Subsequently, we duplicated Gildea's experiment with a complete emulation of Collins' Model 2, and found that when the decoder requested a smoothed estimate involving a bigram when testing on held-out data, it only received an estimate that made use of bilexical statistics a mere 1.49% of the time (Bikel, 2004). $$$$$ In other words, Gildea removed all bilexical statistics from the overall model.

The results of (Bikel, 2004) suggested that the power of Collins-style parsing models did not lie primarily with the use of bilexical dependencies as was once thought, but in lexico-structural dependencies, that is, predicting syntactic structures conditioning on head words. $$$$$ In addition to the effects of the unpublished details, we also have new evidence to show that the discriminative power of Collins’ model does not lie where once thought

Furthermore, the work in this paper relates to Bikel (2004)'s work. $$$$$ There are three primary motivations for this work.

For Chinese, we experimented on the Penn Chinese Treebank 4.0 (CTB4) (Palmer et al, 2004) and we used the rules in (Bikel, 2004) for conversion. $$$$$ These confidence values can be derived in a number of sensible ways; the technique used by Collins was adapted from that used in Bikel et al. (1997), which makes use of a quantity called the diversity of the history context (Witten and Bell 1991), which is equal to the number of unique futures observed in training for that history context.

They were then parsed using Bikel's parser (Bikel,2004) and corrected by hand using the Penn Tree bank Bracketing Guidelines (Bies et al, 1995). $$$$$ There are two reasons to remove these types of subtrees when parsing the English Treebank

Conditioning on crossing punctuation could be of help then, playing a role similar to that of comma-counting (Collins, 1997, §2.1) — and 'verb intervening' (Bikel, 2004, §5.1) - in early head-outward models for supervised parsing. $$$$$ Finally, the intervening punctuation is generated conditioning on the parent, the head, and the right conjunct, including the headwords of the two conjoined phrases, and the intervening CC is similarly generated.

We used Bikel's reimplementation of Collins' parsing model 2 (Bikel, 2004). $$$$$ Recently, in order to continue our work combining word sense with parsing (Bikel 2000) and the study of language-dependent and -independent parsing features (Bikel and Chiang 2000), we built a multilingual parsing engine that is capable of instantiating a wide variety of generative statistical parsing models (Bikel 2002).1 As an appropriate baseline model, we chose to instantiate the parameters of Collins’ Model 2.
We used Bikel's reimplementation of Collins' parsing model 2 (Bikel, 2004). $$$$$ First, Collins’ parsing model represents a widely used and cited parsing model.

Our best performing model incorporates three dimensions of parametrization and our best result (75.25%) is similar to the one obtained by the parser of (Bikel, 2004) for Modern Standard Arabic (75%) using a fully lexicalized model and a training corpus about three times as large as our newest MH tree bank. $$$$$ For example, Gildea (2001) reimplemented Collins’ Model 1 but obtained results with roughly 16.7% more relative error than Collins’ reported results using that model.

This was followed by (Bikel, 2004) who showed that bilexical-information is used in only 1.49% of the decisions in Collins' Model-2 parser, and that removing this information results in an exceedingly small drop in performance. $$$$$ This article documents a large set of heretofore unpublished details Collins used in his parser, such that, along with Collins’ (1999) thesis, this article contains all information necessary to duplicate Collins’ benchmark results.
This was followed by (Bikel, 2004) who showed that bilexical-information is used in only 1.49% of the decisions in Collins' Model-2 parser, and that removing this information results in an exceedingly small drop in performance. $$$$$ Without bigrams, performance drops only to 89.49% on recall, 89.95% on precision— an exceedingly small drop in performance (see Table 8, Model Mtw,t).

We use 2-best parse trees of Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) and 1-best parse tree of Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004) and Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) as inputs to the full parsing based system. $$$$$ Every headword in a lexicalized parse tree is the modifier of some other headword—except the word that is the head of the entire sentence (i.e., the headword of the root nonterminal).

This can be seen in state-of-the-art constituency-based parsers such as Collins (1999), Charniak (2000), and Petrov et al (2006), and the effects of different transformations have been studied by Johnson (1998), Klein and Manning (2003), and Bikel (2004). $$$$$ Recently, in order to continue our work combining word sense with parsing (Bikel 2000) and the study of language-dependent and -independent parsing features (Bikel and Chiang 2000), we built a multilingual parsing engine that is capable of instantiating a wide variety of generative statistical parsing models (Bikel 2002).1 As an appropriate baseline model, we chose to instantiate the parameters of Collins’ Model 2.

Collins's statistical parser (CBP; (Collins, 1997)), improved by Bikel (Bikel, 2004), is based on the probabilities between head-words in parse trees. $$$$$ All parameters that generate trees in Collins’ model are estimates of conditional probabilities.

The English sentences were parsed using the Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004), and the sentences were aligned with GIZA++ (Och and Ney,2000). $$$$$ Recently, in order to continue our work combining word sense with parsing (Bikel 2000) and the study of language-dependent and -independent parsing features (Bikel and Chiang 2000), we built a multilingual parsing engine that is capable of instantiating a wide variety of generative statistical parsing models (Bikel 2002).1 As an appropriate baseline model, we chose to instantiate the parameters of Collins’ Model 2.
