Since the raw Penn Treebank data contains many inconsistencies in its annotations (cf.

For both tree banks, we convert from constituent to dependency format using pennconverter (Johansson and Nugues, 2007), and generate POS tags using the MXPOST tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). $$$$$ The parameters {p, ai , • .. , } are then chosen to maximize the likelihood of the training data using p

This may stem from the differences between the two models &apos; feature templates, thresholds, and approximations of the expected values for the features, as discussed in the beginning of the section, or may just reflect differences in the choice of training and test sets (which are not precisely specified in Ratnaparkhi (1996)). $$$$$ The model generates the space of features by scanning each pair (hi ,ti) in the training data with the feature &quot;templates&quot; given in Table 1.

One conclusion that we can draw is that at present the additional word features used in Ratnaparkhi (1996) looking at words more than one position away from the current do not appear to be helping the overall performance of the models. $$$$$ The Maximum Entropy model allows arbitrary binary-valued features on the context, so it can use additional specialized, i.e., word-specific, features to correctly tag the &quot;residue&quot; that the baseline features cannot model.

Some are the result of inconsistency in labeling in the training data (Ratnaparkhi 1996), which usually reflects a lack of linguistic clarity or determination of the correct part of speech in context. $$$$$ A Maximum Entropy Model For Part-Of-Speech Tagging
Some are the result of inconsistency in labeling in the training data (Ratnaparkhi 1996), which usually reflects a lack of linguistic clarity or determination of the correct part of speech in context. $$$$$ The lack of improvement implies that either the feature set is still impoverished, or that the training data is inconsistent.

Following previous work (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), we assume that the tag of a word is independent of the tags of all preceding words given the tags of the previous two words (i.e.,? =2 in the equation above). $$$$$ A feature, given (h,t), may activate on any word or tag in the history h, and must encode any information that might help predict t, such as the spelling of the current word, or the identity of the previous two tags.
