The current state-of-the-art segmentation software developed by (Low et al, 2005), which ranks as the best in the SIGHAN bakeoff (Emerson, 2005), attains word precision and recall of 96.9% and 96.8%, respectively, on the PKU track. $$$$$ The columns R, P, and F show the recall, precision, and F mea- sure, respectively.

Those for the 4-tag set, adopted from (Xue, 2003) and (Low et al., 2005), include C−2, C−1, C0, C1, C2, C−2C−1, C−1C0, C−1C1, C0C1 and C1C2. $$$$$ Our implementation used the opennlp maximum entropy package v2.1.0 from sourceforge.1 1.1 Basic Features The basic features of our word segmenter are similar to our previous work (Ng and Low, 2004)

Third, the post processing method (Low et al, 2005) is employed to enhance the unknown word segmentation. $$$$$ After word segmentation is done by the maxi- mum entropy classifier, a post-processing step is applied to correct inconsistently segmented words made up of 3 or more characters.

Briefly, after ensuring the corpora were sentence-aligned, we tokenized the English texts and performed word segmentation on the Chinese texts (Low et al, 2005). $$$$$ 1.3 Additional Training Corpora The presence of different standards in Chinese word segmentation limits the amount of training corpora available for the community, due to dif- ferent organizations preparing training corpora in their own standards.

Much of this can be attributed to the value of using an external dictionary and additional training data, as illustrated by the experiments run by Low et al (2005) with their model. $$$$$ We ad- dress the problem of OOV words in two ways

It should be noted that in our testing during development, even when we strove to create a system which matched as closely as possible the one described by Low et al (2005), we were unable to achieve scores for the 2005 bakeoff data as high as their system did. $$$$$ 2 Testing During testing, the probability of a boundary tag sequence assignment t1 .
