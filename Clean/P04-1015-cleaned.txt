We used an early update version of averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins and Roark, 2004) for training of shift-reduce and top-down parsers. $$$$$ As a final note, following Collins (2002), we used the averaged parameters from the training algorithm in decoding test examples in our experiments.

Although we have not discussed it to this point, (Collins and Roark, 2004) present a perceptron algorithm for use with the Roark architecture. $$$$$ We then built a generative model with this feature set and the same tree transform, for use with the beam-search parser from Roark (2004) to compare against our baseline perceptron model.

Hence we use a beam-search decoder during training and testing; our idea is similar to that of Collins and Roark (2004) who used a beam-search decoder as part of a perceptron parsing model. $$$$$ A beam-search algorithm is used during both training and decoding phases of the method.

Shen et al (2007) have further shown that better results (97.3% accuracy) can be obtained using guided learning, a framework for bidirectional sequence classification, which integrates token classification and inference order selection into a single learning task and uses a perceptron-like (Collins and Roark, 2004) passive-aggressive classifier to make the easiest decisions first. $$$$$ The learning task is to set the parameter values α¯ using the training examples as evidence.

Early update was introduced by Collins and Roark (2004) for incremental parsing and adopted to forest re-ranking by Wang and Zong (2011). $$$$$ This paper explores an alternative approach to parsing, based on the perceptron training algorithm introduced in Collins (2002).

We also show, in Section 3.3, how perceptron training with early update (Collins and Roark, 2004) can be used in this setting. $$$$$ Figure 5 shows the convergence of the training algorithm with neither of the two refinements presented; with just early update; and with both.

The normal-form model of Zhang and Clark (2011) uses an early update mechanism (Collins and Roark, 2004), where decoding is stopped to update model weights whenever the single gold action falls outside the beam. $$$$$ We describe an approach that uses an incremental, left-to-right parser, with beam search, to find the highest scoring analysis under the model.

Here, it might be useful to relax the strict linear control regime by exploring beam search strategies, e.g. along the lines of Collins and Roark (2004). $$$$$ The parser is an incremental beam-search parser very similar to the sort described in Roark (2001a; 2004), with some changes in the search strategy to accommodate the perceptron feature weights.

We apply the early update strategy (Collins and Roark, 2004), stopping parsing for parameter updates when the gold standard state item falls off the agenda. $$$$$ As before, define yi to be the gold standard parse for the i’th sentence, and also define yji to be the partial analysis under the gold-standard parse for the first j words of the i’th sentence.
We apply the early update strategy (Collins and Roark, 2004), stopping parsing for parameter updates when the gold standard state item falls off the agenda. $$$$$ This is likely to lead to less noisy input to the parameter estimation algorithm; and early update will also improve efficiency, as at the early stages of training the parser will frequently give up after a small proportion of each sentence is processed.

Strategy of Collins and Roark (2004) is used $$$$$ Unlike in Roark (2001a; 2004), there is no look-ahead statistic, so we modified the feature set from those papers to explicitly include the lexical item and POS tag of the next word.
Strategy of Collins and Roark (2004) is used $$$$$ First, the model is updated as usual with the current example, which is then added to a cache of examples.

Collins and Roark (2004) proposed the early-update idea, and Huang et al (2012) later proved its convergence and formalized a general framework which includes it as a special case. $$$$$ Examples of such techniques are Markov Random Fields (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Abney, 1997; Della Pietra et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 1999), and boosting or perceptron approaches to reranking (Freund et al., 1998; Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2002).

The best results of Collins and Roark (2004) (LR=88.4%, LP=89.1% and F=88.8%) are achieved when the parser utilizes the information about the final punctuation and the look-ahead. $$$$$ Unlike in Roark (2001a; 2004), there is no look-ahead statistic, so we modified the feature set from those papers to explicitly include the lexical item and POS tag of the next word.
