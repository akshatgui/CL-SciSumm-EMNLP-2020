Recent work in this area includes Velikovich et al (2010), who developed a method for automatically deriving an extensive sentiment lexicon from the web as a whole. $$$$$ We examine the viability of building large polarity lexicons semi-automatically from the web.
Recent work in this area includes Velikovich et al (2010), who developed a method for automatically deriving an extensive sentiment lexicon from the web as a whole. $$$$$ Towards this end, we provide both a qualitative and quantitative analysis for a web-derived English lexicon relative to two previously published lexicons â€“ the lexicon used in Wilson et al. (2005) and the lexicon used in Blair-Goldensohn et al.

We examine two methods for sentiment detection that of Brody and Elhadad (2010) for detecting sentiment in reviews, and that of Velikovich et al (2010) for finding sentiment terms in a giga-scale web corpus. $$$$$ Thus, the method we investigate can be seen as a combination of methods for propagating sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for building sentiment lexicons based on distributional characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002).
We examine two methods for sentiment detection that of Brody and Elhadad (2010) for detecting sentiment in reviews, and that of Velikovich et al (2010) for finding sentiment terms in a giga-scale web corpus. $$$$$ In particular, we might see a number of edges between positive and negative sentiment words as well as sentiment words and non-sentiment words, e.g., sentiment adjectives and all other adjectives that are distributionally similar.

Velikovich et al (2010) constructed a graph where the nodes were 20 million candidate words or phrases, selected using a set of heuristics including frequency and mutual information of word boundaries. $$$$$ This list was filtered to 20 million candidate phrases using a number of heuristics including frequency and mutual information of word boundaries.
Velikovich et al (2010) constructed a graph where the nodes were 20 million candidate words or phrases, selected using a set of heuristics including frequency and mutual information of word boundaries. $$$$$ We ran the best path graph propagation algorithm over a graph constructed from the web using manually constructed positive and negative seed sets of 187 and 192 words in size, respectively.

On the other hand, the method of Velikovich et al (2010) is based on huge amounts of data, and takes advantage of the abundance of contextual information available in full documents, whereas our domain is closer to that of Brody and Elhadad (2010), who dealt with a small number of candidates and short documents typical to online reviews. $$$$$ In this work we investigate the viability of polarity lexicons that are derived solely from unlabeled web documents.

Once the graph is constructed, we can use either of the propagation algorithms of Brody and Elhadad (2010) and Velikovich et al (2010), which we will denote Reviews and Web, respectively. $$$$$ In this section we describe a method to construct polarity lexicons using graph propagation over a phrase similarity graph constructed from the web.

Velikovich et al (2010) employed a different label propagation method, as described in Figure 3. $$$$$ The specific algorithm used in this study is given in Figure 1, which is distinct from common graph propagation algorithms, e.g., label propagation (see Section 2.3).

Although such an assumption played a key role in previous work for the analogous task of learning sentiment lexicon (Velikovich et al, 2010), we expect that the same assumption would be less reliable in drawing subtle connotative sentiments of words. $$$$$ In particular, we might see a number of edges between positive and negative sentiment words as well as sentiment words and non-sentiment words, e.g., sentiment adjectives and all other adjectives that are distributionally similar.

Velikovich et al (2010) use graph propagation algorithms for constructing a web-scale polarity lexicon for sentiment analysis. $$$$$ The pervasiveness and sustained use of lexicons can be ascribed to a number of reasons, including their interpretability in large-scale systems as well as the granularity of their analysis.
Velikovich et al (2010) use graph propagation algorithms for constructing a web-scale polarity lexicon for sentiment analysis. $$$$$ Our experiments show that a web-derived lexicon is not only significantly larger, but has improved accuracy on a sentence polarity classification task, which is an important problem in many sentiment analysis applications, including sentiment aggregation and summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004; Carenini et al., 2006; Lerman et al., 2009).

A technique named label propagation (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) has been used by Rao and Ravichandran (2009) and Velikovich et al (2010), while random walk based approaches, PageRank in particular, have been used by Esuli and Sebastiani (2007). $$$$$ Past studies on building polarity lexicons have used linguistic resources like WordNet to define the graph through synonym and antonym relations (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).

However in recent years, sentiment lexicons started expanding to include some of those words that simply associate with sentiment, even if those words are purely objective (e.g., Velikovich et al (2010), Baccianellaet al (2010)). $$$$$ In particular, we might see a number of edges between positive and negative sentiment words as well as sentiment words and non-sentiment words, e.g., sentiment adjectives and all other adjectives that are distributionally similar.

In order to collectively induce the visually descriptive words from this graph, we apply the graph propagation algorithm of Velikovich et al (2010), a variant of label propagation algorithms (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) that has been shown to be effective for inducing a web-scale polarity lexicon based on word co-occurrence statistics. $$$$$ The specific algorithm used in this study is given in Figure 1, which is distinct from common graph propagation algorithms, e.g., label propagation (see Section 2.3).

A web-derived lexicon (Velikovich et al, 2010) was constructed for all words and phrases using graph propagation algorithm which propagates polarity from seed words to all other words. $$$$$ Thus, even if some local edges are erroneous in the graph, one hopes that, globally, positive phrases will be influenced more by paths from positive seed words as opposed to negative seed words.
