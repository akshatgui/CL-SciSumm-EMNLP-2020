We parse the English sentences with the Charniak Parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), and tag the Chinese sentences with a POS tagger implemented faithfully according to (Collins, 2002) and trained on the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0 (Xue et al., 2005). $$$$$ We used these parses as the input to a MaxEnt reranker (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002) that selects the best parse from the set of parses for each sentence, obtaining an f-score of 91.0% on sentences of length 100 or less.

This is similar to the pruning described in Charniak and Johnson (2005) where edges in a coarse-grained parse forest are pruned to allow full evaluation with fine grained categories. $$$$$ By “coarse-to-fine” we mean that it first produces a crude version of the parse using coarse-grained dynamic programming states, and then builds fine-grained analyses by splitting the most promising of coarse-grained states.
This is similar to the pruning described in Charniak and Johnson (2005) where edges in a coarse-grained parse forest are pruned to allow full evaluation with fine grained categories. $$$$$ The unpruned edges are then exhaustively evaluated according to the fine-grained probabilistic model; in effect, each coarse-grained dynamic programming state is split into one or more fine-grained dynamic programming states.

Standard state-of-the-art parsing systems (e.g., Charniak and Johnson, 2005) typically involve two passes. $$$$$ Further, the nth-best parse can only involve at most n suboptimal parsing decisions, and all but one of these must be involved in one of the second through the n−1th-best parses.

We experimented with three scenarios; in two of them we trained using the gold standard trees and then tested on gold standard parse trees (GoldGold), and text annotated using a state-of-the-art statistical parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) (Gold Charniak), respectively. $$$$$ We evaluated the performance of our reranking parser using the standard PARSEVAL metrics.

We adapt the maximum entropy reranker from Charniak and Johnson (2005) by creating a customized feature extractor for event structures - in all other ways, the reranker model is unchanged. $$$$$ So a feature extractor maps each y to a vector of feature values f(y) = (f1(y), ..., fm(y)).

To train the classifiers, we used parse trees from the Charniak and Johnson (2005) parser with the same feature representation as in the original system. $$$$$ The 50-best parser is a probabilistic parser that on its own produces high quality parses; the maximum probability parse trees (according to the parser’s model) have an f-score of 0.897 on section 23 of the Penn Treebank (Charniak, 2000), which is still state-of-the-art.

Given a tree pair (f, c), whose respective parses (pif ,pic) were generated by the parser described in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), the goal is to transform the tree pair into SCFG derivations, in order to build relative frequency estimates for our Markovized models from observed SCFG productions. $$$$$ Indeed, Collins’s n-best list of parses for section 24 of the Penn tree-bank has some sentences with only a single parse, because the n-best parser could not find any parses.
