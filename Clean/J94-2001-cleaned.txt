Work similar to that described here has been carried out by Merialdo (1994), with broadly similar conclusions. $$$$$ The reasons for this preference are presumably that

Similar results are presented by Merialdo (1994), who describes experiments to compare the effect of training from a hand-tagged corpora and using the Baum-Welch algorithm with various initial conditions. $$$$$ Experiments show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as possible.

We adopt the problem formulation of Merialdo (1994), in which we are given a dictionary of possible tags for each word type. $$$$$ However, if we have a dictionary that specifies the list of possible tags for each word, we can use this information to constrain the model

Research into unsupervised part-of-speech tagging with a tag dictionary (sometimes called weakly supervised POS tagging) has been going on for many years Merialdo (1994). $$$$$ In this paper we present some experiments on the use of a probabilistic model to tag English text, i.e. to assign to each word the correct tag (part of speech) in the context of the sentence.

We also did not consider morphological analyzers as a form of type supervision, as suggested by Merialdo (1994). $$$$$ Consider a sentence W = w1w2 wn, and a sequence of tags T =-- tit2 tn, of the same length.

Advanced students might also want to read about a modern supervised trigram tagger (Brants, 2000), or the mixed results when one actually trains trigram taggers by EM (Merialdo, 1994). $$$$$ In some sense, this is an optimal dictionary for this data, since a word will not have all its possible tags (in the language), but only the tags that it actually had within the text.

For instance, Merialdo (1994) uses maximum likelihood estimation to train a trigram HMM. $$$$$ This is possible since the FB algorithm is able to train the model using the word sequence only.

Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging Since the work of Merialdo (1994), the HMM has been the model of choice for unsupervised tagging (Banko and Moore, 2004). $$$$$ Tagging English Text With A Probabilistic Model
Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging Since the work of Merialdo (1994), the HMM has been the model of choice for unsupervised tagging (Banko and Moore, 2004). $$$$$ In this case, all alignments for a sentence are equally probable, so that the choice of the correct tag is just a choice at random.

EM was first used in POS tagging in (Merialdo, 1994) which showed that except in conditions where there are no labeled training data at all, EM performs very poorly. $$$$$ They also show that Maximum Likelihood training, the procedure that is routinely used to estimate hidden Markov models parameters from training data, will not necessarily improve the tagging accuracy.

We adopt the problem formulation of Merialdo (1994), in which we are given a raw word sequence and a dictionary of legal tags for each word type. $$$$$ However, if we have a dictionary that specifies the list of possible tags for each word, we can use this information to constrain the model

Previous results on unsupervised POS tagging using a dictionary (Merialdo, 1994) on the full 45-tag set. $$$$$ The only constraints in this model came from the values k(w It) that were set to zero when the tag t was not possible for the word w (as found in the dictionary).
Previous results on unsupervised POS tagging using a dictionary (Merialdo, 1994) on the full 45-tag set. $$$$$ As in the previous experiment, the results in Table 5 show the number of tagging errors when the model is trained with the standard or t-constrained ML training.

The basic engine used to perform the tagging in these experiments is a direct descendent of the maximum entropy (ME) tagger of (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) which in turn is related to the taggers of (Kupiec, 1992) and (Merialdo, 1994). $$$$$ They also show that Maximum Likelihood training, the procedure that is routinely used to estimate hidden Markov models parameters from training data, will not necessarily improve the tagging accuracy.

We can surmise from the log-likelihood plot that the drop in accuracy is not due to the optimization being led astray, but probably rather due to the complex relationship between likelihood and task specific evaluation metrics in unsupervised learning (Merialdo, 1994). $$$$$ The Maximum Likelihood algorithm appears more complex at first glance, because it involves computing the sum of the probabilities of a large number of alignments.

Work on type-supervision goes back to (Merialdo, 1994), who introduced the still standard procedure of using a bigram Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained via Expectation Maximization. $$$$$ This is the problem of training a hidden Markov model (it is hidden because the sequence of tags is hidden).

(Merialdo, 1994) $$$$$ It is achieved using a dynamic programming scheme. where 0(W), is the tag assigned to word w, by the tagging procedure in the context of the sentence W. We call this procedure Maximum It is interesting to note that the most commonly used method is Viterbi tagging (see DeRose 1988; Church 1989) although it is not the optimal method for evaluation at word level.

Although useful under some circumstances, when a relatively large amount of labeled data is available, the procedure often degrades performance (e.g. Merialdo (1994)). $$$$$ 0

Merialdo (1994) reports an accuracy of 86.6% for an unsupervised word-based HMM,. $$$$$ In fact, it will generally degrade this accuracy, except when only a limited amount of hand-tagged text is available.
