We should emphasize that the features induced from the addressee's utterance are unique to this task and are hardly available in the related tasks that predicted the emotion of a reader of news articles (Lin and HsinYihn, 2008) or personal stories (Socher et al, 2011). $$$$$ 5 based on CKY-like beam search algorithms (Socher et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2011) but the performance is similar and the greedy version is much faster.

Unlike Socher et al (2011c) that utilize manually labeled texts to learn the meaning of phrase (or sentence) through compositionality, we focus on learning the meaning of word, namely word embedding, from massive distant-supervised tweets. $$$$$ These word vectors are then stacked into a word embedding matrix L E Rn√ó

Recursive Autoencoder (Socher et al, 2011c) has been proven effective in many sentiment analysis tasks by learning compositionality automatically. $$$$$ Recently, (Socher et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2011) introduced a max-margin framework based on recursive neural networks (RNNs) for labeled structure prediction.

To do this, we use two unsupervised recursive autoencoders (RAE) (Socher et al, 2011b), one for the source phrase and the other for the target phrase. $$$$$ We first describe neural word representations and then proceed to review a related recursive model based on autoencoders, introduce our recursive autoencoder (RAE) and describe how it can be modified to jointly learn phrase representations, phrase structure and sentiment distributions.
To do this, we use two unsupervised recursive autoencoders (RAE) (Socher et al, 2011b), one for the source phrase and the other for the target phrase. $$$$$ So far, the RAE was completely unsupervised and induced general representations that capture the semantics of multi-word phrases.In this section, we extend RAEs to a semi-supervised setting in order to predict a sentence- or phrase-level target distribution t.1 One of the main advantages of the RAE is that each node of the tree built by the RAE has associated with it a distributed vector representation (the parent vector p) which could also be seen as features describing that phrase.

By providing richer representations of meaning than what can be encompassed in a discrete representation, such approaches have successfully been applied to tasks such as sentiment analysis (Socher et al, 2011), topic classification (Klementiev et al, 2012) or word-word similarity (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008). $$$$$ Pang et al. (2002) were one of the first to experiment with sentiment classification.
