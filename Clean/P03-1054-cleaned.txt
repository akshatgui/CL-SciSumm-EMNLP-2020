We parsed each sentence using the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and used heuristics to identify cases where the main verb is transitive, where the subject is a nominalization (e.g. running), or whether the sentence is passive. $$$$$ The same sentence, parsed using only the baseline and is parsed correctly, because the in the incorrect parse ends with an very low marked nodes had no siblings with It was similar to solo benefit (0.01% worse), but provided far less marginal benefit on top of later features (none at all on top of our top models), and was One restricted place where external unary annotation was very useful, however, was at the preterminal level, where internal annotation was meaningless.

We parsed the documents into typed dependencies with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ It has been comprehensively demonstrated that lexical dependencies are useful in resolving major classes of sentence ambiguities, and a parser should make use of such information where possible.

To relieve the negative effect of SRL errors, we get the multiple SRL results by providing the SRL system with 3-best parse trees of Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), 1 best parse tree of Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004) and Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ The best has an 79.74, already a substantial improvement over the baseline.
