Therefore, there is nowadays a pressing need to adopt learning approaches to extend the coverage of the FrameNet lexicon by automatically acquiring new LUs, a task we call LU induction, as recently proposed at SemEval-2007 (Baker et al, 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

We also tested our models on a realistic gold-standard set of 24 unknown LUs extracted from the SemEval-2007 corpus (Baker et al., 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

Johansson and Nugues (2007) presented the best performing system at SemEval 2007 (Baker et al, 2007), and Das et al (2010) improved performance, and later set the current state of the art on this task (Das et al,2014). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

Previous shared tasks have shown that frame-semantic SRL of running text is a hard problem (Baker et al, 2007), partly due to the fact that running text is bound to contain many frames for which no or little annotated training data are available. $$$$$ 3.1 Training data.

LU induction has been integrated at SemEval-2007 as part of the Frame Semantic Structure Extraction shared task (Baker et al, 2007), where systems are requested to assign the correct frame to a given LU, even when the LU is not yet present in FrameNet. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

In our experiments, we use FrameNet 1.5, which contains a lexicon of 877 frames and 1,068 role labels, and 78 documents with multiple predicate argument annotations (a superset of the SemEval shared task dataset; Baker et al, 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

We will also use our measures in applications, to check their effectiveness in supporting various tasks, e.g. in mapping frames across Text and Hypothesis in RTE, in linking related frames in discourse, or in inducing frames for LU which are not in FrameNet (Baker et al, 2007). $$$$$ The evaluation measured precision and recall for frames and frame elements, with partial credit for incorrect but closely related frames.

They used the mapping in the Semeval-2007 task on frame-semantic structure extraction (Baker et al, 2007) in order to find target words in open text and assign frames.

Recent work on frame-semantic parsing in which sentences may contain multiple frames to be recognized along with their arguments has used the SemEval 07 data (Baker et al, 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

Domain-oriented semantic structures are valuable assets because their representation suits information needs in the domain; however, the extraction of such structures is difficult due to the large gap between the text and these structures. On the other hand, the extraction of linguistically oriented semantics from text has long been studied in computational linguistics, and has recently been formalized as Semantic Role Labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and semantic structure extraction (Baker et al, 2007) (Surdeanu et al, 2008). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

A variety of methods have been developed for semantic role labeling with reasonably good performance (F 1 measures in the low 80s on standard test collections for English; we refer the interested reader to the proceedings of the SemEval-2007 shared task (Baker et al, 2007) for an overview of the state-of-the-art). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 19

Considering how the performance of supervised systems degrades on out-of-domain data (Bakeret al, 2007), not to mention unseen events, semi supervised or unsupervised methods seem to offer the primary near-term hope for broad coverage semantic role labeling. $$$$$ The task of labeling frame-evoking words with ap propriate frames is similar to WSD, while the task of assigning frame elements is called Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), and has been the subject of several shared tasks at ACL and CoNLL.
