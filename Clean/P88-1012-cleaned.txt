Two main extensions from that work that we are making use of are: 1) proofs falling below a user defined cost threshold halt the search 2) a simple variable typing system reduces the number of axioms written and the size of the search space (Hobbs et al, 1988, pg 102). $$$$$ This has involved building a large knowledge base of commonsense and domain knowledge (see Hobbs et al., 1986), and developing procedures for using this knowledge for the interpretation of discourse.

A third approach, exemplified by Moldovan et al (2003) and Raina et al (2005), is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasi-logical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ This has involved building a large knowledge base of commonsense and domain knowledge (see Hobbs et al., 1986), and developing procedures for using this knowledge for the interpretation of discourse.

As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ Abductive inference is inference to the best explanation.
As shown in "Interpretation as Abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988), abductive inference is inference to the best explanation. $$$$$ We therefore need a scheme of abductive inference with three features.

While pursuing the path tracing enabling minimal explanation, now we are going to propose a connectability measure similar such as "weighted abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988). $$$$$ Interpretation As Abduction
While pursuing the path tracing enabling minimal explanation, now we are going to propose a connectability measure similar such as "weighted abduction" (Hobbs et al 1988). $$$$$ We want the most specific possible explanation.
