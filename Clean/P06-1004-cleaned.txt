Our model for disentanglement fits into the general class of graph partitioning algorithms (Roth and Yih, 2004) which have been used for a variety of tasks in NLP, including the related task of meeting segmentation (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006). $$$$$ We formalize segmentation as a graph-partitioning task that optimizes the normalized cut criterion.

In our problem, however, the solution is constrained by the linearity of segmentation on transcripts, similar to that in (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006). $$$$$ Fortunately, we can find an exact solution due to the linearity constraint on text segmentation.

Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) describe a dynamic programming algorithm to conduct topic segmentation for spoken documents. $$$$$ The time complexity of the dynamic programming algorithm is O(KN2), where K is the number of partitions and N is the number of nodes in the graph or sentences in the transcript.

Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) optimize a normalized minimum-cut criteria based on a variation of the cosine similarity between sentences. $$$$$ Minimum Cut Model For Spoken Lecture Segmentation
Malioutov and Barzilay (2006) optimize a normalized minimum-cut criteria based on a variation of the cosine similarity between sentences. $$$$$ Table 5 shows that the Minimum Cut algorithm consistently outperforms the similarity-based baseline on all the lecture datasets.

This is common practice for this task, as the desired number of segments may be determined by the user (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006). $$$$$ In contrast to previous approaches, the homogeneity of a segment is determined not only by the similarity of its words, but also by their relation to words in other segments of the text.
This is common practice for this task, as the desired number of segments may be determined by the user (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006). $$$$$ We intentionally did not provide the subjects with the target number of boundaries, since we wanted to see if the annotators would converge on a common segmentation granularity.

We use the evaluation source code provided by Malioutov and Barzilay (2006). $$$$$ In the formulation above we use sentences as our nodes.

In situations where the document boundaries are unavailable or when finer segmentation is desired, automatic techniques for document segmentation may be applied (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006). $$$$$ We have access both to manual transcriptions of these lectures and also output from an automatic speech recognition system.
