A current project at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Kulick et al 2004) is producing a corpus that follows many of these basic principles. $$$$$ In this project, the syntactic and semantic annotation is being done on a corpus which is also being annotated for entities, as described in Section 2.

For example, the BioText (Rosarioand Hearst, 2004) corpus has no specific annotation guideline and contains several inconsistencies, while PennBioIE (Kulick et al, 2004) is very specific to a particular sub-domain of diseases. $$$$$ We have been influenced in this by previous work in annotation for biomedical information extraction (Ohta et al., 2002; Gaizauskas et al., 2003).

The first dataset (PBIO) is based on the annotations of the PENNBIOIE corpus for biomedical entity extraction (Kulick et al, 2004). $$$$$ This is similar to other work in biomedical extraction projects (Hirschman et al., 2002).

In the biomedical domain, for example, several annotated corpora such as GENIA (Kim et al, 2003), PennBioIE (Kulick et al, 2004), and GENETAG (Tanabe et al, 2005) have been created and made publicly available, but the named entity categories annotated in these corpora are tailored to their specific needs and not always sufficient or suit able for text mining tasks that other researchers need to address. $$$$$ Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see (Hirschman et al., 2002)).

For the second adaptation task we were given a large collection of unlabeled data in the chemistry domain (Kulick et al 2004) as well as a test set of 5000 tokens (200 sentences) to parse (eng-lish_pchemtbtb_test.conll). $$$$$ Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see (Hirschman et al., 2002)).

Their corpus contains MEDLINE abstracts on the inhibition of the enzyme CYP450 (Kulick et al, 2004), specifically those abstracts that contain at least one overlapping and one discontinuous annotation. $$$$$ For example, the family of words based on inhibit occurs commonly in MEDLINE abstracts about CYP enzymes (as in the example in the introduction) in patterns like A inhibited B, A inhibited the catalytic activity of B, inhibition of B by A, etc.

Both the GENIA corpus (Kim et al, 2003) and the BioIE cytochrome P450 corpus (Kulick et al, 2004) come with named entity annotations that include a proportion of chemicals, and at least a few abstracts that are recognis able as chemistry abstracts. $$$$$ Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see (Hirschman et al., 2002)).

First, there is some evidence suggesting that standoff annotation and embedded XML are the two most highly preferred corpus annotation formats, and second, these for mats are employed by the two largest extant curated biomedical corpora, GENIA (Kim et al, 2001) and BioIE (Kulick et al, 2004). $$$$$ Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see (Hirschman et al., 2002)).

The development data was 200 sentences of labeled biomedical oncology text (BIO, the ONCO portion of the Penn Biomedical Treebank), as well as 200K unlabeled sentences (Kulick et al, 2004). $$$$$ Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see (Hirschman et al., 2002)).

Based on an analysis of the PennBioIE corpus (Kulick et al, 2004), detailed distributional results are provided on alternation patterns for several nominalizations with high frequency of occurrence in biomedical text, such as activation and treatment. $$$$$ We have been influenced in this by previous work in annotation for biomedical information extraction (Ohta et al., 2002; Gaizauskas et al., 2003).
