On the other hand, the thesaurus-based method of Yarowsky (1992) may suffer from loss of information (since it is semi-class-based) as well as data sparseness since H Classes used in Resnik (1992) are based on the WordNet taxonomy while classes of Brown et al (1992) and Pereira et al (1993) are derived from statistical data collected from corpora. $$$$$ We used these classes to construct an interpolated 3-gram class model using the same training text and held-out data as we used for the word-based language model we discussed above.

For all languages we use Brown clustering (Brown et al, 1992) to construct a log (C)+ C feature vector where the first log (C) elements indicate which mer gable cluster the word belongs to, and the last C elements indicate the cluster identity. $$$$$ Let and let The average mutual information remaining after V — k merges is We use the notation i+ j to represent the cluster obtained by merging Ck(i) and Ck(i)• If we know Ik.

We use the word clusters computed by Candito and Crabbe (2009) using Percy Liang's implementation of the Brown unsupervised clustering algorithm (Brown et al, 1992). $$$$$ To make even this suboptimal algorithm practical one must exercise a certain care in implementation.

One of the obvious syntagmas is words, and words are grouped into equivalence classes or clusters, thus reducing the model parameters of a statistical NLP system (Brown et al, 1992). $$$$$ We also discuss several statistical algorithms for assigning words to classes based on the frequency of their co-occurrence with other words.

The features were all derived from the publicly available clusters produced by running the Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al, 1992) over the BLLIP corpus with the Penn Treebank sentences excluded. $$$$$ The Brown corpus contains 1,014,312 words and has a perplexity of 244 with respect to our interpolated model.

Methods that use bigrams (Brown et al, 1992) or trigrams (Martin et al, 1998) cluster words considering as a word's context he one or two immediately adjacent words and employ as clustering criteria the minimal loss of average information and the perplexity improvement respectively. $$$$$ Initially, we assign each word to a distinct class and compute the average mutual information between adjacent classes.

Brown et al (1992) also proposed a window method introducing the concept of semantic stickiness of two words as the relatively frequent close occurrence between them (less than 500 words distance). $$$$$ Then, by examining the probability that two words will appear within a reasonable distance of one another, we use it to find classes that have some loose semantic coherence.

We find that the oldest system tested (Brown et al, 1992) produces the best prototypes, and that using these prototypes as input to Haghighi and Klein's system yields state of-the-art performance on WSJ and improvements on seven of the eight non-English corpora. $$$$$ To tackle this problem successfully, we must be able to estimate the probability with which any particular string of English words will be presented as input to the noisy channel.
