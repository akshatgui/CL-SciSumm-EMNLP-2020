For this, we create a parallel corpus consisting of n translation hypotheses and n copies of the corresponding source text, both lowercased and detokenized. We compute the word alignment with MGIZA++ (Gao and Vogel, 2008), based on the word alignment model from the primary corpus that we have previously saved to disk. After training a phrase table from the word aligned corpus with Moses, the lexical weights and translation probabilities are rescored, using the sufficient statistics (i.e. the word, phrase and word/phrase pair counts) of both the primary and the secondary corpus. $$$$$ The resulting word alignment is then used to extract phrase pairs and perhaps other information to be used in translation systems, such as block reordering models.
