We converted the POS system used in the Kyoto Text Corpus into ChaSen's POS system because we used ChaSen, a Japanese morphological analyzer, and CaboCha3 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), a dependency analyzer incorporating SVMs, as a state-of the art corpus-based Japanese dependency structure analyzer that prefers ChaSen's POS system to that of JUMAN. $$$$$ We used all 38,383 sentences of the Kyoto University text corpus Version 3.0.

Next, against the results of identifying compound functional expressions, we apply the method of dependency analysis based on the cascaded chunking model (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), which is simple and efficient because it parses a sentence deterministically only deciding whether the current bunsetsu segment modifies the one on its immediate right hand side. $$$$$ We propose a new method that is simple and efficient, since it parses a sentence deterministically only deciding whether the current segment modifies the segment on its immediate right hand side.

Unlike probabilistic dependency analysis models of Japanese, the cascaded chunking model of Kudoand Matsumoto (2002) does not require the probabilities of dependencies and parses a sentence deterministically. $$$$$ Japanese Dependency Analysis Using Cascaded Chunking

As a Japanese dependency analyzer based on the cascaded chunking model, we use the publicly available version of CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), which is trained with the manually parsed sentences of Kyoto text corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998), that are 38,400 sentences selected from the 1995 Mainichi newspaper text. $$$$$ This data set consists of the Kyoto University text corpus Version 2.0 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997).

(Since we used Isozaki's methods (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), the run-time complexity is not a problem.) Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) proposed an SVM based Dependency Analyzer for Japanese sentences. $$$$$ Dependency analysis has been recognized as a basic process in Japanese sentence analysis, and a number of studies have been proposed.

Japanese dependency parsers such as Cabocha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) can extract Bps and their dependencies with about 90% accuracy. $$$$$ Dependency accuracy is the percentage of correct dependencies out of all dependency relations.
