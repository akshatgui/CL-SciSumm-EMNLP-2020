Our work is related to previous work on domain independent unsupervised relation extraction, in particular Sekine (2006), Shinyama and Sekine (2006) and Banko et al (2007). $$$$$ There are many existing works on obtaining extraction patterns for pre-defined relations (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Sudo et al., 2003).

Shinyama and Sekine (2006) apply NER, coreference resolution and parsing to a corpus of newspaper articles to extract two-place relations between NEs. $$$$$ Then we apply cross-document coreference resolution to connect entities of different articles within a basic cluster.
Shinyama and Sekine (2006) apply NER, coreference resolution and parsing to a corpus of newspaper articles to extract two-place relations between NEs. $$$$$ In parallel with parsing and GLARFing, we also apply NE tagging and coreference resolution for each article in a basic cluster.

Like Sekine (2006) and Shinyama and Sekine (2006), we concentrate on relations involving NEs, the assumption being that these relations are the potentially interesting ones. $$$$$ To obtain such relations, we need to choose different entities from the articles.
Like Sekine (2006) and Shinyama and Sekine (2006), we concentrate on relations involving NEs, the assumption being that these relations are the potentially interesting ones. $$$$$ In addition, we use the frequency of each basic pattern to compute the similarity of relations, since basic patterns like “say” or “have” appear in almost every article and it is dangerous to rely on such expressions.

Inference rules are an important building block of many semantic applications, such as Question Answering (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) and Information Extraction (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006). $$$$$ Several existing works have tried to extract a certain type of relation by manually choosing different pairs of entities (Brin, 1998; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

An alternative paradigm, Open IE, pioneered by the TextRunner system (Banko et al., 2007) and the "preemptive IE" in (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), aims to handle an unbounded number of relations and run quickly enough to process Webscale corpora. $$$$$ There are many existing works on obtaining extraction patterns for pre-defined relations (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Sudo et al., 2003).

Shinyama and Sekine proposed the "preemptive IE" framework to avoid relation-specificity (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006). $$$$$ In this paper we proposed Preemptive Information Extraction as a new direction of IE research.

Our work focuses on a recent line of exploratory work in the direction of Unrestricted Relation Discovery which is defined as: the automatic identification of different relations in text without specifying a relation or set of relations in advance (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006). $$$$$ Preemptive Information Extraction Using Unrestricted Relation Discovery
Our work focuses on a recent line of exploratory work in the direction of Unrestricted Relation Discovery which is defined as: the automatic identification of different relations in text without specifying a relation or set of relations in advance (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006). $$$$$ In Unrestricted Relation Discovery, the discovery process (i.e. creating new tables) can be formulated as a clustering task.

Shinyama and Sekine (2006) developed an approach to preemptively discover relations in a corpus and present them as tables with all the entity pairs in the table having the same relations between them. $$$$$ Unrestricted Relation Discovery is a technique to automatically discover such relations that repeatedly appear in a corpus and present them as a table, with absolutely no human intervention.

A paradigm related to Open IE is Preemptive IE (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006). $$$$$ Suppose that there are two articles A and B, and both report hurricane-related news.

However, most algorithms (Hasegawa et al 2004, Shinyama and Sekine, 2006, Chen et. al, 2005) rely on tagging predefined types of entities as relation arguments, and thus are not well-suited for the open domain. $$$$$ There are many existing works on obtaining extraction patterns for pre-defined relations (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Sudo et al., 2003).

Preemptive IE (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) is a paradigm related to Open IE that first groups documents based on pairwise vector clustering, then applies additional clustering to group entities based on document clusters. $$$$$ To alleviate this problem, we put an additional restriction on clustering.
