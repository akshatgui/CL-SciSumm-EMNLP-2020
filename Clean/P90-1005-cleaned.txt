 $$$$$ (5) vl NP2 PP3 PP4 PPs First, we consider a &quot;core&quot; grammar that contains purely syntactic rules only.
 $$$$$ The parser treats this information as another set of unary constraints and applies it to the constraint network.

An architecture which fulfills this requirement is Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar, which was based on a model originally proposed by Maruyama (1990) and later extended with weights (Schroeder, 2002). $$$$$ Although there is no context-free grammar that generates Lww, the grammar Gww =< E, L, R, C

Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ The value 0 indicates that this particular combination of role values violates the binary constraints.
Originally, the constraints were comprised of a set of hand-written rules specifying which role values (unary constraints) and pairs of role values (binary constraints) were grammatical (Maruyama, 1990). $$$$$ Grammar rules are constraints on word-to-word modifications, and parsing is done by adding the constraints to a data structure called a constraint network.

Using constraint satisfaction techniques for natural language parsing was introduced first in (Maruyama, 1990) by defining a constraint dependency grammar (CDG) that maps nicely on the notion of a CSP. $$$$$ Although there is no context-free grammar that generates Lww, the grammar Gww =< E, L, R, C
