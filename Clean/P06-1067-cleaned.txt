Lexicalized distortion models predict the jump from the last translated word to the next one, with a class for each possible jump length (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006), or bin of lengths (Green et al, 2010). $$$$$ Second, their models consider only the direction (i.e., orientation) and not the relative jump.
Lexicalized distortion models predict the jump from the last translated word to the next one, with a class for each possible jump length (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006), or bin of lengths (Green et al, 2010). $$$$$ Any aligner such as (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999) or (Vogel et al., 1996) can be used to obtain word alignments.

Demonstrating the inadequacy of such approaches, Al-Onaizan and Papineni (2006) showed that even given the words in the reference translation, and their alignment to the source words, a decoder of this sort charged with merely rearranging them into the correct target-language order could achieve a BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) of at best 69% and that only when restricted to keep most words very close to their source positions. $$$$$ This new model leads to significant improvements in MT quality as measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

Since we are using the distortion model in (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006) the entire last source phrase interval needs to be stored. $$$$$ We will also show how to generalize this word distortion model to a phrase-based model.
Since we are using the distortion model in (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006) the entire last source phrase interval needs to be stored. $$$$$ So, when translating into English, one needs to move the verb after the subject, which is often a long compounded phrase.

As mentioned by (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006), it can be problematic that these deterministic choices are beyond the scope of optimization and cannot be undone by the decoder. $$$$$ Hence, reordering is better handled during the search algorithm and as part of the optimization function.

As pointed out in (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006), these strategies make hard decisions in reordering which cannot be undone during decoding. $$$$$ There is a fundamental difference between decoding for machine translation and decoding for speech recognition.

We then trained the lexicalized reordering model that produced distortion costs based on the number of words that are skipped on the target side, in a manner similar to (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006). $$$$$ The inbound and pair distortion costs (i..e, Ci(p, n, m, a) and Cp(p, n, m, a)) can be defined in a similar fashion.

This assumption is realistic: while truly parallel data (humanly created) might be in short supply or harder to acquire, adapting statistical machine translation (SMT) systems from one language-pair to another is not as challenging as it used to be (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006). $$$$$ Distortion Models For Statistical Machine Translation
