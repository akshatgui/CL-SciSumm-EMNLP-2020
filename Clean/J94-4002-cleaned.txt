Lappin and Leass (1994) extracted rules from the output of the English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord, 1993). $$$$$ RAP applies to the syntactic structures of McCord's (1990, 1993, in press) Slot Grammar parser, and like the parser, it is implemented in Prolog.

In the heuristic salience-based algorithm for pronoun resolution, Lappin and Leass (1994) introduce a procedure for identifying anaphorically linked NP as a cluster for which a global salience value is computed as the sum of the salience values of its elements. $$$$$ Deactivating the equivalence class mechanism also led to a significant deterioration in RAP's performance; in this variant (VII), only the salience factors applying to a particular NP contribute to its salience weight, without any contribution from other anaphorically linked NPs.
