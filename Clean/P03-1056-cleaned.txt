To run the DE classifiers, we use the Stanford Chinese parser (Levy and Manning, 2003) to parse the Chinese side of the MT training data, the devset and test set. $$$$$ Is It Harder To Parse Chinese Or The Chinese Treebank?
To run the DE classifiers, we use the Stanford Chinese parser (Levy and Manning, 2003) to parse the Chinese side of the MT training data, the devset and test set. $$$$$ To test the impact of Chinese Treebank N/V tagging practices, we tried training the parser with NN and VV training tags merged.

Levy and Manning (2003) used a factored model that combines an unlexicalized PCFG model with a dependency model. $$$$$ In adapting this parsing model to Chinese, we have retained unchanged the dependency model developed for English; the model backs off to tags, and backoff parameters remain the same.3 In all cases, test input to the parser was segmented but untagged.4 Our focus in parser development has been to refine the PCFG model via stepwise refinements informed by major observed ambiguity classes.

While it is uncommon to offer an error analysis for probabilistic parsing, Levy and Manning (2003) argue that a careful error classification can reveal possible improvements. $$$$$ Table 3 gives a breakdown of the major error types found; Figure 4 gives examples of unfamiliar major error types.5 In the next section we describe each major error type, analyze its causes, and suggest simple PCFG enhancements that can be used to address it.

Verb mistagging is also a problem for other languages $$$$$ We briefly explain here why N/V ambiguity is a hard problem in Chinese.

See Levy and Manning (2003) for a similar discussion of Chinese and the Penn Chinese Treebank. $$$$$ We take advantage of the recently released Penn Chinese Treebank (version 2.0, abbreviated here as CTB; (Xue et al., 2002)) to address these questions for Chinese, a language with less morphology and more mixed headedness than English.

Noun/verb mis-taggings are a frequent error case for PCFG parsing on PCTB data, compounded in Chinese by the lack of function words and morphology (Levy and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ First, Chinese makes less use of function words and morphology than English

It should be noted that it is straightforward to simultaneously do POS tagging and constituent parsing, as POS tags can be regarded as non-terminals in the constituent structure (Levy and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ Parsing in this model involves combining two independent parses

Levy and Manning (2003) established that properties of Chinese such as noun/verb ambiguity contribute to the difficulty of Chinese parsing. $$$$$ Significantly, this means that attachment ambiguity among a verb's complements, a major source of parsing ambiguity in English, is rare in Chinese.

We parsed the Chinese text using the Stanford parser (Levy and Manning, 2003) and the English text using TurboParser (Martins et al, 2009). $$$$$ Corpusbased statistical parsing is a leading technique to deal with this extreme ambiguity; the vast bulk of work in this field has been done in English, using the Wall Street Journal section of the English Penn Treebank (ETB).

As pointed out in (Levyand Manning, 2003), there are many linguistic differences between Chinese and English, as well as structural differences between their corresponding tree banks, and some of these make it a harder task to parse Chinese. $$$$$ Is It Harder To Parse Chinese Or The Chinese Treebank?

First of all, we adopt the head finding rules for Chinese used in (Levy and Manning, 2003), and this affects sieve 4, 6 and 7 which are all take advantage of the head words. $$$$$ We address this error by taking advantage of the CTB's principled VP annotation practices, marking adjunction, complementation, and coordination VP levels, which builds the flat adjunction constraint back into the structure of the head daughter.
