Hence, if we were given the perfect knowledge of the possible syntactic frames, verbs can be classified into the correct classes almost perfectly (Dorr and Jones, 1996). $$$$$ So although the signature for the Change of State class has 13 frames, the verb break has 39 frames from the other classes it appears in.

Dorr and Jones (1996) showed that perfect knowledge of the allowable syntactic frames for a verb allows 98% accuracy in type assignment to Levin classes. $$$$$ So although the signature for the Change of State class has 13 frames, the verb break has 39 frames from the other classes it appears in.
Dorr and Jones (1996) showed that perfect knowledge of the allowable syntactic frames for a verb allows 98% accuracy in type assignment to Levin classes. $$$$$ i.e., 82% accuracy.

 $$$$$ But the inten- sions of these functions are matters of significant he- oretical investigation, and although much has been ac- complished in this ~rea, the question of mapping syntax to semantics and vice versa is an open research topic.

Verb classifications have, in fact, been used to support many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as language generation, machine translation (Dorr, 1997), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996) and sub categorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002). $$$$$ Machine Translation,9.
