Recently (Riezler et al, 2007) used statistical machine translation for query expansion and took a step towards bridging the lexical gap between questions and answers. $$$$$ We present an approach to query expansion in answer retrieval that uses Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to bridge the lexical gap between questions and answers.

Riezler et al (2007) define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem. $$$$$ In this paper we will concentrate on the task of answer retrieval from FAQ pages, i.e., an IR problem where user queries are matched against documents consisting of question-answer pairs found in FAQ pages.
Riezler et al (2007) define the problem of answer retrieval from FAQ and social Q/A websites as a query expansion problem. $$$$$ A similar picture emerges for query expansion in QA: Mixed results have been reported for wordby-word expansion based on WordNet (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001).

With the exception of the query expansion approaches (Riezler et al, 2007), all works discussed here use some form of noisy-channel model (translation model and target language model) but do not perform the decoding part of the SMT process to generate translations, nor use the rich set of features of a full SMT. $$$$$ Our second query expansion model is based on the use of SMT technology for full-sentence paraphrasing.

(2001) neglect to use a language model to aid disambiguation of translation choices, and Duboue and Chu-Carroll (2006) use SMT as black box altogether.

Furthermore, we plan to include the Level 1 translations into the candidate answer generation module in order to do query expansion in the style of Riezler et al (2007). $$$$$ For example, syntactic information has been deployed to reformulate questions (Hermjakob et al., 2002) or to replace questions by syntactically similar ones (Lin and Pantel, 2001); lexical ontologies such as Wordnet1 have been used to find synonyms for question words (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation (SMT) models trained on question-answer pairs have been used to rank candidate answers according to their translation probabilities (Berger et al., 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).

Similar work has also been performed in the area of query expansion using training data consisting of FAQ pages (Riezler et al, 2007) or queries and clicked snippets from query logs (Riezler et al, 2008). $$$$$ For example, syntactic information has been deployed to reformulate questions (Hermjakob et al., 2002) or to replace questions by syntactically similar ones (Lin and Pantel, 2001); lexical ontologies such as Wordnet1 have been used to find synonyms for question words (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation (SMT) models trained on question-answer pairs have been used to rank candidate answers according to their translation probabilities (Berger et al., 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).

(Riezler et al, 2007) adopted an SMT-based method to query expansion in answer retrieval. $$$$$ A similar picture emerges for query expansion in QA: Mixed results have been reported for wordby-word expansion based on WordNet (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001).
(Riezler et al, 2007) adopted an SMT-based method to query expansion in answer retrieval. $$$$$ We presented two techniques for query expansion in answer retrieval that are based on SMT technology.

Our work is also related to that of Riezler et al (2007) where SMT-based query expansion methods are used on data from FAQ pages. $$$$$ We present two approaches to SMT-based query expansion, both of which are implemented in the framework of phrase-based SMT (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003).

Riezler et al (2007) demonstrate the advantages of translation-based approach to answer retrieval by utilizing a more complex translation model also trained from a large amount of data extracted from FAQs on the Web. $$$$$ For example, syntactic information has been deployed to reformulate questions (Hermjakob et al., 2002) or to replace questions by syntactically similar ones (Lin and Pantel, 2001); lexical ontologies such as Wordnet1 have been used to find synonyms for question words (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation (SMT) models trained on question-answer pairs have been used to rank candidate answers according to their translation probabilities (Berger et al., 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).

Besides, Riezler et al (2007) and Zhou et al (2011) proposed the phrase-based translation models for question and answer retrieval. $$$$$ For example, syntactic information has been deployed to reformulate questions (Hermjakob et al., 2002) or to replace questions by syntactically similar ones (Lin and Pantel, 2001); lexical ontologies such as Wordnet1 have been used to find synonyms for question words (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation (SMT) models trained on question-answer pairs have been used to rank candidate answers according to their translation probabilities (Berger et al., 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).
