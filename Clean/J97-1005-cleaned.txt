Passonneau and Litman (1997) describe an experiment where seven untrained annotators were asked to find discourse segments in a corpus of transcribed narratives about a movie. $$$$$ Chafe recorded and transcribed subjects who had been asked to view the same movie and describe it to a second person.
Passonneau and Litman (1997) describe an experiment where seven untrained annotators were asked to find discourse segments in a corpus of transcribed narratives about a movie. $$$$$ Similarly, although our spoken corpus was manually transcribed, this could have been automated using speech recognition (although this would introduce further sources of error).

We turned the segmentation task into a classification task by using boundaries between dialogue acts as one class and non-boundaries a the other (see Passonneau and Litman (1997) for a similar practice). $$$$$ The segmentation task reported here is not properly a classification task, in that we do not presume that there is a given set of segment boundaries that subjects are likely to identify.

By using multiple markers and machine learning methods, topic segmentation algorithms may be developed using this second approach that have a higher accuracy than methods using a single marker alone (Passonneau and Litman, 1997). $$$$$ We then develop a second set using two methods

Even annotating linear segmentation is challenging, particularly in the vicinity of segment boundaries (PassonneauandLitman, 1997). $$$$$ First, subjects were asked to perform a linear rather than a hierarchical segmentation, where a linear segmentation simply consists of dividing a narrative into sequential units.
Even annotating linear segmentation is challenging, particularly in the vicinity of segment boundaries (PassonneauandLitman, 1997). $$$$$ On a relatively unconstrained linear segmentation task, the number of times different naive subjects identify the same segment boundaries in a given narrative transcript is extremely significant.

These referential and lexical features build on the work of Passonneau and Litman (1997), who use them in discourse segmentation. $$$$$ Full details are presented in Passonneau and Litman (1996).
These referential and lexical features build on the work of Passonneau and Litman (1997), who use them in discourse segmentation. $$$$$ In related work, we have tested the hypothesis that the use of a discourse focus structure based on the Pear segmentation data improves performance of a generation algorithm, thus providing a quantitative measure of the utility of the segmentation data (Passonneau 1996).

First, if non-canonicals are indicators of attentional stack pops, they should be more likely at segment boundaries; hence, we expect an increased presence of cue words (Passonneau and Litman, 1997) on non-canonicals compared to canonicals. $$$$$ These and other studies (e.g., Hirschberg and Litman [1993]) also found it useful to distinguish between sentence-final and non-sentence-final intonational contours.

In this sense, we are performing low-level discourse segmentation, as opposed to segmenting text into chunks or topics (e.g., Passonneau and Litman (1997)). $$$$$ Full details are presented in Passonneau and Litman (1996).
In this sense, we are performing low-level discourse segmentation, as opposed to segmenting text into chunks or topics (e.g., Passonneau and Litman (1997)). $$$$$ The segmentation algorithms presented in Section 4.2 are evaluated by quantifying their performance in segmenting a test set of 10 narratives from our corpus.

Passonneau and Litman (1997) found that pause length correlates with discourse segment boundaries. $$$$$ Full details are presented in Passonneau and Litman (1996).
Passonneau and Litman (1997) found that pause length correlates with discourse segment boundaries. $$$$$ We discuss this second issue at length in Passonneau and Litman (1996).

This makes it different from others using surface features like (Passonneau and Litman, 1997). $$$$$ Full details are presented in Passonneau and Litman (1996).
This makes it different from others using surface features like (Passonneau and Litman, 1997). $$$$$ Finally, differences in segmentation may reflect different interpretations of the discourse, as we pointed out in Passonneau and Litman (1996), based on observations of our subjects' segment descriptions.

Automatic discourse segmentation, as shallow annotation of discourse structure, also provides a testing grounds for linguistic theories of discourse (Passonneau and Litman, 1997) and provides a natural unit of measure in linguistic corpora (Biber et al, 2004). $$$$$ The need to model the relation between discourse structure and linguistic features of utterances is almost universally acknowledged in the literature on discourse.

Human annotators demonstrate frequent disagreement about the number of segments and exactly where the transitions between segments occur, while still demonstrating statistically significant agreement (Passonneau and Litman, 1997). $$$$$ Our results demonstrate an extremely significant pattern of agreement on segment boundaries.
Human annotators demonstrate frequent disagreement about the number of segments and exactly where the transitions between segments occur, while still demonstrating statistically significant agreement (Passonneau and Litman, 1997). $$$$$ After identifying segments, and core and contributor relations within segments, Moser and Moore (1995) investigate whether cue words occur, where they occur, and what word occurs.
