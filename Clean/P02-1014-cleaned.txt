See Ng and Cardie (2002) for a detailed description of the features. $$$$$ We use the C4.5 decision tree induction system (Quinlan, 1993) to train a classifier that, given a description of two NPs in a document, NP✂ and NP✄ , decides whether or not they are coreferent.

We now show that the search problem in (2) can equivalently be solved by the more intuitive best first decoder (Ng and Cardie, 2002), rather than using the CLE decoder. $$$$$ Rather than a right-to-left search from each anaphoric NP for the first coreferent NP, we hypothesized that a right-to-left search for a highly likely antecedent might offer more precise, if not generally better coreference chains.

The use of latent antecedents goes back to the work of Yu and Joachims (2009), although the idea of determining meaningful antecedents for mentions can be tracedback to Ng and Cardie (2002) who used a rule based approach. $$$$$ This paper presents an NP coreference system that investigates two types of extensions to the Soon et al. corpus-based approach.

One way to utilize the semantic compatibility is to take it as a feature under the single-candidate learning model as employed by Ng and Cardie (2002). $$$$$ First, we find that performance drops significantly when using the full feature set, even though the learning algorithms investigated have built-in feature selection mechanisms.

We test on the ANC Test set (1291 instances) also used in Bergsma (2005) (highest resolution accuracy reported: 73.3%), the anaphora labelled portion of AQUAINT used in Cherry and Bergsma (2005) (1078 instances, highest accuracy: 71.4%), and the anaphoric pronoun subset of the MUC7 (1997) coreference evaluation formal test set (169 instances, highest precision of 62.1 reported on all pronouns in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)). $$$$$ The MUC-6 corpus produces a training set of 26455 instances (5.4% positive) from 4381 NPs and a test set of 28443 instances (5.2% positive) from 4565 NPs.

Ng and Cardie (2002) expanded the feature set of Soon et al (2001) from 12 to 53 features. $$$$$ Second, in an attempt to understand whether incorporating additional knowledge can improve the performance of a corpus-based coreference resolution system, we expand the Soon et al. feature set from 12 features to an arguably deeper set of 53.

Ng and Cardie (2002) split this feature into several primitive features, depending on the type of noun phrases. $$$$$ Noun phrase coreference resolution refers to the problem of determining which noun phrases (NPs) refer to each real-world entity mentioned in a document.
Ng and Cardie (2002) split this feature into several primitive features, depending on the type of noun phrases. $$$$$ We hypothesized, however, that splitting this feature into several primitive features, depending on the type of NP, might give the learning algorithm additional flexibility in creating coreference rules.

Barzilay and Lapata (2008) use the coreference system of Ng and Cardie (2002) to obtain coreference annotations. $$$$$ Although the use of similar knowledge sources has been explored in the context of both pronoun resolution (e.g.
Barzilay and Lapata (2008) use the coreference system of Ng and Cardie (2002) to obtain coreference annotations. $$$$$ As a result, we modify the coreference clustering algorithm to select as the antecedent of NP✄ the NP with the highest coreference likelihood value from among preceding NPs with coreference class values above 0.5.

Although there is empirical evidence (e.g. Ng and Cardie 2002a, 2004) that coreference resolution might be further improved with proper anaphoricity information, its contribution is still somewhat disappointing and lacks systematic evaluation. $$$$$ We evaluate the Duplicated Soon Baseline system using the standard MUC-6 (1995) and MUC7 (1998) coreference corpora, training the coreference classifier on the 30 “dry run” texts, and applying the coreference resolution algorithm on the 20–30 “formal evaluation” texts.
Although there is empirical evidence (e.g. Ng and Cardie 2002a, 2004) that coreference resolution might be further improved with proper anaphoricity information, its contribution is still somewhat disappointing and lacks systematic evaluation. $$$$$ For instance, the CONTAINS PN feature effectively disallows coreference between NPs that contain distinct proper names but are not themselves proper names (e.g.

Ng and Cardie (2002a) employed various domain-independent features in identifying anaphoric NPs and showed how such information can be incorporated into a coreference resolution system. $$$$$ Because sources of linguistic information in a learning-based system are represented as features, we can, in contrast, incorporate them selectively rather than as universal hard constraints.
