Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ With few exceptions, they rely on intuitive analyses of topic structure; operational definitions of discourse-level properties (e.g., interpreting paragraph breaks as discourse segment boundaries); or 'theory-neutral' discourse segmentations, where subjects are given instructions to simply mark changes in topic.
Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ An intention-based theory of discourse was used in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992) to identify intonational correlates of discourse structure in news stories read by a professional speaker.

Speech was found to improve inter-annotator agreement in discourse segmentation of monologues (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). $$$$$ A Prosodic Analysis Of Discourse Segments In Direction-Giving Monologues
Speech was found to improve inter-annotator agreement in discourse segmentation of monologues (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996). $$$$$ Flammia has proposed a method for generalizing the use of the K coefficient for hierarchical segmentation that gives an upper-bound estimate on inter-labeler agreement.5 We applied this metric to our segmentation data, calculating weighted averages for pairwise n scores averaged for each task.

Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ An intention-based theory of discourse was used in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992) to identify intonational correlates of discourse structure in news stories read by a professional speaker.
Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ We have demonstrated that a theory-based method for discourse analysis can provide reliable segmentations of spontaneous as well as read speech.

A conservative way to combine segmentationsinto a gold standard is the Consensus (CNS) (or raw agreement) approach (Hir chberg and Nakatani, 1996). $$$$$ Table 1 shows that group S produced significantly more consensus boundaries for both read (p<.001, x=58.8, df=1) and spontaneous (p<.001, x=55.4, df=1) speech than did 3Use of consensus labels is a conservative measure of labeler agreement.

Discourse structure has been successfully used in non-interactive settings (e.g. understanding specific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), natural language generation (Hovy, 1993), essay scoring (Higgins et al, 2004) as well as in interactive settings (e.g. predictive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et al., 2001), generation/interpretation of anaphoric expressions (Allen et al, 2001), performance modeling (Rotaru and Litman, 2006)). $$$$$ It has long been assumed in computational linguistics that discourse structure plays an important role in Natural Language Understanding tasks such as identifying speaker intentions and resolving anaphoric reference.

(1980) found that subjects typically started new topics relatively high in their pitch range and finished topics by compressing their range.

We report results on the Boston University (BU) Radio Speech Corpus (Ostendorf et al, 1995) and Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), two publicly available speech corpora with manual ToBI annotations intended for experiments in automatic prosody labeling. $$$$$ Swerts and Ostendorf (1995), however, report negative rate results.

In spontaneous monologue, Butterworth (1972) found that the beginning of a discourse segment exhibited slower speaking rate; Swerts (1995), and Passonneau and Litman (1997) found that pause length correlates with discourse segment boundaries; Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) found that the beginning of a discourse segment correlates with higher pitch. $$$$$ And speaking rate has been found to correlate with structural variation; in several studies (Lehiste, 1980; Brubaker, 1972; Butterworth, 1975) segment-initial utterances exhibited slower rates, and segment-final, faster rates.
