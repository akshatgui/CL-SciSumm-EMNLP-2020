(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) had shown the use of dependency in Prepositional Phrase disambiguation, and the experimental results reported in (Hock en maier, 2003) demonstrate that a language model which encodes a rich notion of predicate argument structure (e.g. including long-range relations arising through coordination) can significantly improve the parsing performances. $$$$$ Thus, we generated a table with entries including those shown in Table 1.

Selectional preference has been shown to be useful for, e.g., resolving ambiguous attachments (Hindle and Rooth, 1991), word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ Of these, 586 are noun attachments and 294 verb attachments.

But it is harder because it does not provide the predictor with all the information needed to solve many doubtful cases; (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) found that human arbiters consistently reach a higher agreement when they are given the entire sentence rather than just the four words concerned. $$$$$ The ambiguity in (9) arises from the fact that if someone is one of the joint agents in the signing of an agreement, that person is likely to be a party to the agreement.

(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) first proposed solving the prepositional attachment task with the help of statistical information, and also defined the prevalent formulation as a binary decision problem with three words involved. $$$$$ In many cases, the decision was difficult.
