Brown et al (1991) proposed a WSD algorithm to disambiguate English translations of French target words based on the single most informative context feature. $$$$$ To understand their algorithm, first imagine that w is a French word and that English words which are possible translations of w have been divided into two classes.

The idea of obtaining linguistic information about a text in one language by exploiting parallel or comparable texts in another language has been explored in the field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) since the early 90's, the most representative works being (Brown et al, 1991), (Gale et al, 1992), and (Dagan and Itai, 1994). $$$$$ Following Brown et al.

As a somewhat radical alternative to taxonomical relationships, other ways of measuring semantic similarity based on distributional evidence have been put forward in the literature (see, among others, Brown et al 1991, Gale et al 1992, Pereira and Tishby 1992), which emphasise the role played by context in this game. $$$$$ Following Brown et al.

 $$$$$ Let p(e, f) be the probability that a connection chosen at random from this set will connect the English word e to the French word f. Because each French word gives rise to exactly one connection, the right marginal of this distribution is identical to the distribution of French words in these sentences.
 $$$$$ We judged 45 of the resultant translations as acceptable as compared with 37 acceptable translations produced by the same system running without sense-disambiguation questions.

The reduction of input data requirements offers a significant advantage compared with methods such as those presented in Brown et al (1991), Gale et al (1992), Yarowsky (1995), and Karol and Edelman (1996) where strong reliance on statistical techniques for the calculation of word and context similarity commands large source corpora. $$$$$ An alluring aspect of the statistical approach to machine translation rejuvenated by Brown et al.
