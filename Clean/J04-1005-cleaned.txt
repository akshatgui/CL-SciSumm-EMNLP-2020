We follow the notation of Di Eugenio and Glass (2004). $$$$$ In fact, Carletta et al. (1997) use words of caution against adopting Krippendorff’s suggestion as a standard; the first author has also raised the issue of how to assess K values in Di Eugenio (2000).

To assess this classification task we also used the kappa statistics which yielded KCo=0.922 (following (Eugenio and Glass, 2004) we report Kas KCo, indicating that we calculate K a la Cohen (Cohen, 1960). $$$$$ 1960.

Feinstein and Cicchetti (1990), followed by Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) proved that Kappa is subject to the effect of prevalence and that different marginal distributions can lead to very different Kappa values for the same observed agreement. $$$$$ 1990.

But Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) have found that this interpretation does not hold true for all tasks. $$$$$ We will conclude by suggesting that κCo is a better choice than κS&C in those studies in which the assumption of equal distributions underlying κS&C does not hold

Ever since its introduction in general (Cohen, 1960) and in computational linguistics (Carletta, 1996), many researchers have pointed out that there are quite some problems in using κ (e.g. (Di Eugenio and Glass, 2004)), one of which is the discrepancy between p0 and κ for skewed class distribution. $$$$$ 1960.
