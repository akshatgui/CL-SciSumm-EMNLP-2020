As we said at the outset, we don't necessarily believe HunPos to be in any way better than TnT, and certainly the main ideas have been pioneered by DeRose (1988), Church (1988), and others long before this generation of HMM work. $$$$$ Graphing the logarithms Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 1, Winter 1988 33 Steven J.

We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988) or DeRose (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to/in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to/to. $$$$$ The CLAWS documentation describes SUMSUCCPROBS as &quot;the total value of all relationships between the tags associated with this word and the tags associated with the next word.

Kallgren (1996) gives a more covering description of how XPOST is used on the Swedish material and also sketches the major differences between this algorithm and some others used for tagging, such as PARTS (Church 1988) and VOLSUNGA (DeRose 1988). $$$$$ The major differences are outlined below.

The latter approach was pioneered by Stolz et al (1965) and Bahl and Mercer (1976), and became widely known through the work of e.g. Church (1988) and DeRose (1988). $$$$$ How often the fallback is employed is not known, nor is it known what effect its use has on overall accuracy.
