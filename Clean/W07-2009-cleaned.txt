Our systems consistently perform better when a mode exists, which makes sense because those are instances in which the annotators are in agreement (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ We want to emphasise test items with better agreement.
Our systems consistently perform better when a mode exists, which makes sense because those are instances in which the annotators are in agreement (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ With 10 guesses there is a better chance that the systems find the responses of these 5 annotators.

Our evaluation framework is inspired by the lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), where a system attempts to generate a word (or a set of words) to replace a target word, such that the meaning of the sentence is preserved. $$$$$ In the task, annotators and systems find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context.
Our evaluation framework is inspired by the lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), where a system attempts to generate a word (or a set of words) to replace a target word, such that the meaning of the sentence is preserved. $$$$$ For mw detection and identification we used WordNet to detect if a multiword in WordNet which includes the target word occurs within a window of 2 words before and 2 words after the target word.

The first one, the LEXSUB-PARA dataset, is a small subset of the Lexical Substitution corpus (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) that was specifically created for this task. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

While Dinu and Lapata (Dinu and Lapata, 2010b) did show improvement over context insensitive DIRT, this result was obtained on the verbs of the Lexical Substitution Task in SemEval (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), which was manually created with a bias for context-sensitive substitutions. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

Then we will also be able to evaluate our model on the Lexical Substitution Task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), which has been commonly used in recent years as a benchmark for context-sensitive lexical similarity models. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

Recently, McCarthy and Navigli (2007) proposed the English Lexical Substitution task (hereafter referred to as LEXSUB) under the auspices of SemEval-2007. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

Within the scope of our paper, rule application is handled similarly to Lexical Substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), considering the contextual relationship between the text and the rule. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

SWAT-E is the best system for out often, as several of the items that were emphasized through duplication were also correct. The results are much higher than for LEXSUB (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ best measures This requires the best file produced by the system which gives as many guesses as the system believes are fitting, but where the credit for each correct guess is divided by the number of guesses.

The past work which is most similar to ours is derived from the lexical substitution track of SemEval 2007 (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

In particular, this technique ranks a given list of synonyms according to a similarity metric based on the occurrences in the Web 1T 5-gram corpus, which specify n-grams frequencies in a large Web sample. This technique achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the English Lexical Substitution task at SemEval 2007 (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

To evaluate the system's ability to come up with suitable substitutes from scratch, we use the measures designed to evaluate systems that took part in the original English lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

We evaluate our model on a paraphrase ranking task on a subset of the SemEval 2007 lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) data, and compare it to a random baseline and E&P's state of the art model. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

Instead, we automatically extract confusable candidates from a parallel corpus. Synonym extraction (Wu and Zhou, 2003), lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) and paraphrasing (Madnani and Dorr, 2010) are related to collocation correction in the sense that they try to find semantically equivalent words or phrases. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

Our first experiment is carried out on the SemEval 2007 lexical substitution task dataset (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

To evaluate the performance of our model, we use various subsets of the SemEval 2007 lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) dataset. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10

We use it because we want to compare our model with E&P. P10 measures the percentage of gold-standard paraphrases in the top-ten list of paraphrases as ranked by the system, and can be defined as follows (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007). $$$$$ We want to emphasise test items with better agreement.

We explore this suggestion, implementing a lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli,2007) approach to dialogue generation with sentiment, using the Valentino approach and associated resources. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 10
