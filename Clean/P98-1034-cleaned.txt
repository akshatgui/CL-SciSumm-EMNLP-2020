While early approaches to the NP-chunking task (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) relied on part-of-speech information alone, it is widely accepted that lexical information (word forms) is crucial for building accurate systems for these tasks. $$$$$ Ramshaw & Marcus, however, provide the learning algorithm with word-level information in addition to the partof-speech information used in our base NP finder.

The approaches tested were Error Driven Pruning (EDP) (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) and Transformational Based Learning of IOB tagging (TBL) (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). $$$$$ Error-Driven Pruning of Treebank Grammars for Base Noun Phrase Identification
The approaches tested were Error Driven Pruning (EDP) (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) and Transformational Based Learning of IOB tagging (TBL) (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). $$$$$ More recently, Ramshaw & Marcus (In press) apply transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995) to the problem.

Conjunctions are a major source of errors for English chunking as well (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995, Cardie and Pierce, 1998), and we plan to address them in future work. $$$$$ The first base NP corpus is that used in the Ramshaw & Marcus work.
Conjunctions are a major source of errors for English chunking as well (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995, Cardie and Pierce, 1998), and we plan to address them in future work. $$$$$ Future work will concentrate on the corpusbased acquisition of local repair heuristics.

Our implementation of the NP-based QA system uses the Empire noun phrase finder, which is described in detail in Cardie and Pierce (1998). $$$$$ In this work we define base NPs to be simple, nonrecursive noun phrases — noun phrases that do not contain other noun phrase descendants.
Our implementation of the NP-based QA system uses the Empire noun phrase finder, which is described in detail in Cardie and Pierce (1998). $$$$$ As described above, our goal is to use the base NP corpus to extract and select a set of noun phrase rules that can be used to accurately identify base NPs in novel text.

(Cardie and Pierce, 1998) present an approach to chunking based on a mixture of finite state and context-free techniques. $$$$$ In particular, we present a corpus-based approach for finding base NPs by matching part-ofspeech tag sequences.

(Cardie and Pierce, 1998) store POS tag sequences that make up complete chunks and use these sequences as rules for classifying unseen data. $$$$$ Our treebank approach uses the simple technique of matching part-of-speech tag sequences, with the intention of capturing the simplicity of the corresponding syntactic structure.
