(Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) discusses a necessary component for an opinion question answering system $$$$$ Towards Answering Opinion Questions

We extract several types of features, including a set of pattern features, and then design a classifier to identify sentiment polarity for each question (similar as (Yuand Hatzivassiloglou, 2003)). $$$$$ We mapped article types News and Business to facts, and article types Editorial and Letter to the Editor to opinions.
We extract several types of features, including a set of pattern features, and then design a classifier to identify sentiment polarity for each question (similar as (Yuand Hatzivassiloglou, 2003)). $$$$$ In general, the additional features helped the classifier; the best performance is achieved when words, bigrams, trigrams, part-of-speech, and polarity are included in the feature set.

Our work is similar to Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) and Wiebe et al (1999) in that we use lexical and POS features. $$$$$ Much of the earlier research in automated opinion detection has been performed by Wiebe and colleagues (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999; Wiebe et al., 1999; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2002), who proposed methods for discriminating between subjective and objective text at the document, sentence, and phrase levels.
Our work is similar to Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) and Wiebe et al (1999) in that we use lexical and POS features. $$$$$ Bruce and Wiebe (1999) annotated 1,001 sentences as subjective or objective, and Wiebe et al. (1999) described a sentence-level Naive Bayes classifier using as features the presence or absence of particular syntactic classes (pronouns, adjectives, cardinal numbers, modal verbs, adverbs), punctuation, and sentence position.

Turney proposed the unsupervised method for sentiment classification (Turney, 2002), and similar method is utilized by many other researchers (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). $$$$$ For determining whether an opinion sentence is positive or negative, we have used seed words similar to those produced by (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and extended them to construct a much larger set of semantically oriented words with a method similar to that proposed by (Turney, 2002).
Turney proposed the unsupervised method for sentiment classification (Turney, 2002), and similar method is utilized by many other researchers (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). $$$$$ We first discuss how such words are automatically found by our system, and then describe the method by which we aggregate this information across the sentence.

Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. $$$$$ In addition, the presence of semantically oriented (positive and negative) words in a sentence is an indicator that the sentence is subjective (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000).
Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. $$$$$ To determine which words are semantically oriented, in what direction, and the strength of their orientation, we measured their co-occurrence with words from a known seed set of semantically oriented words.

Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) addressed three challenges in the news article domain $$$$$ We present a Bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level.
Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) addressed three challenges in the news article domain $$$$$ To measure the overall similarity of a sentence to the opinion or fact documents, we first select the documents that are on the same topic as the sentence in question.

Pang and Riloff (2005) and Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) trained sentence-level subjectivity classifiers and proved that performing sentiment analysis targeting selected subjective sentences only gets higher results. $$$$$ Our sentence-level classifiers introduce additional criteria for detecting subjective material (opinions), including methods based on sentence similarity within a topic and an approach that relies on multiple classifiers.

For example, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) separated facts from opinions and assigned polarities only to opinions. $$$$$ We cannot automatically select a sentence-level gold standard discriminating between facts and opinions, or between positive and negative opinions.

Indeed, recent work has shown that benefits can be made by first separating facts from opinions in a document (e.g, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)) and classifying the polarity based solely on the subjective portions of the document (e.g., Pang and Lee (2004)). $$$$$ Towards Answering Opinion Questions

At sentence level, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) propose to classify opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in opinionated sentences. $$$$$ We also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion.

The annotations in Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) are sentence-level subjective vs. objective and polarity judgments. $$$$$ Unlike the work cited above, we do not rely on human annotations for training but only on weak metadata provided at the document level.

These approaches rely on presence and scores of sentiment-bearing words that have been acquired from dictionaries (Kim and Hovy, 2005) or corpora (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003). $$$$$ We developed three different approaches to classify opinions from facts at the sentence level.
