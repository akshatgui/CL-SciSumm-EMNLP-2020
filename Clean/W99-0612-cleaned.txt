We can also exploit what Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) call the one sense per discourse phenomenon, the tendency of terms to have a fixed meaning within a single document. $$$$$ Moreover, he claims that the number of instances of the new entity is not associated with the document length but with the importance of the entity with regard to the subject/discourse.
We can also exploit what Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) call the one sense per discourse phenomenon, the tendency of terms to have a fixed meaning within a single document. $$$$$ We will use this property in conjunction with the one sense per discourse tendency noted by Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992b), who showed that words strongly tend to exhibit only one sense in a document/discourse.

 $$$$$ Beginning with some seed names for each class, the algorithm learns contextual patterns that are indicative for those classes and then iteratively learns new class members and word-internal morphological clues.

Earlier papers have taken a character-level approach to named entity recognition (NER), notably Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999), which used prefix and suffix tries, though to our knowledge incorporating all character grams is new. $$$$$ The reason for this is that the morphology models are full hierarchically smoothed character tries rather than word token tries, and hence have much denser initial statistics for small training data sets, proving greater partial matching potential for previously unseen words.

Previous work (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) was done using the complete words as features which suffers from a low recall problem. $$$$$ A language such as German would be roughly in the middle, where lower-case words have low probability as named entities, but capitalized words are highly ambiguous between common and proper nouns.

Prefix and suffix tries were also used previously (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999). $$$$$ Here the bipartite structure of the two pairs of tries has a central role

The bootstrapping stage (5) uses the initial or current entity assignments to estimate the class conditional distributions for both entities and contexts along their trie paths, and then re-estimates the distributions of the contexts/entity-candidates to which they are linked, recursively, until all accessible nodes are reached, as presented in Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999). $$$$$ Similarly, nodes of the context tries contain links to the tokens that occurred in the particular contexts defined by the paths.
