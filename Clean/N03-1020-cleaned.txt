Summarization evaluation is done using ROUGE-2 (R-2) (Lin and Hovy, 2003). $$$$$ The resulting Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (ρ) between BLEU and the human assessment for the single document task is 0.66 using one reference summary and 0.82 using three reference summaries; while Spearman ρ for the multidocument task is 0.67 using one reference and 0.70 using three.

Lin and Hovy (2003) have shown that a unigram co-occurrence statistic, computed with stop words ignored, between a summary and a set of models can be used to assign scores for a test suite that highly correlates with the scores assigned by human evaluators at DUC. $$$$$ Using DUC 2001 data, we compute average Ngram(1,4) scores for each peer system at different summary sizes and rank systems according to their scores.
