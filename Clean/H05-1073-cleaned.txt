These tools and resources have been already used in a large number of applications, including expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al, 2005), tracking sentiment timelines in on line forums and news (Balog et al, 2006), analysis of political debates (Carvalho et al, 2011), question answering (Oh et al., 2012), conversation summarization (Carenini et al., 2008), and citation sentiment detection (Athar and Teufel, 2012). $$$$$ A short study by (Sugimoto et al, 2004) addresses sentence-level emotion recognition forJapanese TTS.
