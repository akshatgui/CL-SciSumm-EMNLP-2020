Tokenisation and sentence splitting is followed by part-of speech tagging with the Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) tagger developed by Curran and Clark (2003) (here after referred to as C&C) for the CoNLL-2003 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), trained on the MedPost data (Smith et al, 2004). $$$$$ The papers from the CoNLL-2002 shared task which used such methods (e.g.
