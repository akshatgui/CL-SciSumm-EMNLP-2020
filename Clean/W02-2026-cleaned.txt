Nevertheless, Schafer and Yarowsky (2002) have shown that these two techniques can be combined efficiently. $$$$$ This behavior (shown quantatively in Figure 8) illustrates the contribution of consensus modeling over this set of diverse similarity measures.

Schafer and Yarowsky, (2002) independently proposed using frequency, orthographic similarity and also showed improvements using temporal and wordburstiness similarity measures, in addition to context. $$$$$ Note that in many cases the string-similarity-based orderings of the bridge candidates underperform individual non-string similarity measures, and they consistently underperform the weighted combiof all 8 similarity measures.

Our setup we used cosine similarity, Rapp (1999) used l1-norm metric after normalizing the vectors to unit length, Koehn and Knight (2002) used Spearman rank order correlation, and Schafer and Yarowsky (2002) use cosine similarity. $$$$$ The Serbian/Gujarati vocabularies we used were built by extracting all word types from the respective corpora, then filtering out lowfrequency words (since our similarity models require reliable corpus statistics) and very short words' (use of string distance to propose cognate candidates for very short words was seen to be unreliable in preliminary experiments).
