For example, requiring l not 0 and, if k not 0 then sk must be a child of sl in the source tree, we can implement a synchronous dependency grammar similar to (Melamed, 2004). $$$$$ For example, in Figure 6 a monolingual grammar has allowed only one dependency structure on the English side, and a word-to-word translation model has allowed only one word alignment.

Melamed (2004) establishes a theoretical framework for generalized synchronous parsing and translation. $$$$$ Figure 1 shows some of the ways in which ordinary parsing can be generalized.
Melamed (2004) establishes a theoretical framework for generalized synchronous parsing and translation. $$$$$ We shall limit our attention to MTGs in Generalized Chomsky Normal Form (GCNF) (Melamed et al., 2004).

When a parser's grammar can have fewer dimensions than the parser's input, we call it a synchronizer (Melamed, 2004). $$$$$ When a parser’s input can have fewer dimensions than the parser’s grammar, we call it a translator.

Our synchronous parser is similar to the synchronous CKY parser presented at (Melamed, 2004). $$$$$ The most straightforward way to create one is to parse some multitext using a synchronous parser, such as Parser C. However, if the goal is to bootstrap an-PMTG, then there is no-PMTG that can evaluate the terms in the parser’s logic.

Recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (Brown et al, 1993) and phrase based (Koehn et al, 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (Chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (Melamed, 2004). $$$$$ We shall limit our attention to MTGs in Generalized Chomsky Normal Form (GCNF) (Melamed et al., 2004).

Melamed (2004) formalizes machine translation problem as synchronous parsing based on multi text grammars. $$$$$ Statistical Machine Translation By Parsing
Melamed (2004) formalizes machine translation problem as synchronous parsing based on multi text grammars. $$$$$ Multitree-based statistical machine translation (MTSMT) is an architecture for SMT that revolves around multitrees.

To handle syntactic differences, Melamed (2004) proposes methods based on tree-to-tree mappings. $$$$$ Below: A graphical representation of the same tree.

A representative sample of modern syntax-based systems includes models based on bilingual synchronous grammar (Melamed, 2004), parse tree-to-string translation models (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and non isomorphic tree-to-tree mappings (Eisner, 2003). $$$$$ The tree exhibits both deletion and inversion in translation.

Melamed (2004) also used a similar way to integrate the language model. $$$$$ Indeed, the language of multitrees can be viewed as an interlingua.
