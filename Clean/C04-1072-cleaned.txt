In Lin and Och (2004), we proposed a framework that automatically evaluated automatic MT evaluation metrics using only manual translations without further human involvement. $$$$$ In this paper, we introduce a new evaluation method, ORANGE, for evaluating automatic machine translation evaluation metrics automatically without extra human involvement other than using a set of reference translations.

There are several advantages of the proposed ORANGE evaluation method: ? No extra human involvement ? ORANGE uses the existing human references but not human evaluations.

This locality assumption eases efficient implementation of our algorithm, and can be realized using a sentence-level evaluation measure such as BLEU+1 (Lin and Och, 2004). $$$$$ We adopt this assumption and add one more assumption that automatic translations are usually worst than their reference translations.

ROUGE utilizes, skip n-grams, which allow for matches of sequences of words that are not necessarily adjacent (Lin and Och, 2004a). $$$$$ Therefore, for candidate translations with less than n words, they can still get a positive smoothed BLEU score from shorter n-gram matches; however if nothing matches then they will get zero scores.

BLEU is smoothed (Lin and Och, 2004b), and it considers only matching up to bi grams because this has higher correlations with human judgments than when higher-ordered n-grams are included. $$$$$ Therefore, Y1 would be ranked higher than Y2 using WLCS.

Metrics in the Rouge family allow for skip n-grams (Lin and Och,2004a); Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) take para phrasing into account; metrics such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and GTM (Melamedetal., 2003) calculate both recall and precision; ME TEOR is also similar to SIA (Liu and Gildea, 2006) in that word class information is used. $$$$$ Turian et al (2003) introduced General Text Matcher (GTM) based on accuracy measures such as recall, precision, and F-measure.

As F1 score is not decomposable, we optimize sentence-level F1 score which serves as an approximation of the corpus-level F1 score. Similarly, Hopkins and May optimize a sentence level BLEU approximation (Lin and Och, 2004) in stead of the corpus-level BLEU score (Papinenietal., 2002). $$$$$ The other potential problem for correlation analysis of human vs. automatic framework is that high corpus-level correlation might not translate to high sentence-level correlation.

While the F measure over Precision and Recall satisfies these constraints, precision and recall in isolation do not satisfy all of them: maximum recall can be achieved without resembling the gold standard text decomposition; and maximum precision can be achieved with only a few overlapped elements.BLEU (Papineni et al, 2001a) computes the n gram precision while the metric ROUGE (LinandOch, 2004a) computes the n-gram recall. $$$$$ Turian et al (2003) introduced General Text Matcher (GTM) based on accuracy measures such as recall, precision, and F-measure.
