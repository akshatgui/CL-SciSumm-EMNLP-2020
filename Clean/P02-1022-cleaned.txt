Perspective GATE (Cunningham et al, 2002a) is an architecture, a framework and a development environment for human language technology modules and applications. $$$$$ 3 Applications One of GATE's strengths is that it is flexible and robust enough to enable the development of a wide range of applications within its framework.

The GATE API (Application Programming Interface) is fully documented in Javadoc and also examples are given in the comprehensive User Guide (Cunningham et al, 2002b). $$$$$ Applications developed within GATE can be deployed outside its Graphical User Interface (GUI), using programmatic access via the GATE API (see http: //gat e . ac .uk).
The GATE API (Application Programming Interface) is fully documented in Javadoc and also examples are given in the comprehensive User Guide (Cunningham et al, 2002b). $$$$$ When the application is run, the modules will be executed in the specified order on the given document.

JAPE is a version of CPSL (Common Pattern Specification Language) (Appelt, 1996) and is used to describe patterns to match and annotations to be created as a result (for further details see (Cunningham et al, 2002b)). $$$$$ JAPE is a version of CPSL (Common Pattern Specification Language) (Appelt, 1996), which provides finite state transduction over annotations based on regular expressions.

 $$$$$ We are also extending the system to handle language generation modules, in order to enable the construction of applications which require language production in addition to analysis, e.g. intelligent report generation from IE data.

The automatic alignments have then been manually corrected through a graphical editing tool within the GATE framework (Cunningham et al, 2002). $$$$$ GATE: A Framework And Graphical Development Environment For Robust NLP Tools And Applications
The automatic alignments have then been manually corrected through a graphical editing tool within the GATE framework (Cunningham et al, 2002). $$$$$ The annotation can be done manually by the user or semi-automatically by running some processing resources over the corpus and then correcting/adding new annotations manually.

The GATE system (Cunningham et al., 2002) is used to tag named entities, which are categorized as <Person>, <Organization>, <Location> and <Date>. $$$$$ It also has a secondary role in improving named entity recognition by assigning annotations to previously unclassified names, based on relations with existing entities. identity relations between entities in the text.

In order to produce the gold standard annotations in GerManC-GS we used the GATE platform, which facilitates automatic as well as manual annotation (Cunningham et al 2002). $$$$$ Neither the splitter nor the tagger are a mandatory part of the NE system, but the annotations they produce can be used by the grammar (described below), in order to increase its power and coverage.
In order to produce the gold standard annotations in GerManC-GS we used the GATE platform, which facilitates automatic as well as manual annotation (Cunningham et al 2002). $$$$$ The semantic tagger consists of handcrafted rules written in the JAPE (Java Annotations Pattern Engine) language (Cunningham et al., 2002), which describe patterns to match and annotations to be created as a result.

Linguistic analysis of textual input is carried out using the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) - a framework for the development and deployment of language processing technology in large scale (Cunningham et al, 2002). $$$$$ A vital part of any language engineering application is the evaluation of its performance, and a development environment for this purpose would not be complete without some mechanisms for its measurement in a large number of test cases.

The algorithm was implemented using the GATE NLP framework (Cunningham et al, 2002) and texts preprocessed using the tokeniser, sentence splitter, and part-of-speech (POS) tagger provided with GATE. $$$$$ ANNIE consists of the following main processing resources: tokeniser, sentence splitter, POS tagger, gazetteer, finite state transducer (based on GATE's built-in regular expressions over annotations language (Cunningham et al., 2002)), orthomatcher and coreference resolver.

We developed a set of algorithms along with existing NLP tools (GATE (Cunningham et al, 2002) etc.) for this task. $$$$$ In this section, we describe briefly some of the NLP applications we have developed using the GATE architecture.

For named-entity recognition, we use GATE (Cunningham et al, 2002), augmented with named entity lists for locations, food types, restaurant names, and food subtypes (e.g. pizza), scraped from the we8there web pages. $$$$$ It also has a secondary role in improving named entity recognition by assigning annotations to previously unclassified names, based on relations with existing entities. identity relations between entities in the text.

Similarly, we define additional features using the gazetteers from GATE, (Cunningham et al., 2002) namely, countries, person first/last names, trigger words;. $$$$$ Similarly, separating data from its visualisation allows users to develop alternative visual resources, while still using a language resource provided by GATE.
