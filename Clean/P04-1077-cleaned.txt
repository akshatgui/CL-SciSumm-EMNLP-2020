Skip bigrams, generally speaking, are pairs of words in a sentence order with arbitrary gap (Lin and Och, 2004a). $$$$$ If we set dskip to 4 then only word pairs of at most 4 words apart can form skip-bigrams.

Different from the previous skip bigram statistics which compare sentence similarities through overlapping skip bigrams (Lin and Och, 2004a), the skip bigrams we used are weighted by a decaying factor of the skipping gap in a sentence, giving higher scores to closer occurrences of skip bigrams. $$$$$ Skipbigram co-occurrence statistics measure the overlap of skip-bigrams between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations.
