However, those works targeted a small subset of Levin classes, and a limited number of monosemous verbs; for example, Merlo and Stevenson (2001) studied three classes and 59 verbs, and Joanis et al (2008) focused on 14 classes and 835 verbs. $$$$$ On the other hand, each of the three classes is comprised of multiple Levin classes, because the latter reflect more detailed semantic distinctions among the verbs (Levin 1993); thus, classification based on Levin's labeling would miss generalizations across the three broader classes.

As a cue to this alternation, Merlo and Stevenson (2001) create a bag of head nouns for each of the two potentially alternating slots, and compare them. $$$$$ Alternations are detected by testing the hypothesis that, given any verb, the selectional preferences for arguments occurring in alternating slots will be more similar to each other than those for slots that do not alternate.

The method used by Merlo and Stevenson (2001) has the advantage of directly capturing similarity between slots (in terms of use of identical nouns [lemmas]), but fails to generalize over the nouns, lending itself to sparse data problems. $$$$$ Note the importance of our use of frequency distributions: the claim is not that only Agents can be animate, but rather that nouns that receive an Agent role will more often be animate than nouns that receive a Theme role.
