However, the cost is the decrease in performance to about 53% F-measure on the same data (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999) which may be unsuitable for a lot of tasks. $$$$$ Subsequent tests with different values for r on the formal evaluation data set also obtained optimal performance with r= 4.

Although approaches to coreference resolution that rely only on clustering could easily enforce transitivity (as in Cardie and Wagstaff (1999)), they have not performed as well as state-of-the-art approaches to coreference. $$$$$ Existing systems for noun phrase coreference resolution can be broadly characterized as learning and non-learning approaches.

Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) have proposed an unsupervised approach which also incorporates cluster information into consideration. $$$$$ Azzam et al. (1998), for example, describe a focus-based approach that incorporates discourse information when resolving pronouns.
Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) have proposed an unsupervised approach which also incorporates cluster information into consideration. $$$$$ Second, our approach is unsupervised and requires no annotation of training data, nor a large corpus for computing statistical occurrences.

The closest comparable unsupervised system is Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) who use pairwise NP distances to cluster document mentions. $$$$$ Our approach, on the other hand, uses unsupervised learning4 and requires no training data.5 In addition, both MLR and RESOLVE require an additional mechanism to coordinate the collection of pairwise coreference decisions.
The closest comparable unsupervised system is Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) who use pairwise NP distances to cluster document mentions. $$$$$ Without this mechanism, it is possible that the decision tree classifies NP i and NP i as coreferent, and NP i and NPk as coreferent, but NP i and NPk as not coreferent.

The system of Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) uses the node distance in WordNet (with an upper limit of 4) as one component in the distance measure that guides their clustering algorithm. $$$$$ The subsections below describe the noun phrase representation, the distance metric, and the clustering algorithm in turn.

For the first subtask we use the same set of features as in Cardie and Wagstaff (1999). $$$$$ Given an input text, we first use the Empire noun phrase finder (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) to locate all noun phrases in the text.

Coreference resolution on text datasets is well studied (e.g., (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999)). $$$$$ Furthermore, our approach has a number of important advantages over existing learning and non-learning methods for coreference resolution

We employ a set of verbal features that is similar to the features used by state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems that operate on text (e.g., (Cardieand Wagstaff, 1999)). $$$$$ It contains two base noun phrases

Coreference resolution is often performed in two phases $$$$$ The first baseline marks every pair of noun phrases as coreferent, i.e. all noun phrases in the document form one class.
