Gale and Church (1991) and Brown (1991) report the early works using length statistics of bilingual sentences. $$$$$ We will report just the first two.

All sentences are aligned using a tool based on the Gale and Church (1991) algorithm. $$$$$ The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences.
All sentences are aligned using a tool based on the Gale and Church (1991) algorithm. $$$$$ Now, let us consider how sentences can be aligned within a paragraph.

Brown, Lai and Mercer (Brown et al, 1991) used word count as the sentence length, whereas Gale and Church (Gale and Church, 1991) used character count. $$$$$ We used the same procedure which is used in (Church, 1988).
Brown, Lai and Mercer (Brown et al, 1991) used word count as the sentence length, whereas Gale and Church (Gale and Church, 1991) used character count. $$$$$ It might seem that words are a more natural linguistic unit than characters (Brown, Lai and Mercer, 1991).

Using this search method meant that no prior segmentation of the corpora was needed (Moore, 2002), either in terms of aligned paragraphs (Gale and Church, 1991), or some aligned sentences as anchors (Brown et al, 1991). $$$$$ The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences.

One reason for this is that there are more of characters than words (Gale and Church, 1991). $$$$$ However, we have found that words do not perform nearly as well as characters.
One reason for this is that there are more of characters than words (Gale and Church, 1991). $$$$$ We obtain a(m)/m ratios of 0.22 for characters and 0.33 for words, indicating that characters are less noisy than words, and are therefore more suitable for use in align.

Alignment is performed using dynamic programming (Gale and Church, 1991) with a weight function based on the number of common words in a sentence pair. $$$$$ This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework in order to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.

In (Gale and Church, 1991) and (Brown et al, 1991), the authors start from the fact that the length of a source text sentence is highly correlated with the length of its target text translation $$$$$ The model makes use of the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.
In (Gale and Church, 1991) and (Brown et al, 1991), the authors start from the fact that the length of a source text sentence is highly correlated with the length of its target text translation $$$$$ The model was motivated by the observation that longer regions of text tend to have longer translations, and that shorter regions of text tend to have shorter translations.

Gale and Church (1991) extract pairs of anchor words, such as numbers, proper noduns (organization, person, title), dates, and monetary information. $$$$$ Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus which has a much smaller error rate.

We were motivated by statistical alignment models such as (Gale and Church, 1991) to investigate whether byte-length probabilities could improve or replace the lexical matching based method. $$$$$ This paper describes a method for aligning sentences in these parallel texts, based on a simple statistical model of character lengths.

Automatic sentential alignment (Gale and Church, 1991) will be necessary if we have already had on line bilingual texts. $$$$$ Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., al., and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoulcermann, 1990) have recently become interested in studying parallel texts, texts such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings) which are available in multiple languages (French and English).
Automatic sentential alignment (Gale and Church, 1991) will be necessary if we have already had on line bilingual texts. $$$$$ If necessary, it is possible to fit the six parameters in the model with language-specific values, though, thus far, we have not found it necessary (or even helpful) to do so.

Gale and Church (1991) noted that the byte length ratio of target sentence to source sentence is normally distributed. $$$$$ A probabilistic score is assigned to each pair of proposed sentence pairs, based on the ratio of lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this ratio.
Gale and Church (1991) noted that the byte length ratio of target sentence to source sentence is normally distributed. $$$$$ We have found that a sentence in one language normally matches exactly one sentence in the other language (1-1), three additional possibilities are also considered

For bilingual texts, Gale and Church (1991) demonstrated the extraordinary effectiveness of a global alignment dynamic programming algorithm, where the basic similarity score was based on the difference in sentence lengths, measured in characters. $$$$$ This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework in order to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.

A bilingual sentence alignment program (Gale and Church, 1991, and Brown et al, 1991) is the crucial part in this adaptation procedure, in that it collects bilingual document pairs from the Inter net, and identifies sentence pairs, which should have a high likelihood of being correct translations of each other. $$$$$ A Program For Aligning Sentences In Bilingual Corpora

Many parallel corpora have been built, such as the Canadian Hansards (Gale and Church, 1991), the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005), the Arabic-English and English-Chinese parallel corpora used in the NIST Open MT Evaluation. $$$$$ A Program For Aligning Sentences In Bilingual Corpora

Once the search space is reduced, the system aligns the sentences using the well-known sentence-length model described in (Gale and Church, 1991). $$$$$ The next two alignments below illustrate the more typical case where one English sentence aligns with exactly one French sentence.

The Bayesian prior can be estimated as per Gale and Church (1991) by assuming that it is equal to the frequency of distinct n-m matches in the training set. $$$$$ The final alignment matches two English sentences to a single French sentence.
