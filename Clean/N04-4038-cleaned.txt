Both Diab et al (2004) and Habash and Rambow (2005) use support-vector machines with local features; the former for tokenization, POS tagging, and base phrase chunking; the latter for full morphological disambiguation. $$$$$ In this task, we use a setup similar to that of (Kudo and Matsumato, 2000), where 9 types of chunked phrases are recognized using a phrase IOB tagging scheme; Inside I a phrase, Outside O a phrase, and Beginning B of a phrase.

We use AMIRA (Diab et al, 2004) to annotate Arabic and Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994) to annotate German. $$$$$ In this paper, we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach to automatically tokenize (segmenting off clitics), part-ofspeech (POS) tag and annotate base phrases (BPs) in Arabic text.
We use AMIRA (Diab et al, 2004) to annotate Arabic and Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994) to annotate German. $$$$$ ChunkLink flattens the tree to a sequence of base (non-recursive) phrase chunks with their IOB labels.

Arabic text is then segmented with AMIRA (Diab et al, 2004) according to the ATB scheme. $$$$$ Automatic Tagging Of Arabic Text: From Raw Text To Base Phrase Chunks
Arabic text is then segmented with AMIRA (Diab et al, 2004) according to the ATB scheme. $$$$$ We adapt highly accurate tools that have been developed for English text and apply them to Arabic text.

This scheme is compatible with the chunker we use (Diab et al, 2004). $$$$$ In this task, we use a setup similar to that of (Kudo and Matsumato, 2000), where 9 types of chunked phrases are recognized using a phrase IOB tagging scheme; Inside I a phrase, Outside O a phrase, and Beginning B of a phrase.
This scheme is compatible with the chunker we use (Diab et al, 2004). $$$$$ The following example illustrates the tagging scheme: Input: A sequence of (word, POS tag) pairs.

For chunking Arabic, we use the AMIRA (ASVMT) toolkit (Diab et al, 2004). $$$$$ In this paper, we propose solutions to the problems of Tokenization, POS Tagging and BP Chunking of Arabic text.
For chunking Arabic, we use the AMIRA (ASVMT) toolkit (Diab et al, 2004). $$$$$ These results are interesting in light of state-of-the-art for English BP chunking performance which is at an score of 93.48, against a baseline of 77.7 in CoNLL 2000 shared task (Tjong et al., 2000).

In supervised POS tagging, (Diab et al, 2004) achieves high accuracy on MSA with the direct application of SVM classifiers. $$$$$ Using standard evaluation metrics, we report that the SVM-TOR tokenizer achieves an score of 99.12, the SVM-POS tagger achieves an accuracy of 95.49%, and the SVM-BP chunker yields an score of 92.08. your (yours), your (yours) [masc. dual], your (yours) [masc. pl.
In supervised POS tagging, (Diab et al, 2004) achieves high accuracy on MSA with the direct application of SVM classifiers. $$$$$ Thereby, we address them using the same SVM experimental setup which comprises a standard SVM as a multiclass classifier (Allwein et al., 2000).
