In Goodman (1996), an efficient parsing strategy is given that maximizes the expected number of correct constituents. $$$$$ We solve the second problem by a novel deterministic parsing strategy that maximizes the expected number of correct constituents, rather than the probability of a correct parse tree.
In Goodman (1996), an efficient parsing strategy is given that maximizes the expected number of correct constituents. $$$$$ Next, we present an algorithm for parsing, which returns the parse that is expected to have the largest number of correct constituents.

 $$$$$ The construction is as follows.
 $$$$$ This research also shows the importance of testing on more than one small test set, as well as the importance of not making cross-corpus comparisons; if a new corpus is required, then previous algorithms should be duplicated for comparison.

Although Sima'an (1996) and Goodman (1996) also report experiments on unedited ATIS trees, their results do not refer to the most probable parse but to the most probable derivation and the maximum constituents parse respectively. $$$$$ First, one can find the most probable derivation.

This does not scale well to large treebanks, forcing the use of implicit representations (Goodman, 1996) or heuristic subsets (Bod, 2001). $$$$$ Unlike a PCFG, the use of trees allows capturing large contexts, making the model more sensitive.
This does not scale well to large treebanks, forcing the use of implicit representations (Goodman, 1996) or heuristic subsets (Bod, 2001). $$$$$ In other words, rather than using the large, explicit STSG, we can use this small PCFG that generates isomorphic derivations, with identical probabilities.

Although see (Goodman 1996) for an efficient algorithm for the DOP model, which we discuss in section 7 of this paper. $$$$$ Khalil Sima'an (1996) implemented a version of the DOP model, which parses efficiently by limiting the number of trees used and by using an efficient most probable derivation model.

(Goodman 1996) gives a polynomial time conversion of a DOP model into an equivalent PCFG whose size is linear in the size of the training set. $$$$$ In this paper, we introduce a reduction of the DOP model to an exactly equivalent Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) that is linear in the number of nodes in the training data.

The relation between DOP and enrichment/conditioning models was clarified by Joshua Goodman, who devised an efficient PCFG transform of the DOP1 model (Goodman, 1996). $$$$$ Efficient Algorithms For Parsing The DOP Model
The relation between DOP and enrichment/conditioning models was clarified by Joshua Goodman, who devised an efficient PCFG transform of the DOP1 model (Goodman, 1996). $$$$$ In theory, the DOP model has several advantages over other models.

Although we omit the details, we can prove the NP-hardness by observing that a stochastic tree substitution grammar (STSG) can be represented by a PCFG-LA model in a similar way to one described by Goodman (1996a), and then using the NP-hardness of STSG parsing (Sima'an, 2002). $$$$$ Now, use these trees to form a Stochastic Tree Substitution Grammar (STSG).

Implicit grammars Goodman (1996, 2003 ) defined a transformation for some versions of DOP to an equivalent PCFG-based model, with the number of rules extracted from each parse tree linear in the size of the trees. $$$$$ In this paper, we introduce a reduction of the DOP model to an exactly equivalent Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG) that is linear in the number of nodes in the training data.

Probabilities for the PCFG rules are computed monolingually as in the standard Goodman reduction for DOP (Goodman, 1996). $$$$$ There are eight cases, one for each of the eight rules.

The difference is that Goodman (1996a) collapses our BEGIN and END rules into the binary productions, giving a larger grammar which is less convenient for weighting. $$$$$ There are eight cases, one for each of the eight rules.

The most probable parse can be estimated by iterative Monte Carlo sampling (Bod 1995), but efficient algorithms exist only for sub-optimal solutions such as the most likely derivation of a sentence (Bod 1995, Simaa'as; an 1995) or the labelled recall parse of a sentence (Goodman 1996). $$$$$ First, one can find the most probable derivation.
