Several approaches utilize source data for training on a limited number of target labels, including feature splitting (Daume, 2007) and adding the source classifier' s prediction as a feature (Chelba and Acero, 2004). $$$$$ There are a number of parameters to be tuned on development data.
Several approaches utilize source data for training on a limited number of target labels, including feature splitting (Daume, 2007) and adding the source classifier' s prediction as a feature (Chelba and Acero, 2004). $$$$$ The adaptation procedure was found cut-off threshold used for feature selection on CNNtrn adaptation data; the entry corresponding to the cut-off threshold of 106 represents the number of features in the background model to be insensitive to the number of reestimation iterations, and, more surprisingly, to the number of features added to the background model from the adaptation data, as shown in 5.
