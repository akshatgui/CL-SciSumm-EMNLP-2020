The limitation of deterministic transfer rules has been recognized in prior work (Riezler et al, 2002). $$$$$ The grammar uses several lexicons and two guessers: one guesser for words recognized by the morphological analyzer but not in the lexicons and one for those not recognized.

 $$$$$ In this version of the corpus, all WSJ labels with -SBJ are retained and are restricted to phrases corresponding to SUBJ in the LFG grammar; in addition, it contains NP under VP (OBJ and OBJth in the LFG grammar), all -LGS tags (OBL-AG), all -PRD tags (XCOMP), VP under VP (XCOMP), SBAR- (COMP), and verb POS tags under VP (V in the c-structure).
 $$$$$ Under this measure, our system achieves 76.1% F-score.

Alternatively, a single input parse could be selected by stochastic models such as the one described in Riezler et al (2002). $$$$$ The evaluation measure counts the number of predicateargument relations in the f-structure of the parse selected by the stochastic model that match those in the gold standard annotation.
Alternatively, a single input parse could be selected by stochastic models such as the one described in Riezler et al (2002). $$$$$ 4 In our evaluation, we report F-scores for both types of annotation, LFG and DR, and for three types of parse selection, (i) lower bound: random choice of a parse from the set of analyses (averaged over 10 runs), (ii) upper bound: selection of the parse with the best F-score according to the annotation scheme used, and (iii) stochastic: the parse selected by the stochastic disambiguator.

Riezler et al (2002) describe a discriminative LFG parsing model that is trained on standard (syntax only) tree bank annotations by treating each tree as a full LFG analysis with an observed c-structure and hidden f-structure. $$$$$ The WSJ labeled brackets are given LFG lexical entries which constrain both the c-structure and the f-structure of the parse.

For our experiments, we used a stochastic parsing system for LFG that we trained on section 02-21 of the UPenn Wall Street Journal treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) by discriminative estimation of a conditional maximum-entropy model from partially labeled data (see Riezler et al.
