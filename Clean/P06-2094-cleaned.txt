Our work is related to previous work on domain independent unsupervised relation extraction, in particular Sekine (2006), Shinyama and Sekine (2006) and Banko et al (2007).

Shinyama and Sekine (2006) apply NER, coreference resolution and parsing to a corpus of newspaper articles to extract two-place relations between NEs. $$$$$ For these topics, the number of relevant articles in the corpus is relatively high and interesting relations are found.

Like Sekine (2006) and Shinyama and Sekine (2006), we concentrate on relations involving NEs, the assumption being that these relations are the potentially interesting ones. $$$$$ For these topics, the number of relevant articles in the corpus is relatively high and interesting relations are found.
Like Sekine (2006) and Shinyama and Sekine (2006), we concentrate on relations involving NEs, the assumption being that these relations are the potentially interesting ones. $$$$$ However, the results are limited to a pair of participants and because of the nature of the procedure, the discovered relations are static relations like a country and its presidents rather than events.

Romano et al (2006) and Sekine (2006) used syntactic paraphrases to obtain patterns for extracting relations. $$$$$ Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Main Conference Poster Sessions, pages 731–738, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics relationships between patterns, i.e. to find patterns which should be used to build the same table, we use paraphrase discovery techniques.
Romano et al (2006) and Sekine (2006) used syntactic paraphrases to obtain patterns for extracting relations. $$$$$ (Hasegawa et al. 2004) used large corpora and an Extended Named Entity tagger to find novel relations and their participants.

This contrasts with Open Information Extraction (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) and On-Demand Information Extraction (Sekine, 2006), which aim to extract large databases of open-ended facts, and with supervised relation extraction, which requires additional supervised data to learn new relations. $$$$$ On-Demand Information Extraction

For instance, Sudo et al (2003) and Sekine (2006) proposed different methods for automatic IE pattern acquisition for a given domain based on frequent subtree discovery in dependency parse trees. $$$$$ Several unsupervised pattern discovery techniques have been proposed, e.g.
For instance, Sudo et al (2003) and Sekine (2006) proposed different methods for automatic IE pattern acquisition for a given domain based on frequent subtree discovery in dependency parse trees. $$$$$ Most recently we (Sudo et al. 03) proposed a method which is triggered by a user query to discover important patterns fully automatically.

To reduce the knowledge engineering burden on the user in constructing and porting an IE system, unsupervised learning has been utilized, e.g. Riloff (1996), Yangarber et al (2000), and Sekine (2006). $$$$$ (Riloff 96), (Agichtein and Gravano 00) and (Yangarber et al. 00).
