One may object that this example is somewhat far-fetched, but Chiang (2000) notes that head-lexicalized stochastic grammars fall short in encoding even simple dependency relations such as between left and John in the sentence John should have left. $$$$$ For example, for the sentence &quot;John should have left,&quot; Magerman's rules make should and have the heads of their respective VPs, so that there is no dependency between left and its subject John (see Figure 2a).

The only other model that uses frontier lexicalization and that was tested on the standard WSJ split is Chiang (2000) who extracts a stochastic tree-insertion grammar or STIG (Schabes; Waters 1996) from the WSJ, obtaining 86.6% LP and 86.9% LR for sentences 40 words. $$$$$ The formalism we use is a variant of lexicalized tree-insertion grammar (LTIG), which is in turn a restriction of LTAG (Schabes and Waters, 1995).

They induce a probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammar from a training set algning frames and sentences using the grammar induction technique of (Chiang, 2000) and use a beam search that uses weighted features learned from the training data to rank alternative expansions at each step. $$$$$ We discuss the advantages of lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar as an alternative to lexicalized PCFG for statistical parsing, describing the induction of a probabilistic LTAG model from the Penn Treebank and evaluating its parsing performance.

In particular, our grammars differs from the traditional probabilistic Tree Adjoining Grammar extracted as described in e.g., (Chiang, 2000) in that they encode both syntax and semantics rather than just syntax. $$$$$ Statistical Parsing With An Automatically-Extracted Tree Adjoining Grammar

We use sister adjunction which is commonly used in LTAG statistical parsers to deal with the relatively flat Penn Tree bank trees (Chiang, 2000). $$$$$ We introduce this operation simply so we can derive the flat structures found in the Penn Treebank.

In LTAG-based statistical parsers, high accuracy is obtained by using the Magerman Collins head-percolation rules in order to provide the etrees (Chiang, 2000). $$$$$ But beginning with (Magerman, 1995) statistical parsers have used bilexical dependencies with great success.

Our implementation uses an extension of our monolingual parser (Chiang, 2000) based on tree-substitution grammar with sister adjunction (TSG+SA) . $$$$$ In this variant there are three kinds of elementary tree: initial, (predicative) auxiliary, and modifier, and three composition operations: substitution, adjunction, and sister-adjunction.

Indeed, since TAGLET thus induces bigram dependency structures from trees, this invites the estimation of probability distributions on TAGLET derivations based on observed bigram dependencies; see (Chiang, 2000). $$$$$ Bilexical dependencies are not the only nonlocal dependencies that can be used to improve parsing accuracy.
Indeed, since TAGLET thus induces bigram dependency structures from trees, this invites the estimation of probability distributions on TAGLET derivations based on observed bigram dependencies; see (Chiang, 2000). $$$$$ But none of these cases really requires special treatment in a PTAG model, because each composition probability involves not only a bilexical dependency but a &quot;biarboreal&quot; (tree-tree) dependency.

While earlier approaches such as Hwa (1998) and Chiang (2000) relied on hueristic induction methods, they were nevertheless sucessful at parsing. $$$$$ We find that this induction method is an improvement over the EM-based method of (Hwa, 1998), and that the induced model yields results comparable to lexicalized PCFG.

While different representations make direct comparison inappropriate, the OSTAG results lie in the same range as previous work with statistical TIG on this task, such as Chiang (2000) (86.00) and Shindo et al (2011) (85.03). $$$$$ Sister-adjunction is not an operation found in standard definitions of TAG, but is borrowed from D-Tree Grammar (Rambow et al., 1995).

In addition to adjunction, we also use sister adjunction as defined in the LTAG statistical parser described in (Chiang, 2000). $$$$$ Auxiliary trees and adjunction are restricted as in TIG: essentially, no wrapping adjunction or anything equivalent to wrapping adjunction is allowed.
In addition to adjunction, we also use sister adjunction as defined in the LTAG statistical parser described in (Chiang, 2000). $$$$$ We also extended the parser to simulate sister-adjunction as regular adjunction and compute the flag f which distinguishes the first modifier from subsequent modifiers.

Improvements along this line may be attained by use of a full TAG parser, such as Chiang (2000) for example. $$$$$ Note that even in cases where the parser encounters a sentence for which the (fallible) extraction heuristics would have produced an unseen tree template, it is possible that the parser will use other trees to produce the correct bracketing.
Improvements along this line may be attained by use of a full TAG parser, such as Chiang (2000) for example. $$$$$ Moreover, the greater flexibility of TAG suggests some potential improvements which would be cumbersome to implement using a lexicalized CFG.

A striking use of sister adjunction in (Chiang, 2000) is exactly the elegant way it solves this problem: the non-argument tree can be adjoined onto a node (say, VP), positioning itself in between the VP's children, which is not possible with TAGs. $$$$$ An arc corresponding to the sister-adjunction of a tree between the ith and i + 1th children of rl (allowing for two imaginary children beyond the leftmost and rightmost children) is labeled rl; i.
