It has also been shown that these techniques prove useful for tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al, 2003), real-word spelling correction (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) and information extraction (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005), among others. $$$$$ This approach has been shown to successfully acquire useful extraction patterns which, when added to an IE system, improved its performance (Yangarber et al., 2000).

(2003) convert this distance metric into a similarity measure by taking its multiplicative inverse.

 $$$$$ As mentioned above, the second part of a pattern element-filler pair can be either a lexical item or a semantic category, such as company.

Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) evaluated their method through document and sentence filtering at the scenario level. $$$$$ Soderland (1999) developed a version of the MUC-6 corpus in which events are marked at the sentence level.
Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) evaluated their method through document and sentence filtering at the scenario level. $$$$$ Adding the supplementary corpus to the data set used by the document-centric approach led to an improvement of around 15% on the document filtering task and over 70% for sentence filtering.

Many of the adaptive IE systems rely on the existing part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Debnath and Giles, 2005) and/or syntactic parsers (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) for analysing and annotating text corpora. $$$$$ We begin by describing the general process of pattern induction and an existing approach, based on the distribution of patterns in a corpus (Section 2).
Many of the adaptive IE systems rely on the existing part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Debnath and Giles, 2005) and/or syntactic parsers (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) for analysing and annotating text corpora. $$$$$ This evaluation is similar to the “text-filtering” sub-task used in the sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) (1995) in which systems were evaluated according to their ability to identify the documents relevant to the extraction task.

Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) propose a weakly supervised approach to sentence filtering that uses semantic similarity and bootstrapping to acquire IE patterns. $$$$$ This pattern similarity measure can be used to create a weakly supervised approach to pattern acquisition following the general outline provided in Section 2.
Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) propose a weakly supervised approach to sentence filtering that uses semantic similarity and bootstrapping to acquire IE patterns. $$$$$ The precision scores for the sentence filtering task in Table 2 show that the semantic similarity algorithm consistently learns more accurate patterns than the existing approach.

Our method is modeled on the approach developed by Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) but uses a different technique for ranking candidate patterns. $$$$$ A key choice in the development of such an algorithm is step 4, the process of ranking the candidate patterns, which effectively determines which of the candidate patterns will be learned.
Our method is modeled on the approach developed by Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) but uses a different technique for ranking candidate patterns. $$$$$ The approach to IE pattern acquisition presented here is related to other techniques but uses different assumptions regarding which patterns are likely to be relevant to a particular extraction task.

Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) use subject-verb-object triples for their features. $$$$$ Under this scheme patterns consist of triples representing the subject, verb and object (SVO) of a clause.
Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) use subject-verb-object triples for their features. $$$$$ For example, the pattern COMPANY+fired+ceo consists of three pairs: subject COMPANY, verb fired and object ceo.

This is a significant improvement over the 0.58 F-measure score reported by Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) for the same task. $$$$$ Initially seed patterns are given a maximum confidence score of 1 and all others a 0 score.
This is a significant improvement over the 0.58 F-measure score reported by Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) for the same task. $$$$$ The best score recorded by the proposed algorithm on the sentence filtering task is an F-measure of 0.58 (22nd iteration).

Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) suggested an alternative method for ranking the candidate patterns. $$$$$ We experimented with several techniques for ranking candidate patterns based on these scores, including using the best and average score, and found that the best results were obtained when each candidate pattern was ranked according to its score when compared against the centroid vector of the set of currently accepted patterns.

To our knowledge, the only previous study that embeds similarities into the acquisition of extraction patterns is (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005). $$$$$ This paper presents a novel algorithm for the acquisition of Information Extraction patterns.
To our knowledge, the only previous study that embeds similarities into the acquisition of extraction patterns is (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005). $$$$$ Early IE systems were based on knowledge engineering approaches but suffered from a knowledge acquisition bottleneck.

We adapted the method of matrix similarity given by Stevenson and Greenwood (2005). $$$$$ This shows how these patterns are represented as vectors and gives a sample semantic similarity matrix.
We adapted the method of matrix similarity given by Stevenson and Greenwood (2005). $$$$$ Under our interpretation of the similarity matrix, W, this equates to each pattern element-filler pair being identical to itself but not similar to anything else.
