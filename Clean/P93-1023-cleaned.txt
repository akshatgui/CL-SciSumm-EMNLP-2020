Early approaches to attribute learning include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), who cluster adjectives that denote values of the same attribute. $$$$$ Also, because each pair of adjectives in a cluster is considered an observed association, the relationship between the number of associations produced by a cluster and the number of adjectives in the cluster is not linear (a cluster with k adjectives will produce () k 0(k2) associations).

In this paper, we concentrate on adjectives, which have received less attention (see though Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Lapata (2001)). $$$$$ (Matsukawa, 1993)).
In this paper, we concentrate on adjectives, which have received less attention (see though Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Lapata (2001)). $$$$$ For example, in the sample set of adjectives discussed in the previous section, the association (foreign, international) received a correctness value of 1, since all the humans placed these two adjectives in the same group, while the association (legal, severe) received a correctness value of 0.

As evaluation measure, we used a pair-wise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic fscore as follows $$$$$ The third stage combines the opinions of the various similarity modules in a single dissimilarity measure for any pair of adjectives.
As evaluation measure, we used a pair-wise measure which calculates precision, recall and a harmonic fscore as follows $$$$$ We also compute a combined measure for recall and precision, the F-measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979), which always takes a value between the values of recall and precision, and is higher when recall and precision are closer; it is defined as where 3 is the weight of recall relative to precision; we use 13.1.0, which corresponds to equal weighting of the two measures.

We acknowledge previous work on the computational study of adjectival scales as in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), where a system could group gradation scales using a clustering algorithm. $$$$$ Towards The Automatic Identification Of Adjectival Scales
