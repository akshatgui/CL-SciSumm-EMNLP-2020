We have found that the identification of the association between a candidate answer and a question depends on (a) the recognition of predicates and entities based on both the output of a named entity recognizer and a semantic parser (Surdeanu et al, 2003) and their structuring into predicate-argument frames. $$$$$ This statistical technique of labeling predicate argument operates on the output of the probabilistic parser reported in (Collins, 1997).

Surdeanu et al (2003) applied semantic parsing to capture the predicate-argument sentence structure. $$$$$ To identify correctly the verb particle and capture it in the structure of predicates instead of the argument structure, we introduced two collocation features that measure the frequency with which verbs and succeeding prepositions cooccurr in the corpus.
