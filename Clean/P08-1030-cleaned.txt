Ji and Grishman (2008) extended the one sense per discourse idea (Yarowsky, 1995) to multiple topically related documents and propagate consistent event arguments across sentences and documents. $$$$$ We apply the hypothesis of “One Sense Per Discourse” (Yarowsky, 1995) to information extraction (IE), and extend the scope of “discourse” from one single document to a cluster of topically-related documents.

We then apply the cross-document inference techniques as described in (Ji and Grishman, 2008) to improve trigger and argument labeling performance by favoring interpretation consistency across the test events and background events. $$$$$ We can take advantage of these alternate descriptions to improve event extraction in the original document, by favoring consistency of interpretation across sentences and documents.

(Ji and Grishman 2008) have observed that the events in a cluster of documents on the same topics as documents in the training corpus can be tagged more confidently. $$$$$ Fortunately, many of these events will be reported multiple times, in different forms, both within the same document and within topicallyrelated documents (i.e. a collection of documents sharing participants in potential events).
(Ji and Grishman 2008) have observed that the events in a cluster of documents on the same topics as documents in the training corpus can be tagged more confidently. $$$$$ On the other hand, if a word is not tagged as an event trigger in most related documents, then it’s less likely to be correct in the test sentence despite its high local confidence.

We followed Ji and Grishman (2008)'s approach and used the INDRI retrieval system (Strohman et al, 2005) to obtain the top N related documents for each annotated document in the training corpus. $$$$$ We then use the INDRI retrieval system (Strohman et al., 2005) to obtain the top N (N=25 in this paper3) related documents.

There are two common assumptions within a cluster of related documents (Ji and Grishman 2008): Trigger Consistency Per Cluster: if one instance of a word triggers an event, other instances of the same word will trigger events of the same type. $$$$$ As we shall describe below, we can make use of consistency at several levels: consistency of word sense across different instances of the same word in related documents, and consistency of arguments and roles across different mentions of the same or related events.
There are two common assumptions within a cluster of related documents (Ji and Grishman 2008): Trigger Consistency Per Cluster: if one instance of a word triggers an event, other instances of the same word will trigger events of the same type. $$$$$ So if we can determine the sense (event type) of a word in the related documents, this will allow us to infer its sense in the test document.

For ST_IR and ST_GI, we retrieved the best N (using N=25, which (Ji and Grishman 2008) found to work best) related texts for each training document from the English TDT5 corpus consisting of 278,108 news texts (from April to September of 2003). $$$$$ We used 10 newswire texts from ACE 2005 training corpora (from March to May of 2003) as our development set, and then conduct blind test on a separate set of 40 ACE 2005 newswire texts.

Ji and Grishman (2008) further exploit a correlation between senses of verbs (that are triggers for events) and topics of documents. Our work shares some similarities. $$$$$ Fortunately, many of these events will be reported multiple times, in different forms, both within the same document and within topicallyrelated documents (i.e. a collection of documents sharing participants in potential events).
Ji and Grishman (2008) further exploit a correlation between senses of verbs (that are triggers for events) and topics of documents.

Although this figure is very low, it is not surprising: the results on the English ACE 2005 corpus show that the inter-annotator agreement on trigger identification is only about 40% (Ji and Grishman, 2008). $$$$$ We used 10 newswire texts from ACE 2005 training corpora (from March to May of 2003) as our development set, and then conduct blind test on a separate set of 40 ACE 2005 newswire texts.

The second reason is that it is hard to identify an event mention due to the failure of following specified annotation guidelines, as mentioned in Ji and Grishman (2008). $$$$$ But the same annotation for this mention doesn’t appear again in the related documents, so we can determine it’s a spurious argument.
The second reason is that it is hard to identify an event mention due to the failure of following specified annotation guidelines, as mentioned in Ji and Grishman (2008). $$$$$ For example it’s hard to decide whether “named” represents a “Personnel_Nominate” or “Personnel_Start-Position” event mention; “hacked to death” represents a “Life_Die” or “Conflict_Attack” event mention without following more specific annotation guidelines.

We use a state-of-the-art IE system (Ji and Grishman, 2008) developed for the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program to process texts and automatic speech recognition output. $$$$$ In this paper we demonstrate that appreciable improvements are possible over the variety of event types in the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) evaluation through the use of cross-sentence and cross-document evidence.

Ji and Grishman (2008) enforce event role consistency across different documents. $$$$$ As we shall describe below, we can make use of consistency at several levels: consistency of word sense across different instances of the same word in related documents, and consistency of arguments and roles across different mentions of the same or related events.

A typical event extraction/discovery system (Ji and Grishman, 2008) fails to discover the war event due to the lack of context information (Benson et al, 2011), and thus fails to shed light on the users focus/interests. $$$$$ For example, for a sentence: the event extractor should detect a “Personnel_End-Position” event mention, with the trigger word, the position, the person who quit the position, the organization, and the time during which the event happened: We define the following standards to determine the correctness of an event mention: We use a state-of-the-art English IE system as our baseline (Grishman et al., 2005).

Ji and Grishman (2008) extracts event mentions (belonging to a predefined list of target event types) and their associated arguments. $$$$$ ACE defines the following terminology: entity: an object or a set of objects in one of the semantic categories of interest mention: a reference to an entity (typically, a noun phrase) event trigger: the main word which most clearly expresses an event occurrence event arguments: the mentions that are involved in an event (participants) event mention: a phrase or sentence within which an event is described, including trigger and arguments The 2005 ACE evaluation had 8 types of events, with 33 subtypes; for the purpose of this paper, we will treat these simply as 33 distinct event types.
