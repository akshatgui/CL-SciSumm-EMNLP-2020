We then apply the cross-document inference techniques as described in (Ji and Grishman, 2008) to improve trigger and argument labeling performance by favoring interpretation consistency across the test events and background events. $$$$$ We can take advantage of these alternate descriptions to improve event extraction in the original document, by favoring consistency of interpretation across sentences and documents.

Later, Ji and Grishman (2008) employed a rule-based approach to propagate consistent triggers and arguments across topic-related documents. $$$$$ Based on the fact that many other instances of “hurt” are not “Life_Injure” triggers in the related documents, we can successfully remove this wrong event mention in the test document.

(Ji and Grishman 2008) have observed that the events in a cluster of documents on the same topics as documents in the training corpus can be tagged more confidently. $$$$$ Fortunately, many of these events will be reported multiple times, in different forms, both within the same document and within topicallyrelated documents (i.e. a collection of documents sharing participants in potential events).
(Ji and Grishman 2008) have observed that the events in a cluster of documents on the same topics as documents in the training corpus can be tagged more confidently. $$$$$ On the other hand, if a word is not tagged as an event trigger in most related documents, then it’s less likely to be correct in the test sentence despite its high local confidence.

We followed Ji and Grishman (2008)'s approach and used the INDRI retrieval system (Strohman et al, 2005) to obtain the top N related documents for each annotated document in the training corpus. $$$$$ We then use the INDRI retrieval system (Strohman et al., 2005) to obtain the top N (N=25 in this paper3) related documents.

There are two common assumptions within a cluster of related documents (Ji and Grishman 2008) $$$$$ As we shall describe below, we can make use of consistency at several levels

For ST_IR and ST_GI, we retrieved the best N (using N=25, which (Ji and Grishman 2008) found to work best) related texts for each training document from the English TDT5 corpus consisting of 278,108 news texts (from April to September of 2003). $$$$$ We used 10 newswire texts from ACE 2005 training corpora (from March to May of 2003) as our development set, and then conduct blind test on a separate set of 40 ACE 2005 newswire texts.

Although this figure is very low, it is not surprising $$$$$ As shown in table 5 the inter-annotator agreement on trigger identification is only about 40%.

The second reason is that it is hard to identify an event mention due to the failure of following specified annotation guidelines, as mentioned in Ji and Grishman (2008). $$$$$ But the same annotation for this mention doesn’t appear again in the related documents, so we can determine it’s a spurious argument.
The second reason is that it is hard to identify an event mention due to the failure of following specified annotation guidelines, as mentioned in Ji and Grishman (2008). $$$$$ For example it’s hard to decide whether “named” represents a “Personnel_Nominate” or “Personnel_Start-Position” event mention; “hacked to death” represents a “Life_Die” or “Conflict_Attack” event mention without following more specific annotation guidelines.

We use a state-of-the-art IE system (Ji and Grishman, 2008) developed for the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program to process texts and automatic speech recognition output. $$$$$ In this paper we demonstrate that appreciable improvements are possible over the variety of event types in the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) evaluation through the use of cross-sentence and cross-document evidence.
