Previous evaluation of Addicter shows that hypothesis-reference alignment coverage (in terms of discovered word pairs) directly influences error analysis quality; to increase alignment coverage we used Berkeley aligner (Liang et al, 2006) and trained it on and applied it to the whole set of reference-hypothesis pairs for every language pair. $$$$$ Each z can be thought of as an element in the set of generalized alignments, where any subset of word pairs may be aligned (Och and Ney, 2003).
