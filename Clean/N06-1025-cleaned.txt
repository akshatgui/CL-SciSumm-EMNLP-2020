Also, on WS-353, our hybrid sense-filtered variants and word-cos-ll obtained a correlation score higher than published results using WordNet-based measures (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003) (.33 to .35) and Wikipedia based methods (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006) (.19 to .48); and very close to the results obtained by thesaurus-based (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003) (.55) and LSA-based methods (Finkelstein et al, 2002) (.56). $$$$$ We enrich the semantic information available to the classifier by using semantic similarity measures based on the WordNet taxonomy (Pedersen et al., 2004).

Our baseline coreference system implements the standard machine learning approach to coreference resolution (see Ng and Cardie (2002b), Ponzetto and Strube (2006), Yang and Su (2007), for instance), which consists of probabilistic classification and clustering, as described below. $$$$$ The last years have seen a boost of work devoted to the development of machine learning based coreference resolution systems (Soon et al., 2001; Ng & Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004, inter alia).
