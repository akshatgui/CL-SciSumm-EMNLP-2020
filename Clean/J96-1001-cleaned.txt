This score is used, for instance, in the collocation compiler XTract (Smadja, 1993) and in the lexicon extraction system Champollion (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ To evaluate Champollion, we used a collocation compiler, XTRACT (Smadja 1993), to automatically produce several lists of source (English) collocations.

Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem of collocation identification, we may say that we are more interested in precision than recall (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ His evaluation shows 68% precision and 64% recall.
Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem of collocation identification, we may say that we are more interested in precision than recall (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ But even if we artificially impose some lower ceiling for m—say three times the length of the source language collocation—we run into the second, and more severe, problem of the exhaustive approach.

This highlights the need for finding multi-word translation correspondences. Previous works that focus on multi-word translation correspondences from parallel corpora include noun phrase correspondences (Kupiec, 1993), fixed flexible collocations (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ Kupiec (1993) describes a technique for finding noun phrase correspondences in bilingual corpora using several stages.

Our preliminary finding supports the work on collocation by Smadja et al (1996) in that gapped sequences are also an important class of multi-word translations. $$$$$ One of the major differences between their work and ours is that, like van der Eijk and Kupiec, they only handle translation of uninterrupted sequences of words; they do not handle the broader class of flexible collocations.
Our preliminary finding supports the work on collocation by Smadja et al (1996) in that gapped sequences are also an important class of multi-word translations. $$$$$ The error is due to the fact that the French word important did not pass the first step of the algorithm as its Dice coefficient with important factor was too low.

Smadja et al (1996) limits to find French translation of English collocation identified by his Xtract system. $$$$$ To evaluate Champollion, we used a collocation compiler, XTRACT (Smadja 1993), to automatically produce several lists of source (English) collocations.
Smadja et al (1996) limits to find French translation of English collocation identified by his Xtract system. $$$$$ For example, a tagger for French would allow us to run XTRACT on the French part of the corpus, and thus to translate from either French or English as input.

The relationship between pointwise Mutual Information and the Dice coefficient is also discussed in (Smadja et al, 1996). $$$$$ On the other hand, in computational linguistics, information-theoretic measures such as mutual information are widely used (e.g., Bahl et al. 1986; Church and Hanks 1990; Church et al.

A number of corpus-based methods to extract bilingual lexicons have been proposed (Smadja et al,1996). $$$$$ Translating Collocations For Bilingual Lexicons

 $$$$$ Finally, another criterion for selecting a similarity measure is its suitability for testing for a particular outcome, where outcome is determined by the application.

Our method is similar to that of Smadja et al (1996), except that we incorporate lexical-level information into the association-based method. $$$$$ Our goal is to provide a tool for compiling bilingual lexical information above the word level in multiple languages, for different domains.

Our MWE translation extraction method is similar to the two-phase approach proposed by Smadja et al (1996). $$$$$ To achieve efficient processing of the corpus database, Champollion is implemented in two phases

As noted by Smadja et al (1996), this two-step approach drastically reduces the search space. $$$$$ Stage 1—Step 1

However, translations of collocated context words in the source word sequence create noisy candidate words, which might cause incorrect extraction of target translations by naive statistical correlation measures, such as the Dice coefficient used by Smadja et al (1996). $$$$$ Then, Termight identifies candidate translations for each occurrence of a source term by using the word alignment to find the first and last target positions aligned with any words of the source terms.
However, translations of collocated context words in the source word sequence create noisy candidate words, which might cause incorrect extraction of target translations by naive statistical correlation measures, such as the Dice coefficient used by Smadja et al (1996). $$$$$ Let 131 be the number of translations with i words that are examined by Champollion, and Si the number of these translations that actually survive the thresholds and will be used to generate the candidate translations with i +1 words.

Aligning parallel text, i.e. automatically setting the sentences or words in one text into correspondence with their equivalents in a translation, is a very useful preprocessing step for a range of applications, including but not limited to machine translation (Brown et al, 1993), cross-language information retrieval (Hiemstra, 1996), dictionary creation (Smadja et al, 1996) and induction of NLP-tools (Kuhn, 2004). $$$$$ The recent availability of large amounts of bilingual data has attracted interest in several areas, including sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991b; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Gale and Church 1993; Chen 1993), word alignment (Gale and Church 1991a; Brown et al. 1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994; Fung 1995b), alignment of groups of words (Smadja 1992; Kupiec 1993; van der Eijk 1993), and statistical translation (Brown et al.

Smadja et al (1996) proposed a statistical association measure of the Dice coefficient to deal with the problem of collocation translation. $$$$$ For each run of Champollion, and for each input collocation, we took the final set of candidate translations of different lengths produced by Champollion (with the intermediate stages driven by the Dice coefficient) and compared the results obtained using both the Dice coefficient and SI at the last stage for selecting the proposed translation.
