Those relations between the sense and its defining words are reflected in semantic dusters that are termed categorical, functional, and situational clusters in McRoy (1992). $$$$$ TRUMP's knowledge base contains three types of clusters

Moreover, those relations have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994). $$$$$ Using Multiple Knowledge Sources For Word Sense Discrimination
Moreover, those relations have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994). $$$$$ These properties are all either retrievable directly from a knowledge base or computable from short sequences of words.

Even if most of the techniques for WSD are presented as stand-alone, it is our belief, following the ideas of (McRoy, 1992), that full-fledged lexical ambiguity resolution should combine several information sources and techniques. $$$$$ Approaches based on the word disambiguation model tend to apply constraint satisfaction techniques to combine these role preferences (Hirst 1987).
Even if most of the techniques for WSD are presented as stand-alone, it is our belief, following the ideas of (McRoy, 1992), that full-fledged lexical ambiguity resolution should combine several information sources and techniques. $$$$$ Our system uses a tagging program, written by Uri Zernik (1990), that takes information about the root, affix, and possible syntactic category for each word and applies stochastic techniques to select a syntactic tag for each word.

 $$$$$ When the syntactic constraints (such as io-rec, one-obj, and no-obj) influence semantic preferences, they are attached to the sense entry.

We propose a tagger that makes use of several types of information (dictionary definitions, parts-of-speech, domain codes, selectional preferences and collocates) in the tradition of McRoy (McRoy, 1992) although, the information sources we use are orthogonal, unlike the sources he used, making it easier to evaluate the performance of the various modules. $$$$$ Here we will describe how to use the whole range of information.

This approach as been recently used by (McRoy, 1992) and (Mahesh and Beale, 1996). $$$$$ For example, according to our lexicon, when safe is used as an adjective (as in Example 1), it always denotes the sense related to security, whereas safe used as a noun always denotes a type of container for storing valuables.

There are a variety of methods for combining multiple knowledge sources (linguistic cues) (McRoy, 1992). $$$$$ In the next section, we will describe how a semantic interpreter can apply knowledge from such a wide variety of sources.

McRoy (1992) describes a study of different sources useful for word sense disambiguation, including morphological information. $$$$$ The approach to disambiguation that we will take below combines many different, strong sources of information
