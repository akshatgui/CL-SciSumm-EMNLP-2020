Recently, Dowding et al (1993) reported syntactic and semantic coverage of 86% for the DARPA Airline reservation corpus (Dowding et al, 1993). $$$$$ The repair correction mechanism helps increase the syntactic and semantic coverage of Gemini (as reported in Table 1).

In a test set containing 26 repairs (Dowding et al, 1993), they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 84.6%; for correction, they obtained a recall rate of 30% and a recall rate of 62%. $$$$$ Similarly, the 756utterance test set contained 26 repairs, of which Gemini found 11(42%).

Dowding et al (1993) used a similar setup for their data. $$$$$ Many systems (Carbonell and Hayes, 1983), (Hobbs et al., 1992), (Seneff, 1992), (Stallard and Bobrow, 1992) have added robustness with a similar postprocessing phase.

Typed Unification Grammars (TUG), like HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) and Gemini (Dowding et al. 1993) are a more expressive formalism in which to write formal grammars. $$$$$ This formalism is related directly to the Core Language Engine, but more conceptually it is closely related to that of other unification-based grammar formalisms with a context-free skeleton, such as PATR-II (Shieber et al., 1983), Categorial Unification Grammar (Uszkoreit, 1986), Generalized Phrase-Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al., 1982), Gemini differs from other unification formalisms in the following ways.

Initial language processing is carried out Using the SRI Gemini system (Dowding et al, 1993), using a domain-independent unification. $$$$$ GEMINI

We use the Open Agent Architecture (Martin et al 1999) for communication between agents based on the Nuance speech recognizer, the Gemini natural language system (Dowding et al 1993), and Festival speech synthesis. $$$$$ GEMINI

Finally, we are developing an interface to a new large-vocabulary version of the Gemini parser (Dowding et al, 1993) which will allow us to use semantic parse information as features in the individual sub-class classifiers, and also to extract entity and event representations from the classified utterances for automatic addition of entries to calendars and to-do lists. $$$$$ Processing starts in Gemini when syntactic, semantic, and lexical rules are applied by a bottom-up all-paths constituent parser to populate a chart with edges containing syntactic, semantic, and logical form information.

Questions are posed to GeoLogica in a subset of English and translated into logic by a natural language parser, the system Gemini (Dowding et al, 1993). $$$$$ GEMINI

This is contrasted with the all-paths bottom-up strategy in GEMINI (Dowding et al 1993) that finds all admissable edges of the grammar. $$$$$ Processing starts in Gemini when syntactic, semantic, and lexical rules are applied by a bottom-up all-paths constituent parser to populate a chart with edges containing syntactic, semantic, and logical form information.

To handle the ASR results of disfluent utterances, we employ SRI's Gemini robust language parser (Dowding et al, 1993). $$$$$ GEMINI

The most likely hypothesis is input to SRI's Gemini natural language parser/generator (Dowding et al. 1993), which attempts to parse the speech recognition output. $$$$$ GEMINI

The dialogue system uses the Nuance 8.0 speech recognizer with language models compiled from a grammar (written using the Gemini system (Dowding et al, 1993)), which is also used for parsing and generation. $$$$$ All three are written in a variant of the unification formalism used in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) .
The dialogue system uses the Nuance 8.0 speech recognizer with language models compiled from a grammar (written using the Gemini system (Dowding et al, 1993)), which is also used for parsing and generation. $$$$$ The approach taken in Gemini differs in that the utterance grammar uses the same syntactic and semantic rule formalism used by the constituent grammar.

Annotating sub-constituents with grammatical relations regularizes the syntactic structure with respect to particular grammatical rules, and allows a 'relation-to-relation' form of compositionality, as opposed to the more traditional 'rule-to-rule' version that is exemplified by such systems as Gemini (Dowding et al 1993) and the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992). $$$$$ All three are written in a variant of the unification formalism used in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) .
