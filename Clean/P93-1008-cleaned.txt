Recently, Dowding et al (1993) reported syntactic and semantic coverage of 86% for the DARPA Airline reservation corpus (Dowding et al, 1993). $$$$$ The repair correction mechanism helps increase the syntactic and semantic coverage of Gemini (as reported in Table 1).

In a test set containing 26 repairs (Dowding et al, 1993), they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 84.6%; for correction, they obtained a recall rate of 30% and a recall rate of 62%. $$$$$ Similarly, the 756utterance test set contained 26 repairs, of which Gemini found 11(42%).

Typed Unification Grammars (TUG), like HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) and Gemini (Dowding et al. 1993) are a more expressive formalism in which to write formal grammars. $$$$$ This formalism is related directly to the Core Language Engine, but more conceptually it is closely related to that of other unification-based grammar formalisms with a context-free skeleton, such as PATR-II (Shieber et al., 1983), Categorial Unification Grammar (Uszkoreit, 1986), Generalized Phrase-Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al., 1982), Gemini differs from other unification formalisms in the following ways.

Finally, we are developing an interface to a new large-vocabulary version of the Gemini parser (Dowding et al, 1993) which will allow us to use semantic parse information as features in the individual sub-class classifiers, and also to extract entity and event representations from the classified utterances for automatic addition of entries to calendars and to-do lists. $$$$$ Processing starts in Gemini when syntactic, semantic, and lexical rules are applied by a bottom-up all-paths constituent parser to populate a chart with edges containing syntactic, semantic, and logical form information.

The dialogue system uses the Nuance 8.0 speech recognizer with language models compiled from a grammar (written using the Gemini system (Dowding et al, 1993)), which is also used for parsing and generation. $$$$$ All three are written in a variant of the unification formalism used in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) .

Annotating sub-constituents with grammatical relations regularizes the syntactic structure with respect to particular grammatical rules, and allows a 'relation-to-relation' form of compositionality, as opposed to the more traditional 'rule-to-rule' version that is exemplified by such systems as Gemini (Dowding et al 1993) and the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992). $$$$$ All three are written in a variant of the unification formalism used in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) .
