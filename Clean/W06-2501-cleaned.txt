An extension by Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) differentiated context word senses and extended shorter glosses with related glosses in WordNet. $$$$$ This simple definition is extended to take advantage of the complex network of relations in WordNet, and allows the glosses of concepts to include the glosses of synsets to which they are directly related in WordNet.

One possible explanation for the unsuitability of the measures of (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) for the coordinate similarity task could be based on how context is defined when building context vectors. $$$$$ However, dictionary glosses tend to be rather short, and it is possible that even closely related concepts will be defined using different sets of words.

Other measures have been proposed that utilize the text in WordNet's definitional glosses, such as Extended Lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) and later the Gloss Vectors (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) method. $$$$$ (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) introduce Extended Gloss Overlaps, which is a measure that determines the relatedness of concepts proportional to the extent of overlap of their WordNet glosses.

Mohammad and Hirst (2006) and Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) argued that word sense ambiguity is a key reason for the poor performance of traditional distributional measures, and they proposed hybrid approaches that are distributional in nature, but also make use of information in lexical resources such as published thesauri and WordNet. $$$$$ In this paper we introduce a WordNet-based measure of semantic relatedness inspired by Harris’ Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1985).

Effectively, this formalizes the notion that two concepts related to a third concept is also semantically related, which is similar to the hypothesis proposed by Patwardhan and Pedersen (2006) in their method based on second-order context vectors. $$$$$ The concept of food, therefore, is in the same semantic space as and is related to the concept of fork.
