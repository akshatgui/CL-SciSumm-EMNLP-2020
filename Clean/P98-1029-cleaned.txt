Committee-based approaches to POS tagging have been in focus the last decade: Brill and Wu (1998) combined four different taggers for English using unweighted voting and by exploring contextual cues (essentially a variant of stacking). $$$$$ We ran experiments to determine whether the outputs of the different taggers could be effectively combined.

In NLP, such methods have been applied to tasks such as POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Pedersen, 2000), parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999), and machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ In transformation-based tagging (Brill (1995)), every word is first assigned an initial tag, This tag is the most likely tag for a word if the word is known and is guessed based upon properties of the word if the word is not known.

The complementarity between two learners was defined by Brill and Wu (1998) in order to quantify the percentage of time when one system is wrong, that another system is correct, and therefore providing an upper bound on combination accuracy. $$$$$ # of errors in A only In other words, Comp(A,B) measures the percentage of time when tagger A is wrong that tagger B is correct.

The data used in the experiment was selected from the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal, and is the same used by Brill and Wu (1998). $$$$$ Next, we show how this complementary behavior can be used to our advantage.

The investigated MMVC model proves to be a very effective participant in classifier combination, with substantially different output to Naive Bayes (9.6% averaged complementary rate, as defined in Brill and Wu (1998)). $$$$$ In Figure 2 we show the complementary rates between the different taggers.

One opossibility is the example-based combiner in Brill and Wu (1998, Sec. 3.2). $$$$$ For example, when the oracle can examine the output of the Maximum Entropy, Transformation-Based and Trigram taggers, it could achieve an error rate of 1.62%.

Related work includes learning ensembles of POS taggers, as in the work of Brill and Wu (1998), where an ensemble consisting of a unigram model, an N-gram model, a transformation-based model, and an MEMM for POS tagging achieves substantial results beyond the individual taggers. $$$$$ Whereas the transformation-based tagger enforces multiple constraints by having multiple rules fire, the maximum-entropy tagger can have all of these constraints play a role at setting the probability estimates for the model's parameters.

This suggests that the final accuracy number presented here could be slightly improved upon by classifier combination, it is worth noting that not only is this tagger better than any previous single tagger, but it also appears to outperform Brill and Wu (1998), the best-known combination tagger (they report an accuracy of 97.16% over the same WSJ data, but using a larger training set, which should favor them). $$$$$ Classifier Combination for Improved Lexical Disambiguation

Numerous methods for combining classifiers have been proposed and utlized to improve the performance of different NLP tasks such as part of speech tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998), identifying base noun phrases (Tjong Kim Sang et al, 2000), named entity extraction (Florian et al, 2003), etc. $$$$$ In the future, we plan to expand our repertoire of base taggers, to determine whether performance continues to improve as we add additional systems.

Combination techniques have earlier been applied to various applications including machine translation (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), part-of-speech tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998) and base noun phrase identification (Sang et al., 2000). $$$$$ Another possibility could be that all of the different machine learning techniques are essentially doing the same thing.
