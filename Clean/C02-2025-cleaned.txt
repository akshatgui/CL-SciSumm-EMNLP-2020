To address this limitation, the Redwoods treebank has been created to provide annotated training material to permit statistical models for ambiguity resolution to be combined with the precise interpretations produced by the ERG (Oepen et al, 2002). $$$$$ While shallow and probabilistic processing techniques have produced use- ful results in many classes of applications, they have not met the full range of needs for NLP, particularly where precise interpretation is important, or where the variety of linguistic expression is large relative to the amount of training data available.
