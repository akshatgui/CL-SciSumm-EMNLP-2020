However, as phrase-based decoding usually casts translation as a string concatenation problem and permits arbitrary permutation, it proves to be NP-complete (Knight, 1999). $$$$$ We show that for the simplest form of statistical models, this problem is NP-complete, i.e., probably exponential in the length of the observed sentence.

In (Knight,1999) it was proved that the Exact Decoding problem is NP-Hard when the language model is a bigram model. $$$$$ As with tagging, we can assume an alphabet of v source tokens, a bigram source model, a substitution channel model, and an m-token coded text.

Part of the complexity arises from the expressive power of the translation model: for example, a phrase or word-based model with full reordering has exponential complexity (Knight, 1999). $$$$$ Decoding Complexity In Word-Replacement Translation Models
Part of the complexity arises from the expressive power of the translation model: for example, a phrase or word-based model with full reordering has exponential complexity (Knight, 1999). $$$$$ The former is more closely tied to the source model, and the latter to the channel model, though the complexity arises from the interaction of the two.

This approach offers four features absent from IBM-style models: (1) a recursive phrase-based translation, (2) a syntax-based language model, (3) the ability to condition a word's translation on the translation of syntactically related words, and (4) polynomial-time optimal alignment and decoding (Knight, 1999). $$$$$ Decoding Complexity In Word-Replacement Translation Models

Both of the two steps are very time-consuming due to the exponential number of translation rules and the complex nature of machine translation as an NP-hard search problem (Knight, 1999). $$$$$ We review it here for purposes of comparison with machine translation.
