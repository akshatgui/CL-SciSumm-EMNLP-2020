This is similar to the idea of topic signature introduced in (Lin and Hovy 2000). $$$$$ Our idea is simple.

As a byproduct of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms (Lin and Hovy, 2000). $$$$$ They are sentence-based and applied to text categorization.

Lin and Hovy (2000) first introduced topic signatures which are topic relevant terms for summarization. $$$$$ 

In this regard, we use a method similar to Lin and Hovy (2000) to identify signature terms and subsequently use them to discard sentences that contain none or few such terms. $$$$$ We expect high rank- ing bigram and trigram signature terms to be very informative.
