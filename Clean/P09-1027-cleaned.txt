To overcome the shortcomings of available resources and to take advantage of ensemble systems, Wan (2008) and Wan (2009) explored methods for developing a hybrid system for Chinese using English and Chinese sentiment analyzers. $$$$$ In this study, we focus on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages only English training data for supervised sentiment classification of Chinese product reviews, without using any Chinese resources.

To reduce this kind of error introduced by the translator, Wan in (Wan, 2009) applied a co-training scheme. $$$$$ The co-training algorithm is then applied to learn two classifiers and finally the two classifiers are combined into a single sentiment classifier.
To reduce this kind of error introduced by the translator, Wan in (Wan, 2009) applied a co-training scheme. $$$$$ During the bootstrapping process of smoothed co-training, the classifier at each iteration is replaced with a majority voting scheme applied to all classifiers constructed at previous iterations.

But as the conditional distribution can be quite different for the original language and the pseudo language produced by the machine translators, these two strategies give poor performance as reported in (Wan, 2009). $$$$$ SVM, NB), and the classification performance is far from satisfactory because of the language gap between the original language and the translated language.
But as the conditional distribution can be quite different for the original language and the pseudo language produced by the machine translators, these two strategies give poor performance as reported in (Wan, 2009). $$$$$ As shown in our experiments, the above two methods do not perform well for Chinese sentiment classification, either, because the underlying distribution between the original language and the translated language are different.

For comparsion, we use the same data set in (Wan, 2009): Test Set (Labeled Chinese Reviews): The data set contains a total of 886 labeled product reviews in Chinese (451 positive reviews and 435 negative ones). $$$$$ The following three datasets were collected and used in the experiments: Test Set (Labeled Chinese Reviews): In order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, we collected and labeled 886 product reviews (451 positive reviews + 435 negative reviews) from a popular Chinese IT product web site-IT1688.

The features we used are bigrams and unigrams in the two languages as in (Wan, 2009). $$$$$ However, such resources in different languages are very imbalanced.

We compare our procedure with the co-training scheme reported in (Wan, 2009): CoTrain: The method with the best performance in (Wan, 2009). $$$$$ In the experiments, we first compare the proposed co-training approach (I=40 and p=n=5) with the eight baseline methods.

More recently, Wan (2009) proposed a co training approach to tackle the problem of cross lingual sentiment classification by leveraging an available English corpus for Chinese sentiment classification. $$$$$ Co-Training for Cross-Lingual Sentiment Classification
More recently, Wan (2009) proposed a co training approach to tackle the problem of cross lingual sentiment classification by leveraging an available English corpus for Chinese sentiment classification. $$$$$ This paper focuses on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages an available English corpus for Chinese sentiment classification by using the English corpus as training data.

Similarly, other multilingual sentiment approaches also require parallel text, often supplied via automatic translation; after the translated text is available, either monolingual analysis (Denecke, 2008) or co-training is applied (Wan, 2009). $$$$$ Google Translate applies statistical learning techniques to build a translation model based on both monolingual text in the target language and aligned text consisting of examples of human translations between the languages.

Wan (2009) combined the annotated English reviews, unannotated Chinese reviews and their translations to co-train two separate classifiers for each language, respectively. $$$$$ First, machine translation services are used to translate English training reviews into Chinese reviews and also translate Chinese test reviews and additional unlabeled reviews into English reviews.
Wan (2009) combined the annotated English reviews, unannotated Chinese reviews and their translations to co-train two separate classifiers for each language, respectively. $$$$$ Given the labeled English reviews and unlabeled Chinese reviews, two straightforward methods for addressing the problem are as follows: 1) We first learn a classifier based on the labeled English reviews, and then translate Chinese reviews into English reviews.
