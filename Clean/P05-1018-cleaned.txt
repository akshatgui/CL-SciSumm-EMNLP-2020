The entity grid approach has already been applied to many applications relying on local coherence estimation $$$$$ Modeling Local Coherence

The experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to significantly outperform the state-of the-art coherence model by Barzilay and Lapata (2005), reducing the error rate of the previous approach by an average of 29% over three data sets against human upper bounds. $$$$$ Our experiments demonstrate that the induced model achieves significantly higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art coherence model.

To further refine the computation of the subsequence distribution, we follow (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) and divide the matrix into a salient matrix and a non-salient matrix. $$$$$ Following Foltz et al. (1998) we constructed vector-based representations for individual words from a lemmatized version of the North American News Text Corpus (350 million words) using a term-document matrix.
To further refine the computation of the subsequence distribution, we follow (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) and divide the matrix into a salient matrix and a non-salient matrix. $$$$$ Salience Finally, we evaluate the contribution of salience information by comparing our original model (Coreference+Syntax+Salience) which accounts separately for patterns of salient and non-salient entities against a model that does not attempt to discriminate between them (Coreference+Syntax).

 $$$$$ For example, the entity Microsoft is mentioned twice in Sentence 1 with the grammatical roles x (for Microsoft Corp.) and s (for the company), but is represented only by s in the grid (see Tables 1 and 2). for coherence assessment that is based on grid representation.
 $$$$$ We plan to investigate how to combine the two for improved prediction on both local and global levels, with the ultimate goal of handling longer texts.

Barzilay and Lapata (2005) showed that their entity based model is able to distinguish a source text from its permutation accurately. $$$$$ Then, we introduce our entity-based representation, and describe our ranking model.
Barzilay and Lapata (2005) showed that their entity based model is able to distinguish a source text from its permutation accurately. $$$$$ Text Representation Each text is represented by an entity grid, a two-dimensional array that captures the distribution of discourse entities across text sentences.

The results on the Earthquakes and Accidents data are quite similar to those published in (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) (they reported 83.4% on Earthquakes and 89.7% on Accidents), validating the correctness of our reimplementation of their method. $$$$$ Evaluation results conclude the paper.

This result supports the use of salience, in line with the conclusion drawn in (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). $$$$$ This leaves only the coreference and salience information in the model, and the results are shown in Table 4 under (Coreference+Salience).
This result supports the use of salience, in line with the conclusion drawn in (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). $$$$$ Once this noise is removed (see Syntax+Salience), the salience model has a clear advantage over the other models.

The entity-based model of Barzilay and Lapata (2005) connects the local entity transition with textual coherence, while our model looks at the patterns of discourse relation transitions. $$$$$ Modeling Local Coherence

This intuition has been formalized by (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), who developed an entity-based statistical representation of local discourse and showed its usefulness for estimating coherence between sentences. $$$$$ In this section we introduce our entity-based representation of discourse.
This intuition has been formalized by (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), who developed an entity-based statistical representation of local discourse and showed its usefulness for estimating coherence between sentences. $$$$$ Some of these regularities are formalized in Centering Theory as constraints on transitions of local focus in adjacent sentences.

Barzilay and Lapata (2005) exploited the use of the distributional and referential information of discourse entities to improve summary coherence. $$$$$ The algorithm introduced in the paper automatically abstracts a text into a set of entity transition sequences, a representation that reflects distributional, syntactic, and referential information about discourse entities.
Barzilay and Lapata (2005) exploited the use of the distributional and referential information of discourse entities to improve summary coherence. $$$$$ Model performance was assessed in the same way for information ordering and summary evaluation.

In order to evaluate the local coherence of the reports generated by the system, we employed an automatic coherence evaluation method introduced by Barzilay and Lapata (2005). $$$$$ This paper considers the problem of automatic assessment of local coherence.
In order to evaluate the local coherence of the reports generated by the system, we employed an automatic coherence evaluation method introduced by Barzilay and Lapata (2005). $$$$$ In this section we describe two evaluation tasks that assess the merits of the coherence modeling framework introduced above.

Our model is inspired by Centering (Grosz et al, 1995) and other entity-based models of coherence (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) in which an entity is in focus through a sequence of sentences. $$$$$ This assumption is not arbitrary â€” some of these regularities have been recognized in Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and other entity-based theories of discourse.
Our model is inspired by Centering (Grosz et al, 1995) and other entity-based models of coherence (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) in which an entity is in focus through a sequence of sentences. $$$$$ Local coherence has been extensively studied within the modeling framework put forward by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Poesio et al., 2004; Kibble and Power, 2004).

We expect that features such as entity grid (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) will improve overall algorithm performance. $$$$$ Text structuring algorithms (Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Karamanis et al., 2004) are commonly evaluated by their performance at information-ordering.
We expect that features such as entity grid (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) will improve overall algorithm performance. $$$$$ However, we expect that the accuracy of a coherence model is reflected in its performance in the ordering task.

We present a model for discourse coherence which combines the local entity based approach of (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) and the HMM-based content model of (Barzilay and Lee, 2004). $$$$$ Modeling Local Coherence

As the local component of our model we adapt (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) by relaxing independence assumptions so that it is effective when estimated generatively. $$$$$ We view coherence assessment as a ranking learning problem and show that the proposed discourse representation supports the effective learning of a ranking function.
As the local component of our model we adapt (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) by relaxing independence assumptions so that it is effective when estimated generatively. $$$$$ One of the main assumptions underlying Centering is that a text segment which foregrounds a single entity is perceived to be more coherent than a segment in which multiple entities are discussed.

Moreover, an accurate model can reveal information about document structure, aiding in such tasks as supervised summarization (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). $$$$$ This is expected, since accurate identification of coreferring entities is prerequisite to deriving accurate salience models.
Moreover, an accurate model can reveal information about document structure, aiding in such tasks as supervised summarization (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005). $$$$$ In the discourse literature, entity-based theories are primarily applied at the level of local coherence, while relational models, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thomson, 1988; Marcu, 2000), are used to model the global structure of discourse.
