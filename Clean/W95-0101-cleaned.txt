(Brill, 1995) presents a rule-based part-of-speech tagger for unsupervised training corpus. $$$$$ Conclusions In this paper, we have presented a new algorithm for unsupervised training of a rule-based part of speech tagger.

The fact that observations and prior knowledge are useful for part-of-speech tagging is well understood (Brill, 1995), but the approach of estimating an initial transition model only from unambiguous word pairs is novel. $$$$$ If no prior knowledge is available, probabilities are initially either assigned randomly or evenly distributed.

In the meantime, (Brill 1995a) (Brill 1995b) proposed a method to acquire context-dependent POS disambiguation rules and created an accurate tagger, even from a very small annotated text by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. $$$$$ Unsupervised Learning Of Disambiguation Rules For Part Of Speech Tagging
In the meantime, (Brill 1995a) (Brill 1995b) proposed a method to acquire context-dependent POS disambiguation rules and created an accurate tagger, even from a very small annotated text by combining supervised and unsupervised learning. $$$$$ Next, we show a method for combining unsupervised and supervised rule-based training algorithms to create a highly accurate tagger using only a small amount of manually tagged text.

 $$$$$ The unsupervised rule learning algorithm is based on the following simple idea.
 $$$$$ We have also demonstrated that overtraining, a problem in Baum-Welch training, is not a problem in transformationbased learning.

Later results (e.g. Brill (1995)) seemed to indicate that other methods of unsupervised learning could be more effective (although the work of Banko and Moore (2004) suggests that the difference may be far less than previously assumed). $$$$$ In later learning iterations, the training set is transformed as a result of applying previously learned transformations.
Later results (e.g. Brill (1995)) seemed to indicate that other methods of unsupervised learning could be more effective (although the work of Banko and Moore (2004) suggests that the difference may be far less than previously assumed). $$$$$ These results are significantly lower than the results achieved using unsupervised transformation-based learning.

Transformation based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) is a machine learning approach for rule learning. $$$$$ The rule-based tagger is based on a learning algorithm called transformation-based errordriven learning.

In its most general setting, the TBL hypothesis is not a classifier (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ Transformation-based error-driven learning has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part of speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, speech generation and syntactic parsing [Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994; Roche and Schabes, 1995; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Huang et al., 1994; Brill, 1993a; Brill, 1993b].
In its most general setting, the TBL hypothesis is not a classifier (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ A transformation-based system is a processor and not a classifier.

(Brill, 1995) uses lexicon for initial annotation of the training corpus, where each word in the lexicon has a set POS tags seen for the word in the training corpus. $$$$$ The initial state annotator tags each word in the corpus with a list of all allowable tags.

We will also study the effect of other window sizes and the combination of this unsupervised approach with minimally-supervised approaches such as (Brill 1995) (Smith and Mann 2003). $$$$$ This approach is described in [Merialdo, 1995; Elworthy, 1994].

Research into unsupervised part-of-speech tagging with a tag dictionary (sometimes called weakly supervised POS tagging) has been going on for many years (cf Merialdo (1994), Brill (1995)), but generally using a fairly small tag set. $$$$$ Transformation-based error-driven learning has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part of speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, speech generation and syntactic parsing [Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994; Roche and Schabes, 1995; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Huang et al., 1994; Brill, 1993a; Brill, 1993b].

Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, as defined above, has been attempted using a variety of learning algorithms (Brill 1995, Church, 1988, Cutting et. al. 1992, Elworthy, 1994 Kupiec 1992, Merialdo 1991). $$$$$ Almost all of the work in the area of automatically trained taggers has explored Markov-model based part of speech tagging [Jelinek, 1985; Church, 1988; Derose, 1988; DeMarcken, 1990; Cutting et al., 1992; Kupiec, 1992; Charniak et al., 1993; Weischedel et al., 1993; Schutze and Singer, 1994; Lin et al., 1994; Elworthy, 1994; Merialdo, 19951.2 For a Markov-model based tagger, training consists of learning both lexical probabilities (P(worclItag)) and contextual probabilities (P(tagiltagi_i tagi_n)).

For our comparison of unsupervised tagging methods, we implemented the HMM taggers described in Merialdo (1991) and Kupiec (1992), as well as the UTBL tagger described in Brill (1995). $$$$$ In [Merialdo, 1995], tagging experiments are described training a tagger using the BaumWelch algorithm with a dictionary constructed as described above and an untagged corpus.
