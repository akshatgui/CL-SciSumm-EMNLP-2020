In byte-length ratio approaches, the presence of long stretches of blocks that have roughly similar lengths can be problematic, and some improvement can be achieved by augmenting the byte-length measure by scores derived from lexical feature matching (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ The introductory session header exemplifies a weakness of the pure length-based strategy, namely, its susceptibility to long stretches of passages with roughly similar lengths.
In byte-length ratio approaches, the presence of long stretches of blocks that have roughly similar lengths can be problematic, and some improvement can be achieved by augmenting the byte-length measure by scores derived from lexical feature matching (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ To obtain further improvement in alignment accuracy requires matching the passages' lexical content, rather than using pure length criteria.

For instance, the statistical correlation of sentence length between English and Chinese is not as high as that between two Indo European languages (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ In summary, we have found that the statistical correlation of sentence lengths has a far greater variance for our English-Chinese materials than with the Indo-European materials used by Gale & Church (1991).
For instance, the statistical correlation of sentence length between English and Chinese is not as high as that between two Indo European languages (Wu, 1994). $$$$$ To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale empirical demonstration that a pure length-based method can yield high accuracy sentence alignments between parallel texts in Indo-European and entirely dissimilar non-alphabetic, non-IndoEuropean languages.

As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ 1993).
As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ If translated sentences share cognates, then the character lengths of those cognates are of course correlated.

There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment $$$$$ 1991; Chen 1993), and coarser approaches when sentences are difficult to identify have also been advanced (Church 1993; Dagan el at.

The first sentence alignment model used to align English-Chinese bilingual texts is proposed by Wu (1994). $$$$$ We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts.
The first sentence alignment model used to align English-Chinese bilingual texts is proposed by Wu (1994). $$$$$ Also, (11, 12) shows an example of a 3-for-1, 1-for-1 sequence that the model has no choice but to align as 2-for-2, 2-for-2.

We use parts of the HKUST English-Chinese Bilingual Corpora for our experiments (Wu 1994), consisting of transcriptions of the Hong Kong Legislative Council debates in both English and Chinese. $$$$$ In the first of the following sections, we describe the objectives of the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, and our progress.

Work on sentence alignment of English and Chinese texts (Wu 1994), indicates that the lengths of English and Chinese texts are not as highly correlated as in French-English task, leading to lower success rate (85-94%) for length-based aligners. $$$$$ We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts.

The approaches by (Wu, 1994), (Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996), (Ma, 2006) and (Gautam and Sinha, 2007) require an externally supplied bilingual lexicon. $$$$$ Approaches to alignment fall into two main classes

Wu (Wu, 1994) also used lexical cues from corpus-specific bilingual lexicon for better alignment. $$$$$ Our report concerns three related topics

Existing parallel corpora have illustrated their particular value in empirical NLP research, e.g., Canadian Hansard Corpus (Gale and Church, 1991b), HK Hansard (Wu, 1994), INTERSECT (Salkie, 1995), ENPC (Ebeling, 1998), the Bible parallel corpus (Resnik et al, 1999) and many others. $$$$$ Recently, a number of automatic techniques for aligning sentences in parallel bilingual corpora have been proposed (Kay & ROscheisen 1988; Catizone et al. 1989; Gale & Church 1991; Brown et at.

All experiments reported in this paper were performed on sentence-pairs from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, which consists of governmental transcripts (Wu 1994). $$$$$ In this paper, we describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts, which was performed as part of the SILC machine translation project.

 $$$$$ The first commonly made approximation is that the probabilities of the individual aligned pairs within an alignment are independent, i.e., The other common approximation is that each Pr(Li L2171 , 7-2) depends not on the entire texts, but only on the contents of the specific passages within the alignment

Previous studies such as (Fung and Wu, 1994) have commented 268 that methods developed for Indo-European language pairs using alphabetic haracters have not addressed important issues which occur with European-Asian language pairs. $$$$$ However, as far as we know, the literature on automatic alignment has been restricted to alphabetic Indo-European languages.

It has also been suggested by (Wu, 1994) that sentence length ratio correlations may arise partly out of historic cognate-based relationships between Indo-European languages. $$$$$ The dearth of work on non-Indo-European languages can partly be attributed to a lack of the prequisite bilingual corpora.
It has also been suggested by (Wu, 1994) that sentence length ratio correlations may arise partly out of historic cognate-based relationships between Indo-European languages. $$$$$ Although it has been suggested that lengthbased methods are language-independent (Gale Sz Church 1991; Brown et al. 1991), they may in fact rely to some extent on length correlations arising from the historical relationships of the languages being aligned.

(Wu, 1994), about whether the byte length model by itself can perform well. $$$$$ Gale & Church's (1991) length-based alignment method is based on the model that each English character in L1 is responsible for generating some number of characters in L2.
(Wu, 1994), about whether the byte length model by itself can perform well. $$$$$ To do this we look at the relation between /1 and 12 under the generative model.
