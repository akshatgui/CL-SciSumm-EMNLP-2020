(Carpuat and Wu, 2007) report an improvement in translation quality by incorporating a WSD system directly in a phrase-based translation system. $$$$$ Rather, it has beenargued, SMT systems have managed to achieve sig nificant improvements in translation quality without directly addressing translation disambiguation as aWSD task.
(Carpuat and Wu, 2007) report an improvement in translation quality by incorporating a WSD system directly in a phrase-based translation system. $$$$$ We then show that incorporating it into a standard phrase-based SMT baseline system consistently improves translation quality across all three different test sets from the Chinese-English IWSLT text translation evaluation,as well as on the larger NIST Chinese-English trans lation task.

The output of this model is incorporated into the machine translation system by providing the WSD probabilities for a phrase translation as extra features in a log-linear model (Carpuat and Wu, 2007). $$$$$ The single-word model has the disad vantage of forcing the decoder to choose between the baseline phrasal translation probabilities versusthe WSD model predictions for single words.

(Chan and Ng, 2007) introduce a system very similar to that of (Carpuat and Wu, 2007), but as applied to hierarchical phrase-based translation. $$$$$ The main differencebetween this approach and several of our earlier ap proaches as described in Carpuat and Wu (2005b) and subsequently Carpuat et al (2006) lies in the fact that we focus on repurposing the WSD systemfor multi-word phrase-based SMT.

Another WSD approach incorporating context-dependent phrasal translation lexicons is given in (Carpuatand Wu, 2007) and has been evaluated on several translation tasks. $$$$$ Garcia Varea et al found that the best results are obtained when the training of the context-dependent translation model is fully incorporated with the EM training of the SMT system.
Another WSD approach incorporating context-dependent phrasal translation lexicons is given in (Carpuatand Wu, 2007) and has been evaluated on several translation tasks. $$$$$ It is therefore necessary for the WSD and SMT systems to consider exactly the same translation candidates for a given word in the input language.

In Chan and Ng (2007) a classifier exploits information such as local collocations, parts-of-speech or surrounding words to determine the lexical choice of target words, while Carpuat and Wu (2007) use rich context features based on position, syntax and local collocations to dynamically adapt the lexicons for each sentence and facilitate the choice of longer phrases. $$$$$ The target words for both categories of Sen seval WSD tasks are typically only content words?
