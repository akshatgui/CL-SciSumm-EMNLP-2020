Chiang (2010) also obtained significant improvement over his hierarchical baseline by using syntactic parse trees on both source and target sides to induce fuzzy (not exact) tree-to-tree rules and by also allowing syntactically mismatched substitutions. $$$$$ Using exact tree-to-tree extraction, we got a much smaller grammar, but decreased accuracy on all but the Chinese-English test set, where there was no significant change.

Chiang (2010) also avoided hard constraints and took a soft alternative that directly models the cost of mismatched rule substitutions. $$$$$ We then took a closer look at the behavior of the string-to-string and fuzzy tree-to-tree grammars (without the nesting heuristic).
Chiang (2010) also avoided hard constraints and took a soft alternative that directly models the cost of mismatched rule substitutions. $$$$$ First, Table 4 shows that the system using the tree-to-tree grammar used the glue rule much less and performed more matching substitutions.

 $$$$$ Fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction (like string-to-string extraction) generates many times more rules than exact tree-to-tree extraction does.

SAMT extension with source and target-side syntax described by Chiang (2010). $$$$$ Learning to Translate with Source and Target Syntax
SAMT extension with source and target-side syntax described by Chiang (2010). $$$$$ In this paper, we explore the reasons why treeto-tree translation has been challenging, and how source syntax and target syntax might be used together.

In future work, the problem could be addressed by reconsidering our naming scheme for virtual nodes, by allowing fuzzy matching of labels at translation time (Chiang, 2010), or by other techniques aimed at reducing the size of the overall nonterminal set. $$$$$ Any STSSG can be converted into an equivalent STSG via the creation of virtual nodes (see Figure 3b)

Although MT systems that employ syntactic or hierarchical information have recently shown improvements over phrase-based approaches (Chiang, 2010), our initial investigation with syntactically driven approaches showed poorer performance on the text simplification task and were less robust to noise in the training data. $$$$$ For this reason, some approaches work with a more flexible notion of constituency.
Although MT systems that employ syntactic or hierarchical information have recently shown improvements over phrase-based approaches (Chiang, 2010), our initial investigation with syntactically driven approaches showed poorer performance on the text simplification task and were less robust to noise in the training data. $$$$$ The systems were trained using MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Chiang et al., 2009) on a tuning set of about 3000 sentences of newswire from NIST MT evaluation data and GALE development data, disjoint from the training data.

The string-to-tree (Galleyet al 2006) and tree-to-tree (Chiang, 2010) methods have also been the subject of experimentation, as well as other formalisms such as Dependency Trees (Shen et al, 2008). $$$$$ The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).
The string-to-tree (Galleyet al 2006) and tree-to-tree (Chiang, 2010) methods have also been the subject of experimentation, as well as other formalisms such as Dependency Trees (Shen et al, 2008). $$$$$ Drawing on previous successful attempts to relax syntactic constraints during grammar extraction in various ways (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006), we compare several methods for extracting a synchronous grammar from tree-to-tree data.

The reported results show that while utilizing linguistic information helps, the coverage is more important (Chiang, 2010). $$$$$ These models make use of varying amounts of information from linguistic theory

Chiang (2010) extended SAMT-style labels to both source and target-side parses, also introducing a mechanism by which SCFG rules may apply at runtime even if their labels do not match. $$$$$ We might think of it as effectively restructuring the trees by inserting nodes with complex labels.
Chiang (2010) extended SAMT-style labels to both source and target-side parses, also introducing a mechanism by which SCFG rules may apply at runtime even if their labels do not match. $$$$$ In the exact tree-to-tree approach, whenever substitution is performed, the root labels of the substituted trees must match the labels of the substitution nodes—call this the matching constraint.

However, as discussed by Chiang (2010), while tree-to-tree translation is indeed promising in theory, in practice it usually ends up over-constrained. $$$$$ In other words, exact tree-to-tree extraction commits to a single structural analysis but fuzzy tree-to-tree extraction pursues many restructured analyses at once.

Inspired by Chiang (2010), we adopt a fuzzy way to label every source string with the complex syntactic categories of SAMT (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006). $$$$$ The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).
Inspired by Chiang (2010), we adopt a fuzzy way to label every source string with the complex syntactic categories of SAMT (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006). $$$$$ Because the rules of these grammars are in one-to-one correspondence, we can analyze the string-to-string system’s derivations as though they had syntactic categories.

However, as noted by Lavie et al. (2008), Liu et al. (2009), and Chiang (2010), the integration of syntactic information on both sides tends to decrease translation quality because the systems be come too restrictive. $$$$$ The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).

(2009), and Chiang (2010), the integration of syntactic information on both sides tends to decrease translation quality because the systems be come too restrictive. $$$$$ But the natural generalization to this setting has been found to underperform phrasebased models (Liu et al., 2009; Ambati and Lavie, 2008), and researchers have begun to explore solutions (Zhang et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009).

Fuzzy constituency constraints can solve this problem with a combination of product categories and slash categories (Chiang, 2010). $$$$$ One confounding factor in such a comparison is that some methods generate many new syntactic categories, making it more difficult to satisfy syntactic constraints at decoding time.

Using both source and target syntax, but relaxing on rule extraction and substitution enables HPBMT to produce more well-formed and syntactically richer derivations (Chiang, 2010). $$$$$ That is, in order to minimize errors on the tuning set, the model learned to build syntactically richer and more well-formed derivations.
Using both source and target syntax, but relaxing on rule extraction and substitution enables HPBMT to produce more well-formed and syntactically richer derivations (Chiang, 2010). $$$$$ Indeed, we have found that the model learns on its own to choose syntactically richer and more wellformed structures, demonstrating that source- and target-side syntax can be used together profitably as long as they are not allowed to overconstrain the translation model.

Tellingly, in the entire proceedings of ACL 2010 (Hajic et al., 2010), only one paper describing a statistical MT system cited the use of MIRA for tuning (Chiang, 2010), while 15 used MERT. $$$$$ The simplest of these (Chiang, 2005) make no use of information from syntactic theories or syntactic annotations, whereas others have successfully incorporated syntactic information on the target side (Galley et al., 2004; Galley et al., 2006) or the source side (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).
