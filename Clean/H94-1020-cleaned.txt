Few hand-crafted, deep unification grammars have in fact achieved the coverage and robustness required to parse a corpus of say the size and complexity of the Penn treebank: (Riezler et al., 2002) show how a deep, carefully hand-crafted LFG is successfully scaled to parse the Penn-II treebank (Marcus et al, 1994) with discriminative (log linear) parameter estimation techniques. $$$$$ hand-retagged using the Penn Treebank tagset.

Figure 1: The tree structure for an imperative sentence part-of-speech is the WP in Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1994) POS tag set) or is an adverb (WRB). $$$$$ We have adopted the set of functional tags shown in Figure 2 for use within the current annotation scheme.
Figure 1: The tree structure for an imperative sentence part-of-speech is the WP in Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1994) POS tag set) or is an adverb (WRB). $$$$$ Either the adverb is trapped within the VP, so that the complement can occur within the VP, where it belongs, or else the adverb is at- tached to the S, closing off the VP and forcing the comple- ment to attach to the S. This "trapping" problem serves as a limitation for groups that currently use Treebank material to semiautomatically derive lexicons for particular applications.

We will be reporting on results using PropBank (Kingsbury et al, 2002), a 300k-word corpus in which predicate argument relations are marked for part of the verbs in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al, 1994). $$$$$ We have now begun to annotate this level of structure diting the present Penn Treebank; we intend to automatically ex- tract a bank of predicate-argument structures intended at the very least for parser evaluation from the resulting annotated corpus.

This results in several aspects that distinguish the MH treebank from, e.g., the WSJ Penn tree bank annotation scheme (Marcus et al, 1994). $$$$$ This paper discusses the implementation of crucial aspects of this new annotation scheme.

Also, the MH tree bank is much smaller than the ones for, e.g., English (Marcus et al, 1994) and Arabic (Maamouri and Bies, 2004), making it hard to apply data-intensive methods such as the all subtrees approach (Bod, 1992) or full lexicalization (Collins, 2003). $$$$$ Brill, E., Marcus, M., 1992.

The PennTreebank II (Marcus et al, 1994) marks subjects (SBJ), logical objects of passives (LGS), some reduced relative clauses (RRC), as well as other grammatical information, but does not mark each constituent with a grammatical role. $$$$$ The logical sub- ject by-phrase, if present, is a child of VP, and is tagged -LGS (LoGical Subject).

The same idea was used by Magerman (1995), who developed the first "head table" for the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1994), and Collins (1996), whose constituent parser is internally based on probabilities of bilexical dependencies, i.e. dependencies between two words. $$$$$ Some would also like a less skeletal form of anno- tation, expanding the essentially context-free analysis of the current treebank to indicate non-contiguous structures and dependencies.
