Document structure (WD) is another important clue in determining which elements of a text are important enough to include in a summary (Marcu, 1997). $$$$$ The most important units of a textual span are determined recursively: they correspond to the most important units of the immediate subspans when the relation that holds between these subspans is paratactic, and to the most important units of the nucleus subspan when the relation that holds between the immediate subspans is hypotactic.
Document structure (WD) is another important clue in determining which elements of a text are important enough to include in a summary (Marcu, 1997). $$$$$ For example, relation rhet_re/(ELABoRATIoN, 3, 1) will be ruled out because unit 1 is not an important unit for span [1,2] and, as mentioned at the beginning of this section, a rhetorical relation that holds between two spans of a valid text structure must also hold between their most important units: the important unit of span [1,2] is unit 2, i.e., the nucleus of the relation r het fel(cONCESSION , 1,2).

Most recently, Marcu (1997) has described a method for text summarization based on nuclearity and selective retention of hierarchical fragments. $$$$$ The algorithms described in this paper rely on the results derived from the analysis of 1600 of the 7900 text fragments.

Since discourse markers, such as because and and, have been shown to play a major role in rhetorical parsing (Marcu, 1997), we also consider a list of features that specify whether a lexeme found within the local contextual window is a potential discourse marker. $$$$$ The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first-order formalization of valid text structures (Marcu, 1997).

Argumentation belongs to discourse analysis, with fairly complex computational models such as the implementation of the rhetorical structure theory proposed by (Marcu, 1997), which proposes dozens of rhetorical classes. $$$$$ Relations can be partitioned into two classes: paratactic and hypotactic.

Marcu (1997) describes a rhetorical parsing approach which takes unrestricted text as input and derives the rhetorical structure tree. $$$$$ The Rhetorical Parsing Of Unrestricted Natural Language Texts
Marcu (1997) describes a rhetorical parsing approach which takes unrestricted text as input and derives the rhetorical structure tree. $$$$$ The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first-order formalization of valid text structures (Marcu, 1997).

Our segmentation is linear, rather than hierarchical (Marcu 1997 and Yaari 1997), i.e. the input article is divided into a linear sequence of adjacent segments. $$$$$ Researchers of natural language have repeatedly acknowledged that texts are not just a sequence of words nor even a sequence of clauses and sentences.

Considering the problem from another angle, discourse approaches have focused on shorter units than multi-paragraph segments, but Rhetorical Structure Theory (Marcu 1997 and others) may be able to scale up to associate rhetorical functions with segments. $$$$$ In our previous work (Marcu, 1996), we presented a complete axiomatization of these principles in the context of Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and we described an algorithm that, starting from the set of textual units that make up a text and the set of elementary rhetorical relations that hold between these units, can derive all the valid discourse trees of that text.
Considering the problem from another angle, discourse approaches have focused on shorter units than multi-paragraph segments, but Rhetorical Structure Theory (Marcu 1997 and others) may be able to scale up to associate rhetorical functions with segments. $$$$$ The intuition behind our choice relies on the following facts: the discourse segments that they relate.

In the approach proposed in (Marcu, 1997), for example, the presence of discourse markers is used to hypothesize individual textual units and relations holding between them. $$$$$ Once the textual units are determined, the rhetorical parser uses the procedures derived from the corpus analysis to hypothesize rhetorical relations between the textual units.
In the approach proposed in (Marcu, 1997), for example, the presence of discourse markers is used to hypothesize individual textual units and relations holding between them. $$$$$ We also expect that other robust methods for determining coherence relations between textual units, such as those described by Harabagiu and Moldovan (1995), will improve the accuracy of the routines that hypothesize the rhetorical relations that hold between adjacent units.

Marcu (1997) parsed documents as rhetorical trees and identified important sentences based on the trees. $$$$$ We derive the rhetorical structures of texts by means of two new, surface-form-based algorithms: one that identifies discourse usages of cue phrases and breaks sentences into clauses, and one that produces valid rhetorical structure trees for unrestricted natural language texts.
