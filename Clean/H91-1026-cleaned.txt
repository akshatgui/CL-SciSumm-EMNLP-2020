Motivated by the need to reduce on the memory requirement and to insure robustness in estimation of probability, Gale and Church (1991) proposed an alternative algorithm in which probabilities are not estimated and stored for all word pairs. $$$$$ We decided to look for an alternative estimation algorithm for two reasons.

When trained with a corpus only one-tenth the size of the corpus used in Gale and Church (1991), the algorithm aligns over 80% of word pairs with comparable precision (93%). $$$$$ In particular, the corpus could be used to develop and test sense- disambiguation algorithms.

These methods often involve using a statistic such as ?2 (Gale and Church, 1991) or the log likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) to create a score to measure the strength of correlation between source and target words. $$$$$ In other words, we favor methods with relatively high 1.

We produce an initial alignment using the same algorithm described in Section 3, except we maximize summed phi2 link scores (Gale and Church, 1991), rather than alignment probability. $$$$$ There has been quite a bit of recent work on sentence alignment, e.g., (Brown, Lai and Mercer, 1990, (Kay and Rbscheisen, 1988), (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick, to appear); we use a method described in (Gale and Church, 1991) which makes use of the fact that the length of a text (in characters) i~ 5ighly correlated (0.991) with the length of its translation.

Existing parallel corpora have illustrated their particular value in empirical NLP research, e.g., Canadian Hansard Corpus (Gale and Church, 1991b), HK Hansard (Wu, 1994), INTERSECT (Salkie, 1995), ENPC (Ebeling, 1998), the Bible parallel corpus (Resnik et al, 1999) and many others. $$$$$ Identifying Word Correspondences in Parallel Texts William A.

The first cost function is the correlation measure (cf the use of phi2 in Gale and Church (1991)) computed as follows:= (bc ad )x/ (a+ b) (c+ d) (a+ c) (b+ d) where a =nv -n~, i~v b =nw, y c= Nnvnw +nw, v d =nwnw, v N is the total number of bi texts, nv the number of bi texts in which V appears in the target, nw the number of bi texts in which W appears in the source, and nw, y the number of bi texts in which W appears in the source and V appears in the target. $$$$$ First, their procedure appears to require a prohibitive amount of memory.

A wide variety of ways of LTP estimation have been proposed in the literature of computational linguistics, including Dice coefficient (Kay and Roscheisen 1993), mutual information, phi2 (Gale and Church 1991b), dictionary and thesaurus Table 1. $$$$$ Note that mutual information does not distinguish these two pairs.

Gale and Church (1991) made what may be the first application of word association to word alignment. $$$$$ Based on a sample of 800 sentences, we estimate that our word matching procedure matches 61% of the English words with some French word, and about 95% of these pairs match the English word with the appropriate French word.

The algorithm creates an initial alignment using search, constraints, and summed phi2 correlation-based scores (Gale and Church, 1991). $$$$$ We wish to distinguish the terms alignment and correspondence, The term alignment will be used when order constraints must be preserved and the term correspondence will be used when order constraints need not be preserved and crossing dependencies are permitted.

In this work, the sentence level alignment algorithm given in (Gale and Church,1991) has been used for applying segment constraint. $$$$$ In contrast, we refer to the matching problem at the sentence level as an alignment problem because we believe that it is not necessary to model crossing dependencies at the sentence l vel as they are quite rare and can be ignored for now.
