Karttunen (1984) provides examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful. $$$$$ Another useful operation on feature matrices is generalization.
Karttunen (1984) provides examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful. $$$$$ The system of articles in German provides many examples that call for disjunctive feature specifications.

One example of the gap between description and computational implementation is disjunctive feature representation, which became popular in feature-based grammar formalisms in the 1980s (Karttunen, 1984). $$$$$ Several related grammar formalisms (UG, LFG, PATHII, and GPS() now exist that are based on a very similar conception of features and use unification as their basic operation.

The feature structure (adopted from Karttunen, 1984, p. 30) represents disjunctions by enclosing the alternatives in curly brackets ({}). $$$$$ We indicate disjunction by enclosing the alternative values in {}.
The feature structure (adopted from Karttunen, 1984, p. 30) represents disjunctions by enclosing the alternatives in curly brackets ({}). $$$$$ Because there is no basis for choosing one, both alternatives have to be left open.
