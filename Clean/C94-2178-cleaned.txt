However, Fung and Church (1994) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English. $$$$$ It remains an open question how well these methods might generalize to other language pairs, especially pairs such as English-Japanese and English- Chinese.
However, Fung and Church (1994) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English. $$$$$ Currently, word_align depends on charalign (Church, 1993) to generate a starting point, which limits its applicability to European languages since char_align was designed for language pairs that share a common alphabet.

As Fung and Church (1994) we wish to estimate the bilingual lexicon directly. $$$$$ Some of these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as a by-product.

 $$$$$ Thus, we denote the distribution of fisheries in the English text with a K-dimensional binary vector, VU, and similarly, we denote the distribution of p~ches in the French text with a K-dimensional binary vector, Vp.
