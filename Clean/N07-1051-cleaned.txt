For preprocessing, all the sentences in the Bioscope corpus are tokenized and then parsed using the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) trained on the GENIA TreeBank (GTB) 1.0 (Tateisi et al, 2005), which is a bracketed corpus in (almost) PTB style. $$$$$ 2 using the parser of Petrov et al.

On standard evaluations using both the Penn Tree bank and the Penn Chinese Treebank, our parser gave higher accuracies than the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), a state-of-the-art chart parser. $$$$$ Empirically, the gains on the English Penn treebank level off after 6 rounds.

The Berkeley and BUBS parsers both parse with the Berkeley latent-variable grammar (Petrov and Klein, 2007b), while the Charniak parser uses a lexicalized grammar, and the exhaustive CKY algorithm is run with a simple Markov order-2 grammar. $$$$$ We consider PCFG grammars which are derived from a raw treebank as in Petrov et al.

These are precisely the kinds of distinctions between determiners that state-splitting in the Berkeley parser has shown to be useful (Petrov and Klein, 2007), and existing work (Mikolov et al., 2013b) has observed that such regular embedding structure extends to many other parts of speech. $$$$$ Previous work has shown that high-quality unlexicalized PCFGs can be learned from a treebank, either by manual annotation (Klein and Manning, 2003) or automatic state splitting (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

This process not only guarantees that the clusters are hierarchical, it also avoids the state drift discussed by Petrov and Klein (2007). $$$$$ Some of our methods and conclusions are relevant to all state-split grammars, such as Klein and Manning (2003) or Dreyer and Eisner (2006), while others apply most directly to the hierarchical case.
