The Berkeley and BUBS parsers both parse with the Berkeley latent-variable grammar (Petrov and Klein, 2007b), while the Charniak parser uses a lexicalized grammar, and the exhaustive CKY algorithm is run with a simple Markov order-2 grammar. $$$$$ We consider PCFG grammars which are derived from a raw treebank as in Petrov et al. (2006): A simple X-bar grammar is created by binarizing the treebank trees.

These are precisely the kinds of distinctions between determiners that state-splitting in the Berkeley parser has shown to be useful (Petrov and Klein, 2007), and existing work (Mikolov et al., 2013b) has observed that such regular embedding structure extends to many other parts of speech. $$$$$ Previous work has shown that high-quality unlexicalized PCFGs can be learned from a treebank, either by manual annotation (Klein and Manning, 2003) or automatic state splitting (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

For this work, we have re-implemented and enhanced the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein 2007) in several ways: (1) developed a new method to handle rare words in English and Chinese; (2) developed a new model of unknown Chinese words based on characters in the word; (3) increased robustness by adding adaptive modification of pruning thresholds and smoothing of word emission probabilities. $$$$$ The contributions of our method are that we derive sequences of refinements in a new way (Sec.

This process not only guarantees that the clusters are hierarchical, it also avoids the state drift discussed by Petrov and Klein (2007). $$$$$ Some of our methods and conclusions are relevant to all state-split grammars, such as Klein and Manning (2003) or Dreyer and Eisner (2006), while others apply most directly to the hierarchical case.
