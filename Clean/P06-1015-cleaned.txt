Here we used the Tchai algorithm (Komachi and Suzuki, 2008), a modified version of Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) to collect such candidates. $$$$$ For our tokenization, in order to harvest multiword terms as relation instances, we adopt a slightly modified version of the term definition given in (Justeson 1995), as it is one of the most commonly used in the NLP literature

In the pattern induction step (section 3.2 in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006a)), Espresso computes a reliability score for each candidate pattern based on the weighted PMI of the pattern with all instances extracted so far. $$$$$ Espresso iterates between the following three phases

Others have used classifications based on the requirements for a specific task, such as Information Extraction (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) or biomedical applications (Stephens et al, 2001). $$$$$ Other pattern-based algorithms include (Riloff and Shepherd 1997), who used a semi-automatic method for discovering similar words using a few seed examples, KnowItAll (Etzioni et al. 2005) that performs large-scale extraction of facts from the Web, Mann (2002) who used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of is-a relations involving proper nouns, and (Downey et al.

In our study, we use point wise mutual information (Cover and Thomas, 1991) to measure association strength, which has been proved effective in the task of semantic relation identification (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006). $$$$$ This study is the first extensive attempt to make use of generic patterns.
