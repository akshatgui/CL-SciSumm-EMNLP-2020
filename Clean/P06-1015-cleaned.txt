In the pattern induction step (section 3.2 in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006a)), Espresso computes a reliability score for each candidate pattern based on the weighted PMI of the pattern with all instances extracted so far. $$$$$ Espresso iterates between the following three phases: pattern induction, pattern ranking/selection, and instance extraction.
In the pattern induction step (section 3.2 in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006a)), Espresso computes a reliability score for each candidate pattern based on the weighted PMI of the pattern with all instances extracted so far. $$$$$ Hence, analogous to our pattern reliability measure, we define the reliability of an instance i, rι(i), as: where rπ(p) is the reliability of pattern p (defined earlier) and maxpmi is as before.
