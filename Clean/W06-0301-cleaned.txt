Due to data sparseness, Kim and Hovy (2006) expand FrameNet data by using an unsupervised clustering algorithm. $$$$$ Data

Kim and Hovy (2006 ) used a FrameNet-based semantic role labeler to deter mine holder and topic of opinions. $$$$$ This method uses semantic role labeling as an intermediate step to label an opinion holder and topic using data from FrameNet.

Kim and Hovy (2006) use structural features of the language to identify opinion entities. $$$$$ We first identify an opinion and then find its holder and topic.

A more linguistically motivated approach was taken by Kim and Hovy (2006) through identifying opinion holders and targets with semantic role labeling. $$$$$ Semantic role labeling is the task of identifying semantic roles such as Agent, Patient, Speaker, or Topic, in a sentence.

Also Framenet (Ruppenhofer et al (2010)) is used as a resource in opinion mining and sentiment analysis (Kim and Hovy (2006)). $$$$$ Sentiment detection is the task of determining positive or negative sentiment of words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), phrases and sentences (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005), or documents (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002).

 $$$$$ Note that in our study we treat word sentiment classification as a three-way classification problem instead of a two-way classification problem (i.e. positive and negative).
 $$$$$ Also, it would be interesting to see how other types of part of speech such as adverbs and nouns affect the performance of the system.

Kim and Hovy (2006) identifies opinion holders and targets by using their semantic roles related to opinion words. $$$$$ We decompose our task into three phases

Some work such as (Kim and Hovy, 2006) has explored the connection to role labeling. $$$$$ This paper is organized as follows

Kim and Hovy (2006) use a machine translation system and subsequently use a subjectivity analysis system that was developed for English. $$$$$ Both of them use the MPQA corpus2 but they only identify opinion holders, not topics.
Kim and Hovy (2006) use a machine translation system and subsequently use a subjectivity analysis system that was developed for English. $$$$$ Words in the positive class carry positive valence whereas 4 These were randomly selected from 8011 English verbs and 19748 English adjectives. those in negative class carry negative valence.

A notable exception is the work of Kim and Hovy (2006). $$$$$ Building on this work, more sophisticated problems such as opinion holder identification have also been studied.
A notable exception is the work of Kim and Hovy (2006). $$$$$ Their work is similar to ours but different because their opinion is restricted to propositional opinion and mostly to verbs.

Opinion holder is usually an entity that holds an opinion, and opinion target is what the opinion is about (Kim and Hovy, 2006). $$$$$ We first identify an opinion and then find its holder and topic.
Opinion holder is usually an entity that holds an opinion, and opinion target is what the opinion is about (Kim and Hovy, 2006). $$$$$ We define holder as an entity who holds an opinion, and topic, as what the opinion is about.

Kim and Hovy (2006) proposed to map the semantic frames of FrameNet into opinion holder and target for only adjectives and verbs. $$$$$ 49 frames for verbs and 43 frames for adjectives are collected.

This means that we are actually searching for all triples{ source, target, opinion} in this sentence (Kim and Hovy, 2006) and throughout each document in the corpus. $$$$$ We collected frames related to opinion words from the FrameNet corpus.

Bethard et al (2004) use this resource to acquire labeled training data while in (Kim and Hovy, 2006) FrameNet is used within a rule-based classifier mapping frame-elements of frames to opinion holders. $$$$$ To achieve this goal, we utilize FrameNet data by mapping target words to opinion-bearing words and mapping semantic roles to holders and topics, and then use them for system training.
