Paper will be implemented in ICONOCLAST, an authoring tool which enables domain experts to create a knowledge base through a sequence of interactive choice and generates hiexarchitally structured text according to various tylistic constraints (See Power and Scott 1998). $$$$$ These projects were the first attempts to produce symbolic authoring systems - that is, systems allowing a domain expert with no training in knowledge engineering to author a knowledge base (or symbolic source) from which texts in many languages can be generated.

One important source of inspiration for GF was the WYSIWYM system (Power and Scott 1998), which used domain-specific interlinguas and produced excellent quality in multilingual generation. $$$$$ Two approaches have been adopted

Figure 1 $$$$$ We have called this editing method `WYSIWYM', or 'What You See Is What You Meant'

The MDA (Multilingual Document Authoring) system [Brun et al2000] is an instance (descended from Ranta's Grammatical Framework [Ranta 2002]) of a text-mediated interactive natural language generation system, a notion introduced by [Power and Scott 1998] under the name of WYSIWYM. $$$$$ Two approaches have been adopted

querying Conceptual authoring through WYSIWYM editing alleviates the need for expensive syntactic and semantic processing of the queries by providing the users with an interface for editing the conceptual meaning of a query instead of the surface text (Power and Scott, 1998). $$$$$ For MT, information extraction is a major difficulty, since the meaning must be derived by analysis of the source text; M-NLG avoids this difficulty but seems at first sight to require an expensive phase of knowledge engineering in order to encode the meaning.
querying Conceptual authoring through WYSIWYM editing alleviates the need for expensive syntactic and semantic processing of the queries by providing the users with an interface for editing the conceptual meaning of a query instead of the surface text (Power and Scott, 1998). $$$$$ When supported by a multilingual natural language generation system, as in DRAFTER-II, WYSIWYM editing obviates the need for traditional language localisation of the human-computer interface.

The "WYSIWYM" approach was proposed ([Power and Scott, 1998], [Paris and Vander Linden, 1996]) as a system design methodology where users author and manipulate an underlying logical form through a user interface that provides feedback in natural language text. $$$$$ This approach has also been adopted in two M-NLG systems

In an influential series of papers [Power and Scott, 1998], WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) was proposed as a method for the authoring of semantic information through direct manipulation of structures rendered in natural language text. $$$$$ Some knowledge management projects have experimented with graphical presentations which allow editing by direct manipulation, so that there is no need to learn the syntax of a programming language see for example Skuce and Lethbridge (1995).

The system belongs to the family of WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) (Power and Scott, 1998) text generation systems $$$$$ This approach has also been adopted in two M-NLG systems

The method was invented to meet the needs of applications using WYSIWYM editing (Power and Scott, 1998), which allow an author to control the content of an automatically generated text without prior training in knowledge engineering. $$$$$ These projects were the first attempts to produce symbolic authoring systems - that is, systems allowing a domain expert with no training in knowledge engineering to author a knowledge base (or symbolic source) from which texts in many languages can be generated.

Wysiwym (What You See Is What You Meant) is a user-interface technology through which a domain expert can formally encode knowledge by structured editing of an automatically generated feedback text (Power and Scott, 1998). $$$$$ Assuming that some kind of mediation is needed between domain expert and knowledge formalism, the only alternative is to provide easier tools for editing knowledge bases.
