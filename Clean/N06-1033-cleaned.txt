For arbitrary SCFGs, this is typically accomplished via the synchronous binarization technique of (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ In particular: • We develop a technique called synchronous binarization and devise a fast binarization algorithm such that the resulting rule set allows efficient algorithms for both synchronous parsing and decoding with integrated n-gram language models.

We show that this approach gives us better practical performance than a mature system that binarizes using the technique of (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ This larger locality is linguistically motivated and leads to a better parameter estimation.
We show that this approach gives us better practical performance than a mature system that binarizes using the technique of (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ Our rule set is obtained by first doing word alignment using GIZA++ on a Chinese-English parallel corpus containing 50 million words in English, then parsing the English sentences using a variant of Collins parser, and finally extracting rules using the graph-theoretic algorithm of Galley et al. (2004).

For SCFG grammars, (Zhang et al, 2006) provide a scope reduction method called synchronous binarization with quantifiable loss. $$$$$ In particular: • We develop a technique called synchronous binarization and devise a fast binarization algorithm such that the resulting rule set allows efficient algorithms for both synchronous parsing and decoding with integrated n-gram language models.

Their principal objective is to provide a scope reduction method for SCFG that introduces fewer postconditions than (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ • We examine the effect of this binarization method on end-to-end machine translation quality, compared to a more typical baseline method.

Synchronous binarization (Zhang et al, 2006) solves this problem by simultaneously binarizing both source and target-sides of a synchronous rule, making sure of contiguous spans on both sides whenever possible. $$$$$ Figure 2 suggests that a binarization is good if every virtual nonterminal has contiguous spans on both sides.

Intuitively speaking, the gaps on the target-side will lead to exponential complexity in decoding with integrated language models (see Section 3), as well as synchronous parsing (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ In this framework, both alignment (synchronous parsing) and decoding can be thought of as parsing problems, whose complexity is in general exponential in the number of nonterminals on the right hand side of a grammar rule.
Intuitively speaking, the gaps on the target-side will lead to exponential complexity in decoding with integrated language models (see Section 3), as well as synchronous parsing (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ In the case of m-gram integrated decoding, we have to maintain 2(m − 1) boundary words for each child nonterminal, which leads to a prohibitive overall complexity of O(

This representation, being contiguous on both sides, successfully reduces the decoding complexity to a low polynomial and significantly improved the search quality (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ As illustrated in Figure 2, VPP-VP has contiguous spans on both source and target sides, so that we can generate a binary-branching SCFG: In this case m-gram integrated decoding can be done in O(

Although according to Zhang et al (2006), the vast majority (99.7%) of rules in their Chinese-English dataset are binarizable, there do exist some interesting cases that are not (see Figure 2 for a real-data example). $$$$$ See Algorithm 1 for details and Figure 5 for an example.

Compared with its string-based counterparts, tree-based decoding is simpler and faster: there is no need for synchronous binarization (Huang et al, 2009b; Zhang et al, 2006) and tree parsing generally runs in linear time (Huang et al, 2006). $$$$$ Several recent syntax-based models for machine translation (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2004) can be seen as instances of the general framework of synchronous grammars and tree transducers.
