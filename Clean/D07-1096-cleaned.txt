Our second-order parser still does not reproduce the state-of-the art results presented by similar systems (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ To train these classifiers and probabilitistic models several approaches were used: SVMs (Duan et al, 2007; Hall et al, 2007a; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), modified finite Newton SVMs (Wu et al, 2007), maximum entropy models (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), multiclassaveraged perceptron (Attardi et al, 2007) and max imum likelihood estimation (Watson and Briscoe, 2007).In order to calculate a global score or probabil ity for a transition sequence, two systems used a Markov chain approach (Duan et al, 2007; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007).
Our second-order parser still does not reproduce the state-of-the art results presented by similar systems (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ Thistype of scoring function is often referred to as a first order model.8 Several systems participating in this year?s shared task used first-order models (Schiehlen and Spranger, 2007; Nguyen et al, 2007; Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007; Hall et al, 2007b).

Some dependency parsing systems prefer two-stage architecture: unlabeled parsing and dependency classification (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ The CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on Dependency Parsing
Some dependency parsing systems prefer two-stage architecture: unlabeled parsing and dependency classification (Nivre et al, 2007). $$$$$ Onesystem (Hall et al, 2007b) extends this two-stage ap proach to a three-stage architecture where the parser and labeler generate an n-best list of parses which in turn is reranked.6 In ensemble-based systems several base parsers provide parsing decisions, which are added together for a combined score for each potential dependencyarc.

Morphologically rich languages present new challenges, as the use of state of the art parsers for more configurational and non-inflected languages like English does not reach similar performance levels in languages like Basque, Greek or Turkish (Nivre et al, 2007a). $$$$$ The selection of languages should be typolog ically varied and include both new languages and old languages (compared to 2006).
