For example, (Hughes and Ramage, 2007) used random walks on Wordnet graph to measure lexical semantic relatedness between words. $$$$$ Lexical Semantic Relatedness with Random Graph Walks
For example, (Hughes and Ramage, 2007) used random walks on Wordnet graph to measure lexical semantic relatedness between words. $$$$$ In this paper, we in troduce a measure of semantic relatedness based on thedivergence of the distinct stationary distributions result ing from random walks centered at different positions in the word graph.

As for Personalized PageRank, it was used for word sense disambiguation (Agirre and Soroa, 2009), and for measuring lexical relatedness of words in a graph built from WordNet (Hughes and Ramage, 2007). $$$$$ Lexical Semantic Relatedness with Random Graph Walks

As can be seen from the Table, our approach with the Weighted Overlap signature comparison improves over the similar approach of Hughes and Ramage (2007) which, however, does not involve the disambiguation step and considers a word as a whole unit as represented by the set of its senses. $$$$$ We also add bi-directional edges between Synsets whose word senses overlap with a common TokenPOS.

Graph-based methods have been successfully applied to evaluate word similarity using available ontologies, where the underlying graph included word senses and semantic relationships between them (Hughes and Ramage, 2007). $$$$$ Standard thesaurus-based measures of word pair similarity are based on only a single path between those words in the thesaurus graph.
