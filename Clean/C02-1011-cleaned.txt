On the other hand, in the framework of bilingual term correspondences estimation of this paper, the computational complexity of enumerating translation candidates can be easily avoided with the help of cross-language retrieval of relevant news texts. Furthermore, unlike Cao and Li (2002), bilingual term correspondences for compound terms are not restricted to compositional translation. $$$$$ In many cases, Base NPs represent holistic and non-divisible concepts, and thus accurate translation of them from one language to another is extremely important in applications like machine translation, cross language information retrieval, and foreign language writing assistance.
