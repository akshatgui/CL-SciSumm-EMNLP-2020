The idea of a self-customizing IE system emerged recently with the improvement of pattern acquisition techniques (Sudo et al, 2003b), where the IE system customizes itself across domains given by the user's query. $$$$$ In particular, methods have recently emerged for the acquisition of event extraction patterns without corpus annotation in view of the cost of manual labor for annotation.

In other closely related work, Sudo et al (2003) use frequent dependency subtrees as measured by TF*IDF to identify named entities and IE patterns important for a given domain. $$$$$ The model of our previous work (Sudo et al., 2001) was based on the paths from predicate nodes in dependency trees.
In other closely related work, Sudo et al (2003) use frequent dependency subtrees as measured by TF*IDF to identify named entities and IE patterns important for a given domain. $$$$$ Furthermore, it is not clear whether the extracted entities are related to the same event, because of the clausal boundaries.4 Chain model Our previous work, the Chain model (Sudo et al., 2001)5 attempts to remedy the limitations of the Predicate-Argument model.

Following (Sudo et al, 2003) we are interested only in the lexemes which are near neighbors of the most frequent verbs. $$$$$ In this section, we review two of the previous models in detail, namely the Predicate-Argument model (Yangarber et al., 2000) and the Chain model (Sudo et al., 2001).

Sudo et al (2003) evaluated how well their IE patterns captured named entities of three predefined types. $$$$$ Since all the slot-fillers in the extraction task of our experiment are assumed to be instances of the 150 classes in the extended Named Entity hierarchy (Sekine et al., 2002), further filtering was done by requiring a pattern candidate to contain at least one Named Entity class.

In addition, Sudo et al (2003) proposed representations for IE patterns which extends the SVO representation used here and, while they did not appear to significantly improve IE, it is expected that it will be straightforward to extend the vector space model to those pattern representations. $$$$$ Our research on improved representation models for extraction patterns is motivated by the limitations of the prior extraction pattern representations.

For example, Sudo et al (2003) used patterns consisting of a path from a verb to any of its descendents (direct or indirect) while Bunescuand Mooney (2005) suggest the shortest path between the items being related. $$$$$ In the prior work on extraction pattern acquisition, the representation model of the patterns was based on a fixed set of pattern templates (Riloff, 1996), or predicate-argument relations, such as subject-verb, and object-verb (Yangarber et al., 2000).

An additional advantage of linked chain patterns is that they do not cause an unwieldy number of candidate patterns to be generated unlike some other approaches for representing extraction patterns, such as the one proposed by Sudo et al (2003) where any subtree of the dependency tree can act as a potential pattern. $$$$$ Several approaches have been described for the automatic unsupervised acquisition of patterns for information extraction.

Given a dependency parse tree, any sub-tree can be a candidate template, setting some of its nodes as variables (Sudo et al, 2003). $$$$$ The model of our previous work (Sudo et al., 2001) was based on the paths from predicate nodes in dependency trees.
Given a dependency parse tree, any sub-tree can be a candidate template, setting some of its nodes as variables (Sudo et al, 2003). $$$$$ Also, since the patterns with too much context are unlikely to match with new text, we added another filtering criterion based on the number of nodes in a pattern candidate; the maximum number of nodes is 8.

Three classes of syntactic template learning approaches are presented in the literature: learning of predicate argument templates (Yangarber et al, 2000), learning of syntactic chains (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and learning of sub-trees (Sudo et al, 2003). $$$$$ In this section, we review two of the previous models in detail, namely the Predicate-Argument model (Yangarber et al., 2000) and the Chain model (Sudo et al., 2001).
