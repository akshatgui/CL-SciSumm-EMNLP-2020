There are many POS taggers developed using different techniques for many major languages such as transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al, 1992), Markov model (Cutting et al, 1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc for English. $$$$$ Statistical methods have also been used (e.g., [DeRose, 1988], [Garside et al., 1987]).

The initial phase relies on a parser that draws on the SPECIALIST Lexicon (McCray et al 1994) and the Xerox Part-of-Speech Tagger (Cutting et al 1992) to produce an underspecified categorial analysis. $$$$$ In support of this and other work, we have developed a system architecture for text access [Cutting et al., 1991].

The phrases in our bibliographic and clinical samples were then submitted to an underspecified syntactic analysis described by Rindflesch et al (2000) that draws on a stochastic tagger (see (Cutting et al, 1992) for details) as well as the SPECIALIST Lexicon, a large syntactic lexicon of both general and medical English that is distributed with the UMLS. $$$$$ In support of this and other work, we have developed a system architecture for text access [Cutting et al., 1991].

As a common strategy, POS guessers examine the endings of unknown words (Cutting et al 1992) along with their capitalization, or consider the distribution of unknown words over specific parts-of-speech (Weischedel et aL, 1993). $$$$$ Corpora are also likely to contain words that are unknown to the tagger.

The tagger used is thus one that does not need tagged and disambiguated material to be trained on, namely the XPOST originally constructed at Xerox Parc (Cutting et al 1992, Cutting and Pedersen 1993). $$$$$ The second method of training does not require a tagged training corpus.

In such cases, additional information may be coded into the HMM model to achieve higher accuracy (Cutting et al, 1992). $$$$$ Part-of-speech information facilitates higher-level analysis, such as recognizing noun phrases and other patterns in text.

(Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995) compare two tagging frameworks for tagging French, one that is statistical, built upon the Xerox tagger (Cutting et al., 1992), and another based on linguistic constraints only. $$$$$ As the resources required are simply a lexicon and a suitably large sample of ordinary text, taggers can be built with minimal effort, even for other languages, such as French (e.g., [Kupiec, 1992]).

It has been known for some years that good performance can be realized with partial tagging and a hidden Markov model (Cutting et al, 1992). $$$$$ Under this regime the model is called a hidden Markov model (HMM), as state transitions (i.e., part-of-speech categories) are assumed to be unobservable.

(Cutting et al, 1992) reported very high results (96% on the Brown corpus) for unsupervised POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) by exploiting hand-built tag dictionaries and equivalence classes. $$$$$ Training is typically performed on a sample of the corpus at hand, with the trained HMM being saved for subsequent use on the corpus at large.

In the tagging literature (e.g., Cutting et al (1992)) an ambiguity class is often composed of the set of every possible tag for a word. $$$$$ The ambiguity class of eac word is the set of its permitted parts of speech, only or of which is correct in context.
