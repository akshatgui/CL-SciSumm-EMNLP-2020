Labeled LDA (LLDA) (Ramage et al 2009a) can be used to solve this problem. $$$$$ Many modern approaches incorporate label correlations (e.g., Kazawa et al. (2004), Ji et al.

Modeling Tweets in a Latent Space: Ramage et al (2010) also use hash tags to improve the latent representation of tweets in a LDA framework, Labeled-LDA (Ramage et al, 2009), treating each hashtag as a label. $$$$$ This introduces a topic model that constrains Latent Dirichlet Allocation by defining a one-to-one correspondence between LDA’s latent topics and user tags.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation and its supervised extensions such as Labeled LDA (LLDA) (Ramage et al, 2009) and supervised LDA (sLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2008) are powerful generative models that capture the underlying semantics of texts. $$$$$ Two such models, Supervised LDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) and DiscLDA (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2008) are inappropriate for multiply labeled corpora because they limit a document to being associated with only a single label.

To address these issues we propose a distantly supervised approach which applies LabeledLDA (Ramage et al, 2009) to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data in addition to large dictionaries of entities gathered from Freebase, and combines information about an entity's context across its mentions. $$$$$ One simple approach to these challenges can be found in models that explicitly address the credit attribution problem by associating individual words in a document with their most appropriate labels.

Distant Supervision with Topic Models: To model unlabeled entities and their possible types, we apply LabeledLDA (Ramage et al, 2009), constraining each entity's distribution over topics based on its set of possible types according to Freebase. $$$$$ A third model, MM-LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), is not constrained to one label per document because it models each document as a bag of words with a bag of labels, with topics for each observation drawn from a shared topic distribution.

In other models, this input is sometimes used to "fix," i.e. deterministically hold constant topic assignments (Ramage et al, 2009). $$$$$ A third model, MM-LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), is not constrained to one label per document because it models each document as a bag of words with a bag of labels, with topics for each observation drawn from a shared topic distribution.
In other models, this input is sometimes used to "fix," i.e. deterministically hold constant topic assignments (Ramage et al, 2009). $$$$$ Since the word-topic assignments zi (see step 9 in Table 1) are drawn from this distribution, this restriction ensures that all the topic assignments are limited to the document’s labels.

To enable this, we first take class labeled data (doesn't need to be multi-class labeled data unlike (Ramage et al 2009)) and identify the discriminating features for each class. $$$$$ We will refer to this collection of data as the del.icio.us tag dataset.

L-LDA (Ramage et al, 2009) extends standard LDA to include supervision for specific target categories, yet in a different way: (i) The generative process includes a second observed variable, i.e. each document is explicitly labeled with a target category. $$$$$ The generative process for the algorithm is found in Table 1.
