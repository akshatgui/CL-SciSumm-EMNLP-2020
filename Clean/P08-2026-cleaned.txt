We applied two mainstream Penn Treebank (PTB) phrase structure parsers: the Bikel parser, implementing Collins' parsing model (Bikel, 2004) and trained on PTB, and the reranking parser of (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with the self-trained biomedical parsing model of (McClosky and Charniak, 2008). $$$$$ In particular, we self-train the standard Charniak/Johnson Penn-Treebank parser using unlabeled biomedical abstracts.

Concerning techniques for improving out-of domain parsing, a related approach has been to use self-training with auto-parsed out-of-domain data, as McClosky and Charniak (2008) do for English constituency parsing, though in that approach lexical generalization is not explicitly performed. $$$$$ Self-Training for Biomedical Parsing

Parse trees come from the Charniak-Johnson parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) with a self-trained biomedical parsing model (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), and are converted to dependency structures again using Stanford CoreNLP. $$$$$ In particular, we self-train the standard Charniak/Johnson Penn-Treebank parser using unlabeled biomedical abstracts.

The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ This was on the Lease/Charniak (L/C) parser (Lease and Charniak, 2005).2 A close second (1% behind) was 'This is not a criticism of the work.
The organizers provide parses from a version of the McClosky-Charniak parser, MCCC (McClosky and Charniak, 2008), which is a two-stage parser/reranker trained on the GENIA corpus. $$$$$ This is solely due to the introduction of the 50-best reranker which distinguishes the C/J parser from the preceding Charniak parser.

The re-ranking parser of Charniak & Johnson adapted to the biomedical domain (McClosky and Charniak, 2008). $$$$$ In particular, we self-train the standard Charniak/Johnson Penn-Treebank parser using unlabeled biomedical abstracts.

For syntactic parsing, we use the output of the BLLIP re-ranking parser adapted to the biomedical domain by McClosky and Charniak (2008), as provided by the shared task organizers in the Stanford collapsed dependency format with conjunct dependency propagation. $$$$$ Self-Training for Biomedical Parsing
