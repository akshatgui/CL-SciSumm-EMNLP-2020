 $$$$$ It can be viewed as a mixture of topic London shared by the entire review (words: “London”, “tube”, “£”), and the ratable aspect location, specific for the local context of the sentence (words: “transport”, “walk”, “bus”).
 $$$$$ This work benefited from discussions with Sasha Blair-Goldensohn and Fernando Pereira.

However, these two models either require post processing to calculate the positive/negative coverage in a document for polarity identification (Mei et al, 2007) or require some kind of supervised setting in which review text should contain ratings for aspects of interest (Titov and McDonald, 2008a). $$$$$ Text excerpts are usually extracted through string matching (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), sentence clustering (Gamon et al., 2005), or through topic models (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008).
However, these two models either require post processing to calculate the positive/negative coverage in a document for polarity identification (Mei et al, 2007) or require some kind of supervised setting in which review text should contain ratings for aspects of interest (Titov and McDonald, 2008a). $$$$$ A closely related model to ours is that of Mei et al. (2007) which performs joint topic and sentiment modeling of collections.

The multi-aspect sentiment (MAS) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), which is extended from the multi-grain latent Dirichlet allocation (MG-LDA) model (Titov and McDonald, 2008b), allows sentiment text aggregation for sentiment summary of each rating aspect extracted from MG-LDA. $$$$$ The first part is based on Multi-Grain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Titov and McDonald, 2008), which has been previously shown to build topics that are representative of ratable aspects.

Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ The second part is a set of sentiment predictors per aspect that are designed to force specific topics in the model to be directly correlated with a particular aspect.
Unlike some of the previous work (e.g., (Titov and McDonald, 2008a)), we do not constrain aspect specific sentiment to be the same across the document. $$$$$ As was demonstrated in Titov and McDonald (2008), the topics produced by LDA do not correspond to ratable aspects of entities.

In contrast, MLSLDA draws on techniques that view sentiment as a regression problem based on the topics used in a document, as in supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (SLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) or in finer-grained parts of a document (Titov and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ The first part is based on Multi-Grain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Titov and McDonald, 2008), which has been previously shown to build topics that are representative of ratable aspects.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis summarizes sentiments with diverse attributes, so that customers may have to look more closely into analyzed sentiments (Titov and McDonald, 2008). $$$$$ The first part is based on Multi-Grain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Titov and McDonald, 2008), which has been previously shown to build topics that are representative of ratable aspects.

There have been various extensions to multi-grain (Titov and McDonald, 2008a), labeled (Ramage et al, 2009), partially-labeled (Ramage et al, 2011), constrained (Andrzejewski et al, 2009) models, etc. $$$$$ In this study, we look at the problem of aspectbased sentiment summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Gamon et al., 2005; Carenini et al., 2006; Zhuang et al., 2006).1 An aspect-based summarization system takes as input a set of user reviews for a specific product or service and produces a set of relevant aspects, the aggregated sentiment for each aspect, and supporting textual evidence.
