5-gram word language models in English are trained on a variety of monolingual corpora (Brants et al, 2007). $$$$$ We trained 5-gram language models on amounts of text varying from 13 million to 2 trillion tokens.The data is divided into four sets; language mod els are trained for each set separately4 . For eachtraining data size, we report the size of the result ing language model, the fraction of 5-grams from the test data that is present in the language model, and the BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002) obtainedby the machine translation system.

In the case of language models, we often have to remove low-frequency words because of a lack of computational resources, since the feature space of k grams tends to be so large that we sometimes need cutoffs even in a distributed environment (Brantset al, 2007). $$$$$ One or more feature func tions may be of the form h(e, f) = h(e), in which case it is referred to as a language model.

To scale LMs to larger corpora with higher-order dependencies, researchers have considered alternative parameterizations such as class-based models (Brown et al, 1992), model reduction techniques such as entropy-based pruning (Stolcke, 1998), novel represent ion schemes such as suffix arrays (Emami et al, 2007), Golomb Coding (Church et al, 2007) and distributed language models that scale more readily (Brants et al, 2007). $$$$$ Recently a two-pass approach hasbeen proposed (Zhang et al, 2006), wherein a lower order n-gram is used in a hypothesis-generation phase, then later the K-best of these hypotheses are re-scored using a large-scale distributed language model.

Log-linear interpolation is particularly popular in statistical machine translation (e.g., Brants et al., 2007), because the interpolation weights can easily be discriminatively trained to optimize an end-to-end translation objective function (such as BLEU) by making the log probability according to each language model a separate feature function in the overall translation model. $$$$$ Large Language Models in Machine Translation
