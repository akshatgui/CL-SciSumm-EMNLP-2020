We employ the same algorithm used in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006) which first use the GI ZA++ (with grow-diag-final-and heuristic) to obtain the word alignment between source and target words, and then calculate the association strength between the aligned words. $$$$$ In addition, since we want to distinguish between source words that have a translation on the target side and words that do not, we also need a measure of the probability that two words are not translations of each other.

Munteanu and Marcu (2006) first extract the candidate parallel sentences from the comparable corpora and further extract the accurate sub-sentential bilingual fragments from the candidate parallel sentences using the in-domain probabilistic bilingual lexicon. $$$$$ Extracting Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments From Non-Parallel Corpora

The approach that is closest to our work is that of Munteanu and Marcu (2006): They use standard information retrieval together with simple word-based translation for CLIR, and extract phrases from the retrieval results using a clean bilingual lexicon and an averaging filter. $$$$$ The first step of the pipeline identifies document pairs that are similar (and therefore more likely to contain parallel data), using the Lemur information retrieval toolkit' (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001); each document in the source language is translated word-for-word and turned into a query, which is run against the collection of target language documents.

Our first technique resembles the technique of Munteanu and Marcu (2006) who also perform phrase extraction by combining clean alignment lexica for initial signals with heuristics to smooth alignments for final fragment extraction. $$$$$ In our experiments, we compare our fragment extraction method (which we call FragmentExtract) with the sentence extraction approach of Munteanu and Marcu (2005) (SentenceExtract).
