History-based parsing uses features of the parsing history to predict the next parser action (Black et al,1992). $$$$$ Towards History-based Grammars

Many current parsers fall into the class of history based grammars (Black et al, 1992). $$$$$ The History-based Grammar Model The history-based grammar model defines context of a parse tree in terms of the leftmost derivation of the tree.
