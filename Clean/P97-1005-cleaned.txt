We use a different kind of model here, logistic regression, which is especially well suited for categorical data analysis (cf. eg. Agresti (1990) or Kessler et al (1997)). $$$$$ We chose logistic regression (LR) as our basic numerical method.

Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ In word-sense disambiguation, many senses are largely restricted to texts of a particular style, such as colloquial or formal (for example the word pretty is far more likely to have the meaning &quot;rather&quot; in informal genres than in formal ones).
Kessler et al (1997) mention that parsing and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit from genre classification. $$$$$ First, some applications benefit from categorization according to facet, not genre.

Like Kessler et al (1997) and Argamon et al (1998) after them, they exploit (partly) hand-crafted sets of features, which are specific to texts in English. $$$$$ They too begin with a corpus of hand-classified texts, the Brown corpus.

However, additional aspects of a document in uence its relevance, including, e.g., the evidential status of the material presented, and the attitudes expressed about the topic (Kessler et al, 1997). $$$$$ Computational linguists have been concerned for the most part with two aspects of texts: their structure and their content.

Apart from two notable exceptions, namely Kessler et al (1997) and Rehm (2006) whose implementations require extensive manual annotation (Kessler et al, 1997) or analysis (Rehm, 2006), genres are usually classified as single-label discrete entities, relying on the simplified assumption that a document can be assigned to only one genre. $$$$$ Is genre a single property or attribute that can be neatly laid out in some hierarchical structure?

We plan to investigate more types of document collections pairs, e.g., the document collections from different text genres (Kessler et al, 1997). $$$$$ One important reason is that, up to now, the digitized corpora and collections which are the subject of much CL research have been for the most part generically homogeneous (i.e., collections of scientific abstracts or newspaper articles, encyclopedias, and so on), so that the problem of genre identification could be set aside.

(Kessler et al, 1997) combine these views by saying that a genre should not be so broad that the texts belonging to it don't share any distinguishing properties. $$$$$ But we would probably not use the term &quot;genre&quot; to describe merely the class of texts that have the objective of persuading someone to do something, since that class — which would include editorials, sermons, prayers, advertisements, and so forth — has no distinguishing formal properties.

This is where the caveat from (Kessler et al, 1997) be comes relevant: A particular genre shouldn't betaken so broadly as to have no distinguishing features, nor so narrowly as to have no general applicability. $$$$$ An important and more relevant set of experiments, which deserves careful attention, is presented in Karlgren and Cutting (1994).

Kessler et al (1997) avoid structural markers since they require tagged or parsed text and replace them with character-level markers (e.g., punctuation mark counts) and derivative markers, i.e., ratios and variation measures derived from measures of lexical and character-level markers. $$$$$ Character-level cues are mainly punctuation cues and other separators and delimiters used to mark text categories like phrases. clauses, and sentences (Nunberg, 1990).

Another straightforward method is the assumption that Latinate prefixes and suffixes are indicators of formality in English (Kessler et al, 1997), i.e. informal words will not have Latinate affixes such as -ation and intra-. $$$$$ Examples of ones that we use are terms of address (e.g., Mr., Ms.). which predominate in papers like the New York Times: Latinate affixes, which signal certain highbrow registers like scientific articles or scholarly works; and words used in expressing dates, which are common in certain types of narrative such as news stories.
