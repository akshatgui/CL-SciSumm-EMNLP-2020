Reverb (Fader et al 2011) is a state-of-the-art open domain extractor that targets verb-centric relations, which have been shown in Banko and Etzioni (2008) to cover over 70% of open domain relations. $$$$$ Banko and Etzioni (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) showed that a small set of POS-tag patterns cover a large fraction of relationships in English, but never incorporated the patterns into an extractor.

Literature on automatic relation discovery (Fader et al, 2011) has shown that verbal phrases uncover a large fraction of binary predicates while reducing the amount of noisy phrases that do not denote any relations. $$$$$ Open IE solves this problem by identifying relation phrases—phrases that denote relations in English sentences (Banko et al., 2007).
Literature on automatic relation discovery (Fader et al, 2011) has shown that verbal phrases uncover a large fraction of binary predicates while reducing the amount of noisy phrases that do not denote any relations. $$$$$ The results in Table 3 are similar to Banko and Etzioni’s findings that a set of eight POS patterns cover a large fraction of binary verbal relation phrases.

To this end, we used a random sample from the large scale web-based ReVerb corpus (Fader et al, 2011), comprising tuple extractions of predicate templates with their argument instantiations. $$$$$ However, their analysis was based on a set of sentences known to contain either a company acquisition or birthplace relationship, while our results are on a random sample of Web sentences.

Two example systems implementing this paradigm are TEXTRUN NER (Yates et al, 2007) and REVERB (Fader et al, 2011). $$$$$ (Banko et al., 2007; Wu and Weld, 2010; Zhu et al., 2009).

To that end, we applied the methods on a set of one billion extractions (generously provided by Fader et al (2011)) automatically extracted from the ClueWeb09 web crawl, where each extraction comprises a predicate and two arguments. $$$$$ For instance, since many of REVERB’s errors are due to incorrect arguments, improved methods for argument extraction are in order.

To build the rule-sets and models for the tested approaches we utilized the ReVerb corpus (Fader et al, 2011), a large scale publicly available web based open extractions data set, containing about 15 million unique template extractions. $$$$$ We set D to be the set of all relation phrases that take at least k distinct argument pairs in the set of extractions.

We compare OLLIE to two state-of-the-art Open IE systems: (1) REVERB (Fader et al2011), which uses shallow syntactic processing to identify relation phrases that begin with a verb and occur between the argument phrases; 2 (2) WOEparse (Wuand Weld, 2010), which uses bootstrapping from entries in Wikipedia info-boxes to learn extraction pat terns in dependency parses. $$$$$ This paper shows that the output of state-ofthe-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions.

The REVERB extractor (Fader et al 2011) on the ClueWeb09 Web corpus found over 1.4 billion noun phrases participating in textual relationships, and a sizable portion of these noun phrases are entities. $$$$$ An LVC is a multi-word expression composed of a verb and a noun, with the noun carrying the semantic content of the predicate (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Stevenson et al., 2004; Allerton, 2002).
