Two of these, P(X) and S(X) are just the prefix and suffix probability distributions for the symbol(Stolcke, 1995) $$$$$ Definition 1 The following quantities are defined relative to a SCFG G, a nonterminal X, and a string x over the alphabet E of G. where i, v2,. vk are strings of terminals and nonterminals, X -4 A is a production of G, and 1)2 is derived from vi by replacing one occurrence of X with A. b) The string probability P(X 4 x) (of x given X) is the sum of the probabilities of all left-most derivations X • • •= x producing x from X.' c) The sentence probability P(S x) (of x given G) is the string probability given the start symbol S of G. By definition, this is also the probability P(x I G) assigned to x by the grammar G. d) The prefix probability P(S 4L x) (of x given G) is the sum of the probabilities of all sentence strings having x as a prefix, In the following, we assume that the probabilities in a SCFG are proper and consistent as defined in Booth and Thompson (1973), and that the grammar contains no useless nonterminals (ones that can never appear in a derivation).
