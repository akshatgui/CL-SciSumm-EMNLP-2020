In this section, we investigate the performance of two maximum entropy classifiers (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), one for determining whether a noun phrase has a determiner or not and the other for selecting the appropriate determiner if one is needed. $$$$$ The GIS procedure, as well as the maximum entropy and maximum likelihood properties of the distribution of form (1), are described in detail in (Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
In this section, we investigate the performance of two maximum entropy classifiers (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), one for determining whether a noun phrase has a determiner or not and the other for selecting the appropriate determiner if one is needed. $$$$$ The performance of this &quot;perfect&quot; scheme is then an upper bound on the performance of any reranking scheme that might be used to reorder the top N parses.

There are two canonical parsers that fall into this category $$$$$ Table 5 shows that the maximum entropy parser performs better than the parsers presented in (Collins, 1996) and (Magerman, 1995)2, which have the best previously published parsing accuracies on the Wall St. Journal domain.
There are two canonical parsers that fall into this category $$$$$ The SPATTER parser is a history-based parser that uses decision tree models to guide the operations of a few tree building procedures.

The Chinese parse trees are produced by a maximum entropy based parser (Ratnaparkhi, 1997). $$$$$ A Linear Observed Time Statistical Parser Based On Maximum Entropy Models
The Chinese parse trees are produced by a maximum entropy based parser (Ratnaparkhi, 1997). $$$$$ Suppose there exists a &quot;perfect&quot; reranking scheme that, for each sentence, magically picks the best parse from the top N parses produced by the maximum entropy parser, where the best parse has the highest average precision and recall when compared to the treebank parse.

We demonstrate this by comparing our k-best lists to those in (Ratnaparkhi,1997), (Collins, 2000) and the parallel work by Charniak and Johnson (2005) in several ways, including oracle reranking and average number of found parses. $$$$$ Suppose there exists a &quot;perfect&quot; reranking scheme that, for each sentence, magically picks the best parse from the top N parses produced by the maximum entropy parser, where the best parse has the highest average precision and recall when compared to the treebank parse.

Ratnaparkhi (1997) introduced the idea of oracle re ranking $$$$$ Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall.

The maximum entropy parser (Ratnaparkhi, 1997) parses a sentence in three phases $$$$$ All three of the passes described in section 2 are integrated in the search, i.e., when parsing a test sentence, the input to the second pass consists of K of the best distinct POS tag assignments for the input sentence.

The SLM was trained on 20M words of WSJ text automatically parsed using the parser in (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), binarized and enriched with headwords and NT/POS tag information as explained in Section 2.2 and Section 3. $$$$$ Section 5 describes experiments with the Penn Treebank and section 6 compares this paper with previously published works.

Even though some parsers effectively exhibit linear behavior in sentence length (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), fast statistical parsers such as (Henderson, 2004) still take around 1.5 seconds for sentences of length 35 in tests that we made. $$$$$ The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length.

This is a true pipeline approach, as was done in other successful parsers, e.g. (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), in that the classifiers are trained on individual decisions rather than on the overall quality of the parser, and chained to yield the global structure. $$$$$ It should be emphasized that if K> 1, the parser does not commit to a single POS or chunk assignment for the input sentence before building constituent structure.

On the application side, (log) linear parsing models have the potential to supplant the currently dominant lexicalized PCFG models for parsing by allowing much richer feature sets and simpler smoothing, while avoiding the label bias problem that may have hindered earlier classifier-based parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1997). $$$$$ A Linear Observed Time Statistical Parser Based On Maximum Entropy Models
