In TOPICSUM (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), each word is generated by a single topic which can be a corpus-wide background distribution over common words, a distribution of document-specific words or a distribution of the core content of a given cluster. $$$$$ The KLSUM algorithm introduces a criterion for selecting a summary S given document collection D, where PS is the empirical unigram distribution of the candidate summary S and KL(P Q) represents the Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence given by divergence between the true distribution P (here the document set unigram distribution) and the approximating distribution Q (the summary distribution).

Models that use more structure in the representation of documents have also been proposed for generating more coherent and less redundant summaries, such as HIERSUM (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) and TTM (Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2011). $$$$$ Beginning with a simple word frequency based model (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), we construct a sequence of models each injecting more structure into the representation of document set content and exhibiting ROUGE gains along the way.

In our experiments, we follow the same approach as in (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) by greedily adding sentences to a summary so long as they decrease KL divergence. $$$$$ The KLSUM algorithm introduces a criterion for selecting a summary S given document collection D, where PS is the empirical unigram distribution of the candidate summary S and KL(P Q) represents the Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence given by divergence between the true distribution P (here the document set unigram distribution) and the approximating distribution Q (the summary distribution).
In our experiments, we follow the same approach as in (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) by greedily adding sentences to a summary so long as they decrease KL divergence. $$$$$ Since globally optimizing the KLSUM criterion in equation (equation (2)) is exponential in the total number of sentences in a document collection, we 21We choose σ = 0.75 in our experiments. opted instead for a simple approximation where sentences are greedily added to a summary so long as they decrease KL-divergence.

Once this is done, one of the learned collections can be used to generate the summary that best approximates this collection, using the greedy algorithm described by Haghighiand Vanderwende (2009). $$$$$ The SUMBASIC algorithm, introduced in Nenkova and Vanderwende (2005), is a simple effective procedure for multi-document extractive summarization.

One could also think of this as a version of the KLSum summarization system (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009) that stops after one sentence. $$$$$ It is worth noting however that KLSUM’s performance matches SUMFOCUS (Vanderwende et al., 2007), the highest R-2 performing system at DUC 2006.

In more recent work, Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) built a summarization system based on topic models, where both topics at general document level as well as those at specific subtopic levels were learnt. $$$$$ Exploring Content Models for Multi-Document Summarization
In more recent work, Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) built a summarization system based on topic models, where both topics at general document level as well as those at specific subtopic levels were learnt. $$$$$ In this work we examine a series of content models for multi-document summarization and argue that LDA-style probabilistic topic models (Blei et al., 2003) can offer state-of-the-art summarization quality as measured by automatic metrics (see section 5.1) and manual user evaluation (see section 5.2).

Such methods have been successfully applied to a myriad of tasks including word sense discrimination (Brody and Lapata, 2009), document summarisation (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009), areal linguistic analysis (Daume III, 2009) and text segmentation (Sun et al, 2008). $$$$$ In the common Document Understanding Conference (DUC) formulation of the task, a system takes as input a document set as well as a short description of desired summary focus and outputs a word length limited summary.1 To avoid the problem of generating cogent sentences, many systems opt for an extractive approach, selecting sentences from the document set which best reflect its core content.2 There are several approaches to modeling document content

The following models are used as benchmark $$$$$ Our model, utilizes a hierarchical LDA-style model (Blei et al., 2004) to represent content specificity as a hierarchy of topic vocabulary distributions.
The following models are used as benchmark $$$$$ PYTHY uses humangenerated summaries in order to train a sentence ranking system which discriminatively maximizes ROUGE scores.

Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) demonstrated that these models can improve the quality of generic multi-document summaries over simpler surface models. $$$$$ However, little has been done to directly compare the benefit of complex content models to simpler surface ones for generic multi-document summarization.
Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) demonstrated that these models can improve the quality of generic multi-document summaries over simpler surface models. $$$$$ In this paper we have presented an exploration of content models for multi-document summarization and demonstrated that the use of structured topic models can benefit summarization quality as measured by automatic and manual metrics.

We re-implement the HIERSUM system from Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009), and show that using our objective dramatically improves the content of extracted summaries. $$$$$ The resulting model, HIERSUM (see section 3.4), can produce general summaries as well as summaries for any of the learned sub-topics.
We re-implement the HIERSUM system from Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009), and show that using our objective dramatically improves the content of extracted summaries. $$$$$ We primarily evaluate the HIERSUM model, extracting a single summary from the general content distribution using the KLSUM criterion (see section 3.2).

This idea was first presented by Daume and Marcu (2006) for their BAYESUM system for query-focused summarization, and later adapted for non-query summarization in the TOPICSUM system by Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009). $$$$$ Daum´e III and Marcu (2006) explore a topic model similar to ours for query-focused multidocument summarization.16 Crucially however, Daum´e III and Marcu (2006) selected sentences with the highest expected number of CONTENT words.17 We found that in our model using this extraction criterion yielded 5.3 R-2 without stop words, significantly underperforming our TOPICSUM model.
This idea was first presented by Daume and Marcu (2006) for their BAYESUM system for query-focused summarization, and later adapted for non-query summarization in the TOPICSUM system by Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009). $$$$$ While many variants of the general summarization task have been proposed which utilize such information (Vanderwende et al., 2007; Nastase, 2008), this presupposes that a user knows enough of the content of a document collection in order to propose a query.

Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) presented a version of HIERSUM that models documents as a bag of bigrams, and provides results comparable to PYTHY. $$$$$ In order to put HIERSUM and PYTHY on equalfooting with respect to R-2, we instead ran HIERSUM with each sentence consisting of a bag of bigrams instead of unigrams.24 All the details of the model remain the same.
Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009) presented a version of HIERSUM that models documents as a bag of bigrams, and provides results comparable to PYTHY. $$$$$ We conclude that both PYTHY variants and HIERSUM bigram are comparable with respect to ROUGE performance.

These are based on the manual evaluation questions from DUC 2007, and are the same questions asked in Haghighi and Vanderwende (2009). $$$$$ Users were presented with 4 questions drawn from the DUC manual evaluation guidelines

Such models also provide a framework for adding additional structure to a summarization model (Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009). $$$$$ Beginning with a simple word frequency based model (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), we construct a sequence of models each injecting more structure into the representation of document set content and exhibiting ROUGE gains along the way.
