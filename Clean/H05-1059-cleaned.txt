In order to produce POS-based surprisal estimates, versions of both the training and experimental texts with their words replaced by POS were developed $$$$$ (1) Observations are typically words and their lexicalfeatures in the task of POS tagging.
In order to produce POS-based surprisal estimates, versions of both the training and experimental texts with their words replaced by POS were developed $$$$$ We split the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al, 1994) into training, development and test sets as in(Collins, 2002).

SSP performs POS tagging using an off-the-shelf tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005). $$$$$ We also present a deterministic versionof the inference method and show their effective ness with experiments of English POS tagging and chunking, using standard evaluation sets.
SSP performs POS tagging using an off-the-shelf tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005). $$$$$ This enables us to build a very efficient tagger.

Note that we allowed prefixes and suffixes of length up to 9, as in (Toutanova et al 2003) and (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005). $$$$$ To make use of the information about future tags, Toutanova et al proposed a tagging algo rithm based on bidirectional dependency networks 467(Toutanova et al, 2003) and achieved the best ac curacy on POS tagging on the Wall Street Journal corpus.
Note that we allowed prefixes and suffixes of length up to 9, as in (Toutanova et al 2003) and (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005). $$$$$ We tested the proposed bidirectional methods,conventional unidirectional methods and the bidirec tional dependency network proposed by Toutanova (Toutanova et al, 2003) for comparison.

Tsuruoka and Tsujii (2005) proposed easiest-first deterministic decoding. $$$$$ 2.2 Decoding with the Easiest-First Strategy.
