Distributional representations of words have been successfully used in many language processing tasks such as entity set expansion (Pantel et al,2009), part-of-speech (POS) tagging and chunking (Huang and Yates, 2009), ontology learning (Curran, 2005), computing semantic textual similarity (Besanc? on et al, 1999), and lexical inference (Kotlerman et al, 2012). $$$$$ 2008) and textual advertising (Chang et al. 2009).

To score relevant words not appearing in the database (due to incompleteness of the database or lexical variations), GUSP uses DASH (Pantel et al, 2009) to provide additional word-pair scoring based on lexical distributional similarity computed over general text corpora (Wikipedia in this case). $$$$$ In this paper, we propose a large-scale term similarity algorithm, based on distributional similarity, implemented in the MapReduce framework and deployed over a 200 billion word crawl of the Web.

Pantel et al (2009) discusses the issue of seed set size in detail, concluding that 5-20 seed words are often required for good performance. $$$$$ We study the impact of seed selection effect by inspecting the system performance for several randomly selected seed sets of fixed size and we find that seed set composition greatly affects performance.
