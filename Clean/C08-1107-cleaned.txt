Since we acquire verb entailment pairs based on unary templates (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) we used the Lin formula to acquire unary templates directly rather than using the DIRT formula, which is the arithmetic-geometric mean of Lin's similarities for two slots in a binary template. $$$$$ Learning Entailment Rules for Unary Templates
Since we acquire verb entailment pairs based on unary templates (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) we used the Lin formula to acquire unary templates directly rather than using the DIRT formula, which is the arithmetic-geometric mean of Lin's similarities for two slots in a binary template. $$$$$ The DIRT algorithm(Lin and Pantel, 2001) learns non-directional binary rules for templates that are paths in a depen dency parse-tree between two noun variables X and Y . The similarity between two templates t and t ? is the geometric average

Szpektor and Dagan (2008) proposed a directional similarity measure called BInc (Balanced Inclusion) that consists of Lin and Precision, as BInc (l, r)=? Lin (l, r)? Precision (l, r) 1173where l and r are the target templates. $$$$$ The DIRT algorithm(Lin and Pantel, 2001) learns non-directional binary rules for templates that are paths in a depen dency parse-tree between two noun variables X and Y .

Szpektor and Dagan (2008) also proposed a unary template, which is defined as a template consisting of one argument slot and one predicate phrase. $$$$$ 3.2 Unary Template Structure.
Szpektor and Dagan (2008) also proposed a unary template, which is defined as a template consisting of one argument slot and one predicate phrase. $$$$$ If an in frequent template has common instantiations with another template, the coverage of its features istypically high, whether or not an entailment relation exists between the two templates.

We define a unary template as a template consisting of one argument slot and one predicate, following Szpektor and Dagan (2008). $$$$$ 3.2 Unary Template Structure.
We define a unary template as a template consisting of one argument slot and one predicate, following Szpektor and Dagan (2008). $$$$$ First, for each binary rule, we generate all possible unary rules that are part of that rule (each unary template is extracted following the same procedure describedin Section 3.2).

DC follows the double conditioned contextualized similarity measure according to Equation 4, as implemented by (Ritter et al, 2010), while SC follows the single conditioned one at Equation 5, as implemented by (Dinu and Lapata, 2010b; Dinu and Lapata, 2010a). Since our model can contextualize various distributional similarity measures, we evaluated the performance of all the above methods on several base similarity measures and their learned rule sets, namely Lin (Lin, 1998), BInc (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) and vector Cosine similarity. $$$$$ The DIRT algorithm(Lin and Pantel, 2001) learns non-directional binary rules for templates that are paths in a depen dency parse-tree between two noun variables X and Y . The similarity between two templates t and t ? is the geometric average

Binc (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) is a directional similarity measure between word vectors, which outperformed Lin for predicate inference (Szpek tor and Dagan, 2008). $$$$$ Various measures wereproposed in the literature for assessing such simi larity between two words, u and v. Given a word q, its set of features F q and feature weights w q (f) for f ? F q , a common symmetric similarity measure is Lin similarity (Lin, 1998a)

Szpektor and Dagan (2008) use the distributional similarity of arguments to detect unary template entailment, whilst Berant et al (2010) apply it to binary relations in focused entailment graphs. $$$$$ Learning Entailment Rules for Unary Templates

Algorithms for computing semantic textual similarity (STS) are relevant for a variety of applications, including in formation extraction (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008), question answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006) and machine translation (Mirkin et al, 2009). $$$$$ In many NLP applications, such as Question An swering (QA) and Information Extraction (IE), it is crucial to recognize whether a specific target meaning is inferred from a text.

In (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008), two approaches for unsupervised learning of unary rules (i.e. between templates with a single variable) are investigated. In (Zhao et al, 2009), a pivot approach for extracting paraphrase patterns from bilingual parallel corpora is presented, while in (Callison-Burch,2008) the quality of paraphrase extraction from parallel corpora is improved by requiring that phrases and their paraphrases have the same syntactic type. Our approach is different from theirs in many respects $$$$$ Most work on unsupervised entailment rule acquisition focused on rules between templates with two variables, ignoring unary rules - entailment rules betweentemplates with a single variable.

Recently, (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) tried identifying the entailment relation between lexical-syntactic templates using WeedsPrec, but observed that it tends to promote unreliable relations involving infrequent templates. $$$$$ Learning Entailment Rules for Unary Templates
Recently, (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) tried identifying the entailment relation between lexical-syntactic templates using WeedsPrec, but observed that it tends to promote unreliable relations involving infrequent templates. $$$$$ Templatesare matched using a syntactic matcher that han dles simple morpho-syntactic phenomena, as in (Szpektor and Dagan, 2007).

Finally, we adopt the balancing approach in (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008), which, as explained in Section 2, penalizes similarity for infrequent words having fewer features (4 th property) (in our version, we truncated LIN similarity lists after top 1000 words). $$$$$ Various measures wereproposed in the literature for assessing such simi larity between two words, u and v. Given a word q, its set of features F q and feature weights w q (f) for f ? F q , a common symmetric similarity measure is Lin similarity (Lin, 1998a)

Last, a richer form of representation, termed unary, has been suggested where a different predicate is defined for each argument (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008). $$$$$ All rules were learned in canonical form (Szpektor and Dagan, 2007).
