Such structures have received considerable attention and their models are often referred to as discourse/dialogue grammars (Polanyi and Scha, 1984) or conversational/dialogue games (Levin and Moore, 1988). $$$$$ An ATN parser of this sort models important aspects of the discourse process.

It is also closer to some methods for incremental daptation of discourse structures, where additions are allowed to the right-frontier of a tree structure (e.g. Polanyi and Scha 1984). $$$$$ This does not mean, however, that every discourse is to be analysed in terms of a five level tree structure, with levels corresponding to dcu, DU, Topic, Speech Event and Interaction.
