First, as originally advocated by Hobbs (1985), we adopt an ONTOLOGICALLY PROMISCUOUS representation that includes a wide variety of types of entities. $$$$$ In this paper I propose a flat logical notation with an ontologically promiscuous semantics.

Second, in keeping with ontological promiscuity (Hobbs, 1985), we represent the importance of attributes by the salience of events and states in the discourse model - these states and events now have the same status in the discourse model as any other entities. $$$$$ In discourse one not only makes predications about such ephemera as events, states and conditions.

[Hobbs 1985] describes a similar approach by introducing what he calls 'nominalization'. $$$$$ Hence, I propose a logical notation that provides two sets of predicates that are systematically related, by introducing what might be called a -nominalization* operator '.

Note that the predicate language representation utilized by Carmel-Tools is in the style of Davidsonian event based semantics (Hobbs, 1985). $$$$$ First note that this representation does not imply that John is a man, for we have not asserted E's existence in the real world, and almost is opaque and does not imply its argument's existence.
