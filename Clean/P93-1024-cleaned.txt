Distributional clustering of words was first proposed by Pereira Tishby and Leein (Pereira et al, 1993): They cluster nouns according to their conditional verb distributions. $$$$$ Distributional Clustering Of English Words
Distributional clustering of words was first proposed by Pereira Tishby and Leein (Pereira et al, 1993): They cluster nouns according to their conditional verb distributions. $$$$$ To cluster nouns n according to their conditional verb distributions prz, we need a measure of similarity between distributions.

The cluster output can then be used as classes for selectional preferences (Pereira et al, 1993), or one can directly use frequency information from distributionally similar words for smoothing (Grishman and Sterling, 1994). $$$$$ His notion of similarity seems to agree with our intuitions in many cases, but it is not clear how it can be used directly to construct word classes and corresponding models of association.
The cluster output can then be used as classes for selectional preferences (Pereira et al, 1993), or one can directly use frequency information from distributionally similar words for smoothing (Grishman and Sterling, 1994). $$$$$ While it may be worth basing such a model on preexisting sense classes (Resnik, 1992), in the work described here we look at how to derive the classes directly from distributional data.

This indicates that techniques for differentiating between different senses are needed e.g., using a soft clustering technique as in (Pereira et al 1993) instead of a hard clustering technique. $$$$$ More specifically, we model senses as probabilistic concepts or clusters c with corresponding cluster membership probabilities p(clw) for each word w. Most other class-based modeling techniques for natural language rely instead on &quot;hard&quot; Boolean classes (Brown et al., 1990).
This indicates that techniques for differentiating between different senses are needed e.g., using a soft clustering technique as in (Pereira et al 1993) instead of a hard clustering technique. $$$$$ It turns out that the problem is avoided by our clustering technique, since it does not need to compute the KL distance between individual word distributions, but only between a word distribution and average distributions, the current cluster centroids, which are guaranteed to be nonzero whenever the word distributions are.

Hatzivassiloglou and MeKeown (1993) clustered adjectives into semantic classes, and Pereira et al (1993) clustered nouns on their appearance in verb-object pairs. $$$$$ This collection process yielded 1112041 verb-object pairs.
Hatzivassiloglou and MeKeown (1993) clustered adjectives into semantic classes, and Pereira et al (1993) clustered nouns on their appearance in verb-object pairs. $$$$$ As the figure shows, the cluster model provides over one bit of information about the selectional properties of the new nouns, but the overtraining effect is even sharper than for the held-out data involving the 1000 clustered nouns.

Of course, this is one of many different possible similarity measures which could have been used (Pereira et al (1993)), including ones that do not depend on additional labels. $$$$$ This requires a reasonable definition of verb similarity and a similarity estimation method.

Distributional clustering (Dcluster) (Pereira et al., 1993) measures similarity among words in terms of the similarity among their local contexts. $$$$$ Words are represented by the relative frequency distributions of contexts in which they appear, and relative entropy between those distributions is used as the similarity measure for clustering.

In particular, a cluster learning algorithm that permits clusters to split and/or merge, as in Petrov et al (2006) or in Pereira et al (1993), may be appropriate. $$$$$ We say then that the original cluster has split into the two new clusters.

Lexical relatedness between terms could be derived either from a thesaurus like WordNet or from raw monolingual corpora via distributional similarity (Pereira et al, 1993). $$$$$ The scientific questions arise in connection to distributional views of linguistic (particularly lexical) structure and also in relation to the question of lexical acquisition both from psychological and computational learning perspectives.

Our approach differs from standard word clustering in that the clustering criteria is directly linked to the re ranking objective, whereas previous word clustering approaches (e.g. Brown et al (1992) or Pereira et al (1993)) have typically leveraged distributional similarity. $$$$$ Distributional Clustering Of English Words

Pereira et al (1993) suggested deterministic annealing to cluster verb-argument pairs into classes of verbs and nouns. $$$$$ Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical &quot;soft&quot; clustering of the data.
Pereira et al (1993) suggested deterministic annealing to cluster verb-argument pairs into classes of verbs and nouns. $$$$$ The analogy with statistical mechanics suggests a deterministic annealing procedure for clustering (Rose et al., 1990), in which the number of clusters is determined through a sequence of phase transitions by continuously increasing the parameter 0 following an annealing schedule.
