In Pradhan et al (2005), we reported on a first attempt to overcome this problem by combining semantic role labels produced from different syntactic parses. $$$$$ We formulate the semantic labeling problem as a multi-class classification problem using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Hacioglu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004) TinySVM2 along with YamCha3 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are used to implement the system.

 $$$$$ A dependency grammar should generate shorter paths from the predicate to dependent words in the sentence, and could be a more robust complement to the phrase structure grammar paths extracted from the Charniak parse tree.

In (Pradhan et al, 2005b), some experiments were conducted on SRL systems trained using different syntactic views. $$$$$ Experiments were conducted to evaluate three types of improvements to the system

To solve these errors, we need to explore more, such as using n-best parses and the use of several syntactic views (Pradhan et al, 2005b). $$$$$ As described in (Pradhan et al., 2004), we postprocess the n-best hypotheses using a trigram language model of the argument sequence.

Kernel Setup $$$$$ For each constituent in the Charniak parse tree, if there was a dependency between the head word of the constituent and the predicate, then the corresponding CCG features for those words were added to the features for that constituent.
Kernel Setup $$$$$ We added the predicate context to capture predicate sense variations.
