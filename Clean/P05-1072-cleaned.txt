In Pradhan et al (2005), we reported on a first attempt to overcome this problem by combining semantic role labels produced from different syntactic parses. $$$$$ We formulate the semantic labeling problem as a multi-class classification problem using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (Hacioglu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004) TinySVM2 along with YamCha3 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are used to implement the system.

 $$$$$ A dependency grammar should generate shorter paths from the predicate to dependent words in the sentence, and could be a more robust complement to the phrase structure grammar paths extracted from the Charniak parse tree.

In (Pradhan et al, 2005b), some experiments were conducted on SRL systems trained using different syntactic views. $$$$$ Semantic Role Labeling Using Different Syntactic Views
In (Pradhan et al, 2005b), some experiments were conducted on SRL systems trained using different syntactic views. $$$$$ Experiments were conducted to evaluate three types of improvements to the system: i) adding new features including features extracted from a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parse, ii) performing feature selection and calibration and iii) combining parses obtained from semantic parsers trained using different syntactic views.

More details of this system can be found in Pradhan et al, (2005). $$$$$ For our experiments, we use Feb 2004 release of PropBank1 (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Palmer et al., 2005), a corpus in which predicate argument relations are marked for verbs in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1994).

To solve these errors, we need to explore more, such as using n-best parses and the use of several syntactic views (Pradhan et al, 2005b). $$$$$ Semantic Role Labeling Using Different Syntactic Views
To solve these errors, we need to explore more, such as using n-best parses and the use of several syntactic views (Pradhan et al, 2005b). $$$$$ As described in (Pradhan et al., 2004), we postprocess the n-best hypotheses using a trigram language model of the argument sequence.

Some other work paid much attention to the robust SRL (Pradhan et al, 2005b) and post inference (Punyakanok et al, 2004). $$$$$ The baseline feature set is a combination of features introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and ones proposed in Pradhan et al., (2004), Surdeanu et al., (2003) and the syntactic-frame feature proposed in (Xue and Palmer, 2004).

Kernel Setup: We use the Constituent, Predicate, and Predicate-Constituent related features, which are reported to get the best-reported performance (Pradhan et al, 2005a), as the baseline features. $$$$$ For each constituent in the Charniak parse tree, if there was a dependency between the head word of the constituent and the predicate, then the corresponding CCG features for those words were added to the features for that constituent.
