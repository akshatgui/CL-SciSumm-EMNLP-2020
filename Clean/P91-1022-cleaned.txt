There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment: the length-based approach (Gale and Church 1991 and Brown et al 1991), the lexical approach (key and Roscheisen 1993), and the combination of them (Chen 1993, Wu 1994 and Langlais 1998, etc.). $$$$$ The lynchpin of their approach is a large collection of pairs of sentences that are mutual translations.

Using this search method meant that no prior segmentation of the corpora was needed (Moore, 2002), either in terms of aligned paragraphs (Gale and Church, 1991), or some aligned sentences as anchors (Brown et al, 1991). $$$$$ The work of Gale and Church , [Gale and Church, 1991], who use a. very similar method but measure sentence lengths in characters rather than in words, supports this promise of wider applicability.

This model is trained on approximately 5 million sentence pairs of Hansard (Canadian parliamentary) and UN proceedings which have been aligned on a sentence-by-sentence basis by the methods of (Brown et al, 1991), and then further aligned on a word-by-word basis by methods similar to (Brown et al, 1993). $$$$$ Recent work by Brown et al., [Brown et al., 1988, Brown et at., 1990] has quickened anew the long dormant idea of using statistical techniques to carry out machine translation from one natural language to another.

Given that lexical methods can be computationally expensive, our idea was to try a simple length-based approach similar to that of Brown et al (1991) for sentence alignment and then use lexical methods to align words within aligned sentences. $$$$$ Recent work by Brown et al., [Brown et al., 1988, Brown et at., 1990] has quickened anew the long dormant idea of using statistical techniques to carry out machine translation from one natural language to another.
Given that lexical methods can be computationally expensive, our idea was to try a simple length-based approach similar to that of Brown et al (1991) for sentence alignment and then use lexical methods to align words within aligned sentences. $$$$$ Our algorithm makes no use of the lexical details of the corpora, but deals only with the number of words in each sentence.

Thus, dynamic programming based sentence alignment algorithms rely on paragraph anchors (Brown et al 1991) or lexical information, such as cognates (Simard 1992), to maintain a high accuracy rate. $$$$$ The minor anchors are much more common than any particular major anchor, making an alignment based on them less robust against deletions than one based on the major anchors.
Thus, dynamic programming based sentence alignment algorithms rely on paragraph anchors (Brown et al 1991) or lexical information, such as cognates (Simard 1992), to maintain a high accuracy rate. $$$$$ Given the costs described above, it is a standard problem in dynamic programming to find that alignment of the major anchors in the two corpora with the least total cost [Bellman, 1957].

For instance, to produce sentence alignments, Brown et al (1991) and Gale and Church (1991) both proposed methods that completely ignored the lexical content of the texts and both reported accuracy levels exceeding 98%. $$$$$ The work of Gale and Church , [Gale and Church, 1991], who use a. very similar method but measure sentence lengths in characters rather than in words, supports this promise of wider applicability.

In (Gale and Church, 1991) and (Brown et al, 1991), the authors start from the fact that the length of a source text sentence is highly correlated with the length of its target text translation: short sentences tend to have short translations, and long sentences tend to have long translations. $$$$$ Recent work by Brown et al., [Brown et al., 1988, Brown et at., 1990] has quickened anew the long dormant idea of using statistical techniques to carry out machine translation from one natural language to another.

A bilingual sentence alignment program (Gale and Church, 1991, and Brown et al, 1991) is the crucial part in this adaptation procedure, in that it collects bilingual document pairs from the Inter net, and identifies sentence pairs, which should have a high likelihood of being correct translations of each other. $$$$$ The work of Gale and Church , [Gale and Church, 1991], who use a. very similar method but measure sentence lengths in characters rather than in words, supports this promise of wider applicability.
