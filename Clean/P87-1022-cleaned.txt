Centering models local coherence rather generally and has been applied to the generation of referring expressions (Kibble and Power, 2004), to resolve pronouns (Brennan et al, 1987, inter alia), to score essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004), to arrange sentences in the correct order (Karamanis et al, 2009), and to many other tasks. $$$$$ A Centering Approach To Pronouns
Centering models local coherence rather generally and has been applied to the generation of referring expressions (Kibble and Power, 2004), to resolve pronouns (Brennan et al, 1987, inter alia), to score essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004), to arrange sentences in the correct order (Karamanis et al, 2009), and to many other tasks. $$$$$ On this view, a key element of local coherence is centering, a system of rules and constraints that govern the relationship between what the discourse is about and some of the linguistic choices made by the discourse participants, e.g. choice of grammatical function, syntactic structure, and type of referring expression (proper noun, definite or indefinite description, reflexive or personal pronoun, etc.).

To our knowledge, there are only two focus-based pronoun resolution algorithms that are specified in enough detail to work on unrestricted naturally occurring text: Brennan et al (1987) using the definition of utterance according to Kameyama (1998), and Struhe (1998). $$$$$ The proposed Cb was realized as a pronoun.

In Section 4, I compare the results of my algorithm with the results of the centering algorithm (Brennan et al, 1987) with and without specifications for complex sentences (Kameyama, 1998). $$$$$ There are other interesting questions concerning the centering algorithm.

For their centering algorithm, Brennan et al (1987, henceforth BFP-algorithm) extend the notion of centering transition relations, which hold across adjacent utterances, to differentiate types of shift. $$$$$ Definitions of these transition types appear in figure 1.
For their centering algorithm, Brennan et al (1987, henceforth BFP-algorithm) extend the notion of centering transition relations, which hold across adjacent utterances, to differentiate types of shift. $$$$$ Given that the transition is a shift, there seem to be more and less coherent ways to shift.

To illustrate this algorithm, we consider example (1) (Brennan et al, 1987) which has two different final utterances (ld) and (ld~). $$$$$ This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the final utterance achieves a shift (see figure 4).

Table 1 shows the most common classification into the four types CONTINUE, RETAIN, SMOOTH-SHIFT, and ROUGH-SHIFT, which are predicted to be less and less coherent in this order (Brennan et al, 1987). $$$$$ Given that the transition is a shift, there seem to be more and less coherent ways to shift.
Table 1 shows the most common classification into the four types CONTINUE, RETAIN, SMOOTH-SHIFT, and ROUGH-SHIFT, which are predicted to be less and less coherent in this order (Brennan et al, 1987). $$$$$ A transition for Un is ranked more highly if Cb(Un) = CP(U); this state we call shifting-1 and it represents a more coherent way to shift.

Finally, the measure M.BFP (Brennan et al, 1987) uses a lexicographic ordering on 4-tupleswhich indicate whether the transition is a CONTINUE, RETAIN, SMOOTH-SHIFT, or ROUGH SHIFT. $$$$$ Given that the transition is a shift, there seem to be more and less coherent ways to shift.
Finally, the measure M.BFP (Brennan et al, 1987) uses a lexicographic ordering on 4-tupleswhich indicate whether the transition is a CONTINUE, RETAIN, SMOOTH-SHIFT, or ROUGH SHIFT. $$$$$ A computational system for generation would try to plan a retention as a signal of an impending shift, so that after a retention, a shift would be preferred rather than a continuation.

Note that common centering algorithms (e.g., the one by Brennan et al (1987)) are specified only for the resolution of anaphors in Ui-1. $$$$$ Note that these transitions are more specific than focus movement as described in [Sid83].
Note that common centering algorithms (e.g., the one by Brennan et al (1987)) are specified only for the resolution of anaphors in Ui-1. $$$$$ This is true in cases when a partially specified semantic description is consistent with more than one interpretation.

The rules are applied locally, across adjacent sequences of utterances (Brennan et al., 1987). $$$$$ The formal system of constraints and rules for centering, as we have interpreted them from [GJW86], are as follows.

The first strategy is clearly appropriate for interpretation (cf. Brennan et al 1987) but for generation the issue is less clear-cut. $$$$$ Because of rule 2, the interpretation in figure 5 is preferred over the one in figure 6.
