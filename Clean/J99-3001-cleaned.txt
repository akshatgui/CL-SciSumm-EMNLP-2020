Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain be tween subject hood and being discourse-old. $$$$$ Using these proposals as a point of departure, we shall develop our own proposal—functional centering (Strube and Hahn 1996).
Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain be tween subject hood and being discourse-old. $$$$$ A resolution module for (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1995) and one for functional anaphora (Hahn, Markert, and Strube 1996) based on this functional centering model has been implemented as part of PARSETALK, a comprehensive text parser for German (Hahn, Schacht, and Broker 1994; Hahn, Neuhaus, and Broker 1997) in our group.

For example, Strube and Hahn (1999) introduce Functional Centering, a variant of Centering Theory which utilizes information status distinctions between hearer-old and hearer-new entities. $$$$$ These new criteria are based on the distinction between hearer-old and hearer-new discourse entities.

Violations of CHEAPNESS (Strube and Hahn, 1999), COHERENCE and SALIENCE (Kibble and Power, 2000). $$$$$ The ordering constraints we supply account for all of the types of anaphora mentioned above, including (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1995; Hahn and Strube 1996).

work has also been done on adapting the centering model to other, freer word order languages such as German (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ Our own work on the centering model' (Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn and Strube 1996) brings in evidence from German, a free-word-order language in which grammatical role information is far less predictive of the organization of centers than for fixed-word-order languages such as English.
work has also been done on adapting the centering model to other, freer word order languages such as German (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ We diverge from this proposal and claim that, at least for languages with relatively free word order (such as German), the functional information structure of the utterance is crucial for the ranking of discourse entities in the Cf list.

Finally, the scripts determine whether CBn is the same as CPn, known as the principle of cheapness (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ The ordering constraints we supply account for all of the types of anaphora mentioned above, including (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1995; Hahn and Strube 1996).

 $$$$$ Both of them find a correspondence between the Cb and the theme or the topic of an utterance.

Arguably, the free word-order of German arguably leads to a clearer distinction between grammatical function, surface order, and in formation status (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ Our own work on the centering model' (Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn and Strube 1996) brings in evidence from German, a free-word-order language in which grammatical role information is far less predictive of the organization of centers than for fixed-word-order languages such as English.

Thus the size of the annotated data (3,115 personal pronouns1, 2,198 possessive pronouns, 928 demonstrative pronouns) compares favourably with the size of evaluation data in other proposals (619 German pronouns in (Strube and Hahn, 1999), 2,477 English pronouns in (Ge et al, 1998), about 5,400 English co referential expressions in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)) .In the experiments, systems only looked for single NP antecedents. $$$$$ The first row gives the number of third person pronouns and possessive pronouns in the data.

In general, however, the required knowledge sources are lacking, so they must be hand-coded and can only be applied in restricted domains (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ The ordering constraints we supply account for all of the types of anaphora mentioned above, including (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1995; Hahn and Strube 1996).
In general, however, the required knowledge sources are lacking, so they must be hand-coded and can only be applied in restricted domains (Strube and Hahn, 1999). $$$$$ All these modules are fully operational and integrated within the text-understanding backbone of SYNDIK ATE, a large-scale text knowledge acquisition system for the two real-world domains of information technology (Hahn and Schnattinger 1998) and medicine (Hahn, Romacker, and Schulz 1999).

Strube and Hahn (1999) extend the context to more than the last sentence, but switch preference order between the last and the current sentence so that an antecedentes determined in the last sentence, whenever possible. $$$$$ Based on previous work about Turkish, Hoffman argues that, in this language, the sentence-initial position corresponds to the topic, the position that immediately precedes the verb yields the focus, and the remainder of the sentence is to be considered the (back)ground.

Strube (1998) and Strube and Hahn (1999) argue that the information status of an antecedent is more important than the grammatical role in which it occurs. $$$$$ Our own work on the centering model' (Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn and Strube 1996) brings in evidence from German, a free-word-order language in which grammatical role information is far less predictive of the organization of centers than for fixed-word-order languages such as English.

Moreover, in order to compare our proposal with Centering approach, Functional Centering by Strube and Hahn (1999) has also been implemented. $$$$$ In any case, they do not compare to the results of the functional approach.

Finally, a transition is considered to satisfy the CHEAPNESS constraint (Strube and Hahn, 1999) if Cb (ui)= Cp (ui). $$$$$ The most highly ranked element of Cf(DS, LJ) that is finally realized in Ui+i (i.e., is associated with an expression that has a valid interpretation in the underlying semantic representation) is the actual Cb(DS, U,±1).
Finally, a transition is considered to satisfy the CHEAPNESS constraint (Strube and Hahn, 1999) if Cb (ui)= Cp (ui). $$$$$ An utterance U1, for instance, which intervenes between Lti_i and /11+1 without any relation to Ui_i does not affect the preference decisions in Ui+2 for FunC, although it does affect them for the BFP algorithm, since the latter cannot assign the Cb(Ui+i).
