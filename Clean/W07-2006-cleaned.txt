To address this issue, a coarse-grained English all-words task (Navigli et al, 2007) was conducted during SemEval-2007. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 07

For example, in the English coarse grained all words task (Navigli et al,2007) at the recent SemEval Workshop the base line of choosing the most frequent sense using the first WordNet sense attained precision and recall of 78.9% which is only a few percent lower than the top scoring system which obtained 82.5%. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 07

The problem of how to cluster fine-grained senses into coarse senses is hard, especially if consensus is required (Navigli et al 2007). $$$$$ In most of the cases, weasked the lexicographer to map senses of the orig inal word to senses of lexically-related words (e.g. WordNet senses of procedural were mapped to ODE senses of procedure, etc.).

Similarly, the performance of WSD systems clearly indicates that WSD is not easy unless one adopts a coarse-grained approach, and then systems tagging all words at best perform a few percentage points above the most frequent sense heuristic (Navigli et al, 2007). $$$$$ LCC-WSD ? ?

Finally, results are presented from the SemEval-2007 coarse grained all-words task (Navigli et al, 2007), and we explore the influence of various types of selectors on the algorithm in order to draw insight for future improvement of Web-based methods. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 07

The sense inventory was created by mapping senses in WordNet 2.1 to the Oxford Dictionary of English (Navigli et al., 2007). $$$$$ The method consists of automatically map ping WordNet senses to top level, numbered entries in the Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE, (Soanesand Stevenson, 2003)).
The sense inventory was created by mapping senses in WordNet 2.1 to the Oxford Dictionary of English (Navigli et al., 2007). $$$$$ When this mapping was not straightforward, we just adopted the WordNet sense inventory for that word.We released the entire sense groupings (those in duced from the manual mapping for words in the test set plus those automatically derived on the other words) and made them available to the participants.

For SemEval 2007, all systems performed better than the random base line of 53.43%, but only 4 of 13 systems achieved an F1 score higher than the MFS baseline of 78.89% (Navigli et al, 2007). Table 2 lists the results of applying the generalized Web selector algorithm described in this paper in a straight-forward manner, such that all scale (T) are set to 1. $$$$$ We calculated a MFS baseline of 78.89% and a random baseline of 52.43%.

This will allow to asses its applicability to realistic tasks, such as query processing or document indexing.

 $$$$$ To this end, besidethe expert lexicographer, a second author indepen dently performed part of the manual sense mapping (590 word senses) described in Section 2.2.

For the SemEval workshop, only 6 of 15 systems performed better than this baseline on the nouns (Navigli et al, 2007), all of which used MFS as a back off strategy and an external sense tagged data set. $$$$$ the system used the MFS as a backoff strategy; 3.

Currently supervised methods achieve the best disambiguation quality (about 80% precision and recall for coarse-grained WSD in the most recent WSD evaluation conference SemEval 2007 (Navigli et al, 2007)). $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task 07
