The standard approach to framing dependency parsing as an integer linear program was introduced by (Riedel and Clarke, 2006), who converted the MST parser of (McDonald et al 2005) to use ILP for inference. The key idea is to build a complete graph consisting of tokens of the sentence where each edge is weighted by a learned scoring function. $$$$$ Chu-Liu-Edmonds(G, s) Graph G = (V, E) Edge weight function s
