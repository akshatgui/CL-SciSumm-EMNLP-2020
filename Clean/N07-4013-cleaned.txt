We turned to TextRunner (Yates et al, 2007) as a large source of background knowledge about pre-existing relations between nominals. $$$$$ Because TEXTRUNNER has no pre-defined relations, it may extract many different strings representing the same relation.

Yates (2009) considers the output from an open information extraction system (Yates et al, 2007) and clusters predicates and arguments using string similarity and a combination of constraints. $$$$$ TextRunner

Two example systems implementing this paradigm are TEXTRUNNER (Yates et al, 2007) and REVERB (Fader et al, 2011). $$$$$ (Banko et al., 2007) TEXTRUNNER is a fullyimplemented, highly scalable example of OIE.

In contrast, when research focuses on any relation, as in TextRunner (Yates et al, 2007), there is no standardized manner for re-using the pattern learned. $$$$$ For a full discussion of previous work, please see (Banko et al., 2007), or see (Yates and Etzioni, 2007) for work relating to synonym resolution.

The online demo of TextRunner (Yates et al, 2007) actually allowed us to collect the arguments for all our semantic relations. $$$$$ For a full discussion of previous work, please see (Banko et al., 2007), or see (Yates and Etzioni, 2007) for work relating to synonym resolution.
