Markert et al (2003) used the Web and the construction method to extract information about hyponymy used to resolve other-anaphora (achieving an f value of around 67%) as well as the BDs in the Vieira-Poesio dataset (their results for these cases were not better than those obtained by (Vieira and Poesio, 2000)). $$$$$ The results in this table were obtained by considering as potential antecedents indefinites (i.e., NPs with determiners a, an, and some; bare NPs; and cardinal plurals), possessives, and definite descriptions, as in Vieira and Poesio (1996); we also used the premodification heuristics proposed there.

One common approach involves the design of heuristic rules to identify specific types of (non) anaphoric NPs such as pleonastic pronouns (e.g., Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), Denber (1998)) and definite descriptions (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)). $$$$$ 2 in fact, it is precisely because we are interested in identifying the types of commonsense reasoning actually used in language processing that we focused on definite descriptions rather than on other types of anaphoric expressions (such as pronouns and ellipsis) that can be processed much more effectively on the basis of syntactic information alone (Lappin and Leass 1994; Hardt 1997).

While the resolution of pronominal anaphora and tracking of named entities is possible with good accuracy, the resolution of definite NPs (having a common noun as their head) is usually limited to the cases that Vieira and Poesio (2000) call direct coreference, where both coreferent mentions have the same head. $$$$$ We will use the term direct anaphora when both description and antecedent have the same head noun, as in a house.

For the discourse-new classification task, the model's most important feature is whether the head word of the NP to be classified has occurred previously (as in Ng and Cardie (2002) and Vieira and Poesio (2000)). $$$$$ The results just discussed led us to adopt a model of definite descriptions processing advanced in Fraurud (1990) and further elaborated in Poesio and Vieira (1998), according to which interpreting definite descriptions in written discourse is not just a matter of checking whether there is a suitable antecedent for the description, but also involves a classification task: recognizing whether a description is, in Fraurud's terms, first-mention or subsequent-mention—or, in our terminology, direct anaphora, discourse-new, or bridging.
