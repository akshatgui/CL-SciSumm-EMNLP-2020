Deductive logic (Pereira and Warren, 1983), extended with semi rings (Goodman, 1999), is an established formal ism used in parsing. $$$$$ These problems do not preclude its use for creating uniquely efficient parsers for suitably constructed grammars (Warren and Pereira, 1983: Pereira, 1982), but the broader questions of the relation between parsing and deduction and of the derivation of online parsing algorithms for unification formalisms require that we look at a more generally applicable class of proof procedures.

While chart parsing can famously be cast as deduction (Pereira and Warren, 1983), what chart parsing really is is an algebraic closure over the rules of a phrase structure grammar, which is most naturally expressed inside a constraint solver such as CHR (Morawietz, 2000). $$$$$ Parsing As Deduction

Basically, it is similar to Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970), augmented with unification (Pereira and Warren, 1983) and probability (Paeseler, 1987), but with a delayed commitment approach to scoring (Aho and Peterson, 1972). $$$$$ 1080) and Earley (Earley, 1970).

But if we use existing techniques for parsing DCGs, then we are also confronted with an undecidability problem: the recognition problem for DCGs is undecidable (Pereira and Warren, 1983). $$$$$ This result can be adapted easily to DCGs, showing that the parsing problem for offline-parsable DCGs is decidable.

In particular, we developed an architecture inspired by the Earley deduction work of Pereira and Warren (1983) but which generalized that work allowing for its use in both a parsing and generation mode merely by setting the values of a small number of parameters. $$$$$ The connection between parsing and deduction was developed further in the design of the Earley Deduction proof procedure (Warren, 1975), which will also be discussed at length here.
