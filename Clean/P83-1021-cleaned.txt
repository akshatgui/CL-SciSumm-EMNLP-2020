Deductive logic (Pereira and Warren, 1983), extended with semi rings (Goodman, 1999), is an established formal ism used in parsing. $$$$$ These problems do not preclude its use for creating uniquely efficient parsers for suitably constructed grammars (Warren and Pereira, 1983

While chart parsing can famously be cast as deduction (Pereira and Warren, 1983), what chart parsing really is is an algebraic closure over the rules of a phrase structure grammar, which is most naturally expressed inside a constraint solver such as CHR (Morawietz, 2000). $$$$$ Parsing As Deduction

Basically, it is similar to Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970), augmented with unification (Pereira and Warren, 1983) and probability (Paeseler, 1987), but with a delayed commitment approach to scoring (Aho and Peterson, 1972). $$$$$ 1080) and Earley (Earley, 1970).
