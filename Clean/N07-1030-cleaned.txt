It is also similar to the MLN-JOINT (BF) model of Song et al (2012), but we enforce the single parent constraint at a deeper structural level, allowing us to treat non-anaphoricity symmetrically with coreference as in Denis and Baldridge (2007) and Stoyanov and Eisner (2012). $$$$$ In the system of Soon et. al.

Denis and Baldridge (2007) adopted an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for coreference resolution which models anaphoricity and coreference as a joint task. $$$$$ In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for coreference resolution which models anaphoricity and coreference as a joint task, such that each local model informs the other for the final assignments. joint ILP formulation provides score improvements of 3.7-5.3% over a base coreference classifier on the ACE datasets.

 $$$$$ This section provides the performance of the pairwise coreference classifier, both when used alone (COREF-PAIRWISE) and when used in a cascade where the anaphoricity classifier acts as a filter on which mentions should be resolved (AC-CASCADE).

Extending Denis and Baldridge (2007) and Finkel and Manning (2008)'s work, we exploit loose transitivity constraints on coreference pairs. $$$$$ In future work, we will explore the use of global constraints, similar to those used by (Barzilay and Lapata, 2006) to improve both precision and recall.
Extending Denis and Baldridge (2007) and Finkel and Manning (2008)'s work, we exploit loose transitivity constraints on coreference pairs. $$$$$ For example, we expect transitivity constraints over coreference pairs, as well as constraints on the entire partition (e.g., the number of entities in the document), to help considerably.

Denis and Baldridge (2007) proposed an ILP formulation to find the optimal solution for the problem. $$$$$ Our problem formulation and use of ILP are based on both (Roth and Yih, 2004) and (Barzilay and Lapata, 2006).
Denis and Baldridge (2007) proposed an ILP formulation to find the optimal solution for the problem. $$$$$ Given the rapidly growing size of Bell trees, Luo et al. resort to a beam search algorithm and various pruning strategies, potentially resulting in picking a non-optimal solution.

It is worth noting, in particular, that Luo (2007), Denis and Baldridge (2007), and Finkel and Manning (2008) evaluate their approaches on true mentions extracted from the answer keys. $$$$$ In our experiments, we consider only the true ACE mentions.

Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Denis and Baldridge (2007) show that when used effectively, explicitly predicting anaphoricity can be helpful. $$$$$ To reduce such errors, Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Ng (2004) use an anaphoricity classifier –which has the sole task of saying whether or not any antecedents should be identified for each mention– as a filter for their coreference system.

We formulate our lexicon adaptation task using integer linear programming (ILP), which has been shown to bevery effective when solving problems with complex constraints (e.g., Roth and Yih (2004), Denis and Baldridge (2007)). $$$$$ Joint Determination of Anaphoricity and Coreference Resolution using Integer Programming

We present an ILP-based model of zero anaphora detection and resolution that builds on the joint determination of anaphoricity and coreference model proposed by Denis and Baldridge (2007), but revises it and extends it into a three-way ILP problem also incorporating subject detection. $$$$$ Joint Determination of Anaphoricity and Coreference Resolution using Integer Programming

Section 2 briefly summarizes the approach proposed by Denis and Baldridge (2007). $$$$$ The results in the previous section demonstrate the limitations of a cascading approach for determining anaphoricity and coreference with separate models.

Denis and Baldridge (2007) defined the following object function for the joint anaphoricity and coreference determination problem. $$$$$ The task for the anaphoricity determination component is the following: one wants to decide for each mention i in a document whether i is anaphoric or not.

Non-referential it detection should not be a pre-processing step, but rather part of a globally optimal configuration, as was done for general noun phrase anaphoricity by Denis and Baldridge (2007). $$$$$ In the first, intermediary step, we simply use ILP to find a global assignment based on decisions made by the coreference classifier alone.
Non-referential it detection should not be a pre-processing step, but rather part of a globally optimal configuration, as was done for general noun phrase anaphoricity by Denis and Baldridge (2007). $$$$$ The second step provides the joint formulation: the coreference classifier is now combined with an anaphoricity classifier and constraints are added to ensure that the ultimate coreference and anaphoricity decisions are mutually consistent.

Ranking models provide a theoretically more adequate and empirically better alternative approach to pronoun resolution than standard classification based approaches (Denis and Baldridge, 2007b). $$$$$ Standard pairwise coreference resolution systems are subject to errors resulting from their performing anaphora identification as an implicit part of coreference resolution.
Ranking models provide a theoretically more adequate and empirically better alternative approach to pronoun resolution than standard classification based approaches (Denis and Baldridge, 2007b). $$$$$ This is because our focus is on evaluating pairwise local approaches versus the global ILP approach rather than on building a full coreference resolution system.

By using joint inference for anaphoricity and coreference, Denis and Baldridge (2007a) avoid cascade-induced errors without the need to separately optimize the threshold. $$$$$ Joint Determination of Anaphoricity and Coreference Resolution using Integer Programming
By using joint inference for anaphoricity and coreference, Denis and Baldridge (2007a) avoid cascade-induced errors without the need to separately optimize the threshold. $$$$$ The anaphoricity classifier has an average accuracy of 80.2% on the three ACE datasets (using a threshold of .5).
