Following [Rambow and Korelsky, 1992], we call this additional planning task sentence planning (even though some operations may cross sentence boundaries). $$$$$ Therefore, in Joyce the task is performed by the sentence planner rather than the text planner'.

Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky,1992): the text planner has access only to information about communicative goals, the dis course context, and semantics, and generates a non-linguistic representation of text structure and content. $$$$$ Usually, the different tasks of text generation are divided among two modules (planning and realization), rather than three.

This paper addresses the area of text generation known as micro planning [Levelt 1989, Panaget 1994, Huang and Fiedler 1996], or sentence planning [Rambow and Korelsky 1992]. $$$$$ For example, McKeown's TEXT (McKeown 1985) performs the tasks that Joyce classifies as sentence planning as part of the realization process, whereas Meteer's SPOKESMAN (Meteer 1989) classifies them as part of text planning.

The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory: FoG (Kittredge and Polgu~re, 1991), LFS (Iordanskaja et al, 1992), and JOYCE (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992). $$$$$ While the current implementations of Joyce do not allow for parallel execution, the incremental processing of parallel computing tasks on a serial machine is also advantageous, as is argued in the WIP project (Wahlster et al 1991; Harbusch et al 1991)3.

The second approach is natural language generation (NLG), which customarily divides the generation process into three modules (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992): (1) Text Planning, (2) Sentence Planning, and (3) Surface Realization. $$$$$ Usually, the different tasks of text generation are divided among two modules (planning and realization), rather than three.
