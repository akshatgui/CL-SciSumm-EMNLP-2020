Following [Rambow and Korelsky, 1992], we call this additional planning task sentence planning (even though some operations may cross sentence boundaries). $$$$$ Therefore, in Joyce the task is performed by the sentence planner rather than the text planner'.

Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky,1992) $$$$$ Usually, the different tasks of text generation are divided among two modules (planning and realization), rather than three.
Tasks in the generation process have been divided into three stages (Rambow and Korelsky,1992) $$$$$ In Joyce, it is the text plan itself, i.e. the pre-linguistic representation of text content and structure, that is subject to revision.

This paper addresses the area of text generation known as micro planning [Levelt 1989, Panaget 1994, Huang and Fiedler 1996], or sentence planning [Rambow and Korelsky 1992]. $$$$$ For example, McKeown's TEXT (McKeown 1985) performs the tasks that Joyce classifies as sentence planning as part of the realization process, whereas Meteer's SPOKESMAN (Meteer 1989) classifies them as part of text planning.

The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory $$$$$ While the current implementations of Joyce do not allow for parallel execution, the incremental processing of parallel computing tasks on a serial machine is also advantageous, as is argued in the WIP project (Wahlster et al 1991; Harbusch et al 1991)3.
The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory $$$$$ The linguistic component is based on Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel'euk 1988), and is a reimplementation (in Lisp) of Polguere's Prolog implementation of a Meaning-Text model for English (Iordanskaja et al 1988; Iordanskaja et al 1991).

The second approach is natural language generation (NLG), which customarily divides the generation process into three modules (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) $$$$$ Usually, the different tasks of text generation are divided among two modules (planning and realization), rather than three.
