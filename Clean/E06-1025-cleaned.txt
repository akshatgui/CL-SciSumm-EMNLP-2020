We have also tested a more complex version of e, with ei scores obtained from release 1.0 of Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b). $$$$$ 5Several combinations of subparts of a WordNet gloss are tested as textual representations of terms in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).
We have also tested a more complex version of e, with ei scores obtained from release 1.0 of Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006b). $$$$$ Similarly to (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), our training set is obtained by expanding initial seed sets by means of WordNet lexical relations.

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ The approach we have proposed for determining term orientation (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) is described in more detail in Section 3, since it will be extensively used in this paper.
Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) used the method to cover objective (N) cases. $$$$$ In this paper we extend the method of (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) to the determination of term subjectivity and term orientation altogether.

These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ To aid the extraction of opinions from text, recent work has tackled the issue determining the “subjective” terms contained in text, i.e. deciding whether a term that carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation.
These terms and prior knowledge of their polarity could be used as features in a supervised classification framework to determine the sentiment of the opinionated text (E.g., (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006)). $$$$$ 1-of-m) classification.

Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ Kim and Hovy also report an evaluation of human inter-coder agreement.
Another evaluation resource (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) is resorted to in order to recover the evaluation values of all the hypernyms for a particular verb. $$$$$ We compare this evaluation with our results in Section 5.

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) did a classification experiment for creating lexica for opinion mining, for instance, and the importance of lexical information for event extraction in Biomedical texts has been addressed in Fillmore et al (2006). $$$$$ Determining Term Subjectivity And Term Orientation For Opinion Mining

Esuli and Sebastiani (2006) also address this problem testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method, and classify the input into positive, negative or neutral. $$$$$ We tackle this problem by testing three different variants of a semi-supervised method previously proposed for orientation detection.

The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ This is believed to be of key importance for identifying the orientation of documents, i.e. determining whether a document expresses a positive or negative opinion about its subject matter.
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). $$$$$ In the training phase of Approach II, the terms in TrKn ∪ TrKo are used as training examples of category (not Positive), and the terms in TrKp ∪ TrKo are used as training examples of category (not Negative).

Researchers have found this at various levels of analysis, including the manual annotation of phrases (Takamura et al, 2006), sentiment classification of phrases (Wilson et al, 2005), sentiment tagging of words (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006b), and sentiment tagging of word senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006a). $$$$$ Within opinion mining, several subtasks can be identified, all of them having to do with tagging a given document according to expressed opinion
