For MaltParser we used the projective Stack algorithm (Nivre, 2009) with default settings and a slightly enriched feature model. $$$$$ The minimal transition set Tp for projective dependency parsing contains three transitions

To deal with crossing arcs, Titov et al (2009) and Nivre (2009) designed a SWAP transition that switches the position of the two topmost nodes on the stack. $$$$$ In this paper, we will adopt a different strategy, suggested in recent work by Nivre (2008b) and Titov et al. (2009), and propose an algorithm that only combines adjacent substructures but derives non-projective trees by reordering the input words.

Despite this fact, it is possible to perform non-projective parsing in linear time in practice (Nivre, 2009). $$$$$ Non-Projective Dependency Parsing in Expected Linear Time
Despite this fact, it is possible to perform non-projective parsing in linear time in practice (Nivre, 2009). $$$$$ Even the best algorithms for deterministic parsing run in quadratic time, rather than linear (Nivre, 2008a), unless restricted to a subset of non-projective structures as in Attardi (2006) and Nivre (2007).

Note that Nivre (2009) has a similar idea of performing projective and non-projective parsing selectively. $$$$$ Non-Projective Dependency Parsing in Expected Linear Time

In this section, we start by defining a transition system for joint tagging and parsing based on the non-projective transition system proposed in Nivre (2009). $$$$$ As noted in section 2, the worst-case time complexity of a deterministic transition-based parser is given by an upper bound on the length of transition sequences.

Non-projective parsing algorithms for supervised dependency parsing have, for example, been presented in McDonald et al.

However, the goal of that transition is different from ours (selecting between projective and non-projective parsing, rather than building some arcs in advance) and the approach is specific to one algorithm while ours is generic for example, the LEFT ARC transition cannot be added to the arc-standard and arc-eager parsers, or to extensions of those like the ones by Attardi (2006) or Nivre (2009), because these already have it. $$$$$ The last column records the arc that is added to the arc set A in a given transition (if any).

Nivre (2009) introduced a transition based non projective parsing algorithm that has a worst case quadratic complexity and an expected linear parsing time. $$$$$ Hence, the complexity of deterministic parsing is O(n) in the worst case (as well as in the best case).
