The concept of compatible coverage vectors for the locations of translated words becomes the notion of reachability between frontier nodes in the lattice (Dyer et al, 2008). $$$$$ For example, assuming the third lattice in Figure 1 is our input, if the edge with word a is translated, this will cover two untranslated nodes [0,1] in the coverage vector, even though it is only a single word.
The concept of compatible coverage vectors for the locations of translated words becomes the notion of reachability between frontier nodes in the lattice (Dyer et al, 2008). $$$$$ In the sentence decoder, any translation of any span of untranslated words is an allowable extension of a partial translation hypothesis, provided that the coverage vectors of the extension and the partial hypothesis do not intersect.

We also plan to jointly optimize MT and name tagging by propagating multiple word segmentation and name annotation hypotheses in lattice structure to statistical MT and conduct lattice based decoding (Dyer et al, 2008). $$$$$ Chinese word segmentation.

In applications like the one described by Dyer et al (2008), where several different segmenters for Chinese are combined to create the lattice, this is not possible. $$$$$ Although the number of source phrases in a word lattice can be exponential in the number of nodes, enumerating the possible translations of every span in a lattice is in practice tractable, as described by Bertoldi et al. (2007).

Dyer et al (2008) use it to encode different Chinese word segmentations or Arabic morphological analyses. $$$$$ Dyer (2007) uses confusion networks to encode morphological alternatives in Czech-English translation, and Xu et al. (2005) takes an approach very similar to ours for Chinese-English translation and encodes multiple word segmentations in a lattice, but which is decoded with a conventionally trained translation model and without a sophisticated reordering model.

Our work differs from (Dyer et al, 2008) in that we explicitly distinguish the various preprocessing types in the lattice so that we can define specific path features and lexicalize the lattice path probabilities within the phrase model. $$$$$ In phrase based translation, distortion is modeled explicitly.

It was noted by Dyer et al (2008) that the standard distance-based reordering model needs to be redefined for lattice input. $$$$$ We present a description of the decoding process for a word lattice using a representative FST model, the phrase-based translation model described in Koehn et al. (2003).
It was noted by Dyer et al (2008) that the standard distance-based reordering model needs to be redefined for lattice input. $$$$$ Additionally, we have shown that although word lattices complicate modeling of word reordering, a simple heuristic offers good performance and enables many standard distortion models to be used directly with lattice input.

Using the shortest path within the lattice is reported to have better performance in (Dyer et al, 2008), however we did not implement it due to time constraints. $$$$$ Since this function is not dependent on the exact path chosen, it can be computed in advance of decoding using an allpairs shortest path algorithm (Cormen et al., 1989).

Recent studies have shown that SMT systems can benefit from widening the annotation pipeline $$$$$ The ‘noisier channel’ model of machine translation has been widely used in spoken language translation as an alternative to selecting the single-best hypothesis from an ASR system and translating it (Ney, 1999; Casacuberta et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; Saleem et al., 2005; Matusov et al., 2005; Bertoldi et al., 2007; Mathias, 2007).

Recently, several studies have shown that offering more alternatives of annotations to SMT systems will result in significant improvements, such as replacing 1-best trees with packed forests (Miet al, 2008) and replacing 1-best word segmentations with word lattices (Dyer et al, 2008). $$$$$ Today, virtually all statistical translation systems seek the best hypothesis e for a given input f in the source language, according to consider all possibilities for f by encoding the alternatives compactly as a confusion network or lattice (Bertoldi et al., 2007; Bertoldi and Federico, 2005; Koehn et al., 2007).
