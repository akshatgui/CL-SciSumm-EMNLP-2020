Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) used a similar data structure in their rule-based method. $$$$$ A method proposed by some researchers (Agarwal and Boggess 1992; Nagao et al. 1983) for selecting the correct structure is, in outline, that the two most similar components to the left side and to the right side of a conjunction are detected as two conjoined heads in a conjunctive structure.
Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) used a similar data structure in their rule-based method. $$$$$ This method uses a simple rule, instead of our dynamic programming method, that a KB depends on the most similar CB (calculated by the process in Section 3.1).

Popular parsers are Cabo Cha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), which we redeveloped to analyze formal written language expressions such as that in newspaper articles. $$$$$ Analysis of long sentences is one of the most difficult problems in natural language processing.

Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) proposed a method to detect conjunctive structures by calculating similarity scores between two sequences of bunsetsus. $$$$$ A computational method needs to recognize this subtle similarity in order to detect the correct conjunctive structures.
Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) proposed a method to detect conjunctive structures by calculating similarity scores between two sequences of bunsetsus. $$$$$ After that, we calculate the similarities between two series of bunsetsus on the left and right of the KB by combining the similarity scores for pairs of bunsetsus.

If the current modifier bunsetsu is a distinctive key bunsetsu (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994, page 510), these features are triggered. $$$$$ For all of these types, it is relatively easy to detect the presence of a CS by looking for a distinctive key bunsetsu (we call this a KB) that accompanies a word indicating a CS listed in Table 1 or has the renyoh forms (the underlined bunsetsus are KBs in Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao Syntactic Analysis Method Table 1).
If the current modifier bunsetsu is a distinctive key bunsetsu (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994, page 510), these features are triggered. $$$$$ That is, it is not easy to determine which bunsetsu to the left of a KB is the leftmost bunsetsu of the pre-conjunct (we call this starting bunsetsu SB) and which bunsetsu to the right of a KB is the rightmost bunsetsu of the post-conjunct (this ending bunsetsu is called EB and is a post-head).

 $$$$$ Our method detects the scope of a CS by finding the two series of bunsetsus from before and after the KB that have the greatest similarity.
 $$$$$ To make further progress in this field, we feel it is necessary to be able to take into consideration more possible interactions among a wider range of components of long sentences.

We first process them with the Japanese morphological analyzer, JUMAN (Kurohashi et al., 1994). $$$$$ In Japanese, the word preceding a conjunction is the pre-head, and the post-head that is most similar to the pre-head is searched for (Nagao et al. 1983) (see the upper part of Figure 1).

A similarity value between two bunsetsus is calculated on the basis of POS matching, exact word matching, and their semantic closeness in a thesaurus tree (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). $$$$$ Matching of the generic two layers is ignored to prevent too vague matching in a broader sense.
