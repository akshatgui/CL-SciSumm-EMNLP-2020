Since Brent (1993) a considerable amount of research focusing on large-scaled automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCF) has met with some success not only in English but also in many other languages. $$$$$ This paper presents a study in the automatic acquisition of lexical syntax from naturally occurring English text.
Since Brent (1993) a considerable amount of research focusing on large-scaled automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCF) has met with some success not only in English but also in many other languages. $$$$$ The scenario outlined above is adopted in this paper as a framework for basic research in computational language acquisition.

Apply some statistical tests such as the Binomial Hypothesis Test (Brent, 1993) and log likelihood ratio score (Dunning, 1993) to SCCs to filter out false SCCs on the basis of their reliability and likelihood. $$$$$ This precaution reduces the likelihood that a singular count noun will be mistaken for a verb, since singular count nouns are frequently preceded by a determiner.

We also experimented with a method suggested by Brent (1993) which applies the binomial test on frame frequency data. $$$$$ If the error probability 77-__s were known, then we could use the standard hypothesis testing method for binomial frequency data.

 $$$$$ The first column, titled V, represents the total number of times the word occurs in positions where it could be functioning as a verb.
 $$$$$ For easy reference by frame, all the symbols for a given frame are aligned in one column.

Since (Brent 1993) began to use the method, most researchers have agreed that the BHT results in better precision and recall with SCF hypotheses of high, medium and low frequencies. $$$$$ Each estimate j of Jo is evaluated by comparing the predicted distribution in the first j bins to the observed distributionâ€”the better the fit, the better the estimate.
Since (Brent 1993) began to use the method, most researchers have agreed that the BHT results in better precision and recall with SCF hypotheses of high, medium and low frequencies. $$$$$ Overall the tradeoff between improved precision and reduced recall seems quite good, as compared to doing no noise reduction (p_s --= 0).

(Brent 1993) estimated pe according to the acquisition system's performance. $$$$$ Each row shows the performance of the hypothesis-testing procedure for a different estimate p_s of the error-rate 7r_s.
(Brent 1993) estimated pe according to the acquisition system's performance. $$$$$ In fact, the estimated error rate for infinitives produces a better classification than any of those shown in Table 7.

Following studies on automatic SCF extraction (Brent, 1993), we apply a statistical test (Binomial Hypothesis Test) to the unfiltered-Levin-SCF to filter out noisy SCFs, and denote the resulting SCF set as filtered-Levin SCF. $$$$$ 3.1.1 Binomial Frequency Data.

Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993). $$$$$ Most work on corpora of naturally occurring language either uses no a priori grammatical knowledge (Brill and Marcus 1992; Ellison 1991; Finch and Chater 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992), or else it relies on a large and complex grammar (Hindle 1990, 1991).
Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993). $$$$$ Moving from coins to verbs, the procedure works as follows.

Our evaluator has two parts: the Binomial Hypothesis Test (Brent, 1993) and a back-off algorithm (Sarkar and Zeman, 2000). $$$$$ The basic approach is hypothesis testing on binomial frequency data (Kalbfleisch 1985).

The final component assesses the frames encountered by the parser by using the same model as (Brent, 1993), with the error rate set empirically. $$$$$ As a result, using the -ed forms would have complicated the statistical model substantially.
The final component assesses the frames encountered by the parser by using the same model as (Brent, 1993), with the error rate set empirically. $$$$$ Rather, it seems that significant lexical syntactic information can be recovered using a few approximate cues along with statistical inference based on a simple model of the cues' error distributions.

(Brent, 1993) relies on local morphosyntactic cues (such as the -ing suffix, except where such a word follows a determiner or a preposition other than to) in the untagged Brown Corpus as probabilistic indicators of six different predefined subcategorisation frames. $$$$$ Second, treat these cues as probabilistic rather than absolute indicators of syntactic structure.

(Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) observe that in the work of (Brent, 1993), (Manning, 1993) and (Ushioda et al, 1993), the maximum number of distinct sub categorization classes recognized is sixteen, and only Ushioda et al attempt to derive relative subcategorization frequency for individual predicates. $$$$$ How can easily recognized, surface grammatical facts be used to extract from a corpus as much syntactic information as possible about individual words?

In his seminal work, Brent (1993) already pointed out that the cues occur in contexts that were not aimed at. $$$$$ Further, these cues occur fairly often in structures other than those they are designed to detect.
In his seminal work, Brent (1993) already pointed out that the cues occur in contexts that were not aimed at. $$$$$ Since the cues are not perfect, such verbs do occur with cues for S. The problem is to determine when a verb occurs with cues for S often enough that all those occurrences are unlikely to be errors.

(Brent, 1993) uses regular patterns. $$$$$ Use a statistical model to determine whether the cooccurrence of a verb with cues for a frame is too regular to be explained by randomly distributed exceptions.
(Brent, 1993) uses regular patterns. $$$$$ Similar characteristic patterns exist for words that occur primarily as adjectives.

Thus, Brent (1993) only creates hypotheses on the basis of instances of verb frames that are reliably and unambiguously cued by closed class items (such as pronouns) so there can be no other attachment possibilities. $$$$$ If sentences cannot be parsed completely and reliably then the syntactic frames used in them cannot be determined reliably.
Thus, Brent (1993) only creates hypotheses on the basis of instances of verb frames that are reliably and unambiguously cued by closed class items (such as pronouns) so there can be no other attachment possibilities. $$$$$ Because pronouns like him almost never take relative clauses, and because pronouns are known at the outset, Lerner concludes that the clause beginning with that the is probably an argument of the verb tell.'

The foundational work of (Brent, 1993) was based on plain text (2.6 million words of the Wall StreetJournal (WSJ, 1994)). $$$$$ This paper describes an approach based on two principles.
