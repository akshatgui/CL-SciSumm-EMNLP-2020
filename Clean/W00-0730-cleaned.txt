Even with a more feasible method, pairwise (Kreel, 1998), which is employed in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000), we can not train a classifier in a reasonable time, because we have a large number of samples that belong to the non-entity class in this formulation. $$$$$ In the field of natural language processing, SVMs are applied to text categorization, and are reported to have achieved high accuracy without falling into over-fitting even with a large number of words taken as the features (Joachims, 1998; Taira and Haruno, 1999) First of all, let us define the training data which belongs to either positive or negative class as follows
