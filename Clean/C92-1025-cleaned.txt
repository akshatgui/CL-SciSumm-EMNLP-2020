It was observed somewhere around 1990 at Xerox that the rule sets may be composed with the lexicon transducers in an efficient way and that the resulting transducer was roughly similar in size as the lexicon transducer itself (Karttunen et al, 1992). $$$$$ For efficient recognition and generation, the resulting cascade can be reduced to a single transducer.
