This approach is practical for geographic names, for which broad-coverage gazetteers exist, though less so for personal names (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003). $$$$$ However, in the specialized case of personal names, there is more precise information available.

Successful feature extensions to the VSM for cross-document coreference have included biographical information (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) and syntactic context (Chen and Martin, 2007). $$$$$ For the task of extracting biographical information, each example would include the personal name and the biographic feature.
Successful feature extensions to the VSM for cross-document coreference have included biographical information (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) and syntactic context (Chen and Martin, 2007). $$$$$ For example, if 1756 is extracted as a birth year from a syntactic-based pattern for the polysemous name, then whenever 1756 is observed anywhere in context (outside an extraction pattern), it is given a higher weighting and added to the document vector as a potential biographic feature.

The training set contains the top 100 web search results of 49 names from the Web03 corpus (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003), Wikipedia and European Conference on Digital Library (ECDL) participants; the test data are comprised of the top 100 documents of 30 names from Wikipedia, US Census and ACL participants. $$$$$ The set was constructed by retrieving 100 web pages, and then labeling the pages with respect to their referent.

Mann and Yarowsky (2003) have proposed a Web based clustering technique relying on a feature space combining biographic facts and associated names, whereas Bagga and Baldwin (1998) have looked for co reference chains within each document, take the context of these chains for creating summaries about each entity and convert these summaries into a bag of words. $$$$$ The approach utilizes an unsupervised clustering technique over a rich feature space of biographic facts, which are automatically extracted via a language-independent bootstrapping process.

Clustering approaches (e.g. hierarchical agglomerative clustering (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003)) have been commonly used for CDC due to the variety of data distributions of different names. $$$$$ The cluster method we employed is bottom-up centroid agglomerative clustering.

Our work goes beyond the simple co-occurrence features (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and the limited extracted information (e.g. biographical information in (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) that is relatively scarce in web data) using the broad range of relational information with the support of information extraction tools. $$$$$ In particular, information extraction techniques can add high precision, categorical information such as approximate age/date-of-birth, nationality and occupation.

This final similarity function will then be embedded into a normal HAC algorithm to group the web pages into different namesakes where we compute the centroid-based distance between clusters (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003). $$$$$ To assess similarity between vectors we utilized standard cosine similarity (cos(a, b) = a·b
