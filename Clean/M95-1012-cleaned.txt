In addition to these finite state pattern approaches, a variant of Brill rules has been applied to the problem, as outlined in (Aberdeen et al, 1995). $$$$$ As noted above, it has somewhat less recognition power than a finite-state machine, and as such shares many characteristics of pattern-matching systems, such as CIRCUS [10] or FASTUS [2] .
In addition to these finite state pattern approaches, a variant of Brill rules has been applied to the problem, as outlined in (Aberdeen et al, 1995). $$$$$ After all of the rules have been applied, the phraser is done.

The typical machine learning approaches for English NE are transformation-based learning [Aberdeen et al 1995]. $$$$$ Learning Phrase Rules We have applied the same general error-reduction learning approach that Brill designed for generating part-of-speech rules to the problem of learning phraser rules in support of the NE task.

Each document in the collection to be summarized is processed by a sentence tokenizer, the Alembic part-of-speech tagger (Aberdeen et al 1995). $$$$$ Prior to the part-of-speech tagger, however, a text to be processed by Alembic passes through severa l preprocess stages ; each preprocessor "enriches" the text by means of SGML tags .
Each document in the collection to be summarized is processed by a sentence tokenizer, the Alembic part-of-speech tagger (Aberdeen et al 1995). $$$$$ The following, for example , is how a sample walkthrough sentence is passed to the part-of-speech tagger.

Many research groups are making progress toward efficient customization, such as BBN (Weischedel, 1995), NYU (Grishman, 1995), SRI (Appelt et al, 1995), SRA (Krupka, 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen et al, 1995), UMass (Fisher et al, 1995) ... etc. $$$$$ Aside from this theoretical bound on computation, we have found in practice that th e inference system is remarkably fast, with semantic interpretation, equality reasoning, rule application, and al l other aspects of inference together accounting for 6-7% of all processing time in Alembic.
