The problem of low counts (i.e. linguistic patterns that were never, or rarely found) has not been analyzed appropriately inmost papers, as convincingly demonstrated in [Dunning, 1993]. $$$$$ Tile convergence of the log of the likelihood ratio to the asymptotic distribution is demonstrated dramatically in Figure 4.

Since then, a variety of statistical methods have been proposed to measure bi-gram association, such as Log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993). $$$$$ The likelihood ratio for this test is where Taking the logarithm of the likelihood ratio gives —21og A -= 2 [log L (pi , , ni) + log Up2 , k2 , n2) — log L(p, , ni) — log L(p,k2, n2)] • For the multinomial case, it is convenient to use the double subscripts and the abbreviations This expression implicitly involves n because E119 = n. Maximizing and taking the logarithm, —21og A = 2 [log L (Pi , ) + log L (P2, K2) — log L(Q, ) — log L (Q, K2)1 where If the null hypothesis holds, then the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically X2 distributed with k/2 — 1 degrees of freedom.

The likelihood ratio tests (Dunning, 1993) is used for this purpose. $$$$$ Likelihood ratio tests are based on the idea that statistical hypotheses can be said to specify subspaces of the space described by the unknown parameters of the statistical model being used.
The likelihood ratio tests (Dunning, 1993) is used for this purpose. $$$$$ As will be seen, the ranking based on likelihood ratio tests does exactly this.

Each element of the resulting vector was replaced with its log-likelihood value (see Definition 10 in Section 2.3) which can be considered as an estimate of how surprising or distinctive a co-occurrence pair is (Dunning, 1993). $$$$$ The likelihood ratio for a hypothesis is the ratio of the maximum value of the likelihood function over the subspace represented by the hypothesis to the maximum value of the likelihood function over the entire parameter space.

Many previous studies have shown that the log-likelihood ratio is well suited for this purpose (Dunning, 1993). $$$$$ The likelihood ratio for this test is where Taking the logarithm of the likelihood ratio gives —21og A -= 2 [log L (pi , , ni) + log Up2 , k2 , n2) — log L(p, , ni) — log L(p,k2, n2)] • For the multinomial case, it is convenient to use the double subscripts and the abbreviations This expression implicitly involves n because E119 = n.

It can be expected that the log-likelihood ratio produces an accurate ranking of word pairs that highly correlates with human judgment (Dunning, 1993), although there are other measures which come close in performance (e.g. Rapp, 1998). $$$$$ The close agreement shows that the likelihood ratio measure produces accurate results over six decades of significance even in the range where the normal X2 measure diverges radically from the ideal.

It is known that PMI gives undue importance to low frequency events (Dunning, 1993), therefore the evaluation considers only pairs of genes that occur at least 5 times in the whole corpus. $$$$$ For example, simple word counts made on a moderate-sized corpus show that words that have a frequency of less than one in 50,000 words make up about 20-30% of typical English language news-wire reports.

The measures2 - Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1989), the log-likelihood ratio test (Dunning, 1993), two statistical tests $$$$$ Such a test is called parametric.

For instance, there is a widely held belief that and are inferior to other measures because they overestimate the collocativity of low-frequency candidates (cf. the remarks on the chi square measure in (Dunning, 1993)). $$$$$ This comparison is possible because the measure described in this paper has better asymptotic behavior than more traditional measures.

We tried two feature reduction methods $$$$$ These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms.

The LLR measurement measures stochastic dependency between two such random variables (Dunning, 1993), and is known to be equal to Mutual Information that is linearly scaled by the size of the corpus (Moore, 2004). $$$$$ The assumption that simple functions of the random variables being sampled are distributed normally or approximately normally underlies many common statistical tests.

As an alternative for determining the probability of a positive association using P (PMI& gt; 0), we calculate LLR and assume that approximately LLR with one degree of freedom (Dunning, 1993). $$$$$ When j is 2 (the binomial), —2 log A will be X2 distributed with one degree of freedom.

Many statistical metrics have been proposed, including point wise mutual information (MI) (Church et al 1990), mean and variance, hypothesis testing (t-test, chi square test, etc.), log-likelihood ratio (LR) (Dunning, 1993),statistic language model (Tomokiyo, et al 2003), and so on. $$$$$ The second approach is typified by much of the work of Gale and Church (Gale and Church this issue, and in press; Church et al. 1989).

Given a contextual word cw that occurs in the paragraphs of bc, a log-likelihood ratio (G2) test is employed (Dunning, 1993), which checks if the distribution of cw in bc is similar to the distribution of cw in rc. $$$$$ This distribution is most commonly either the normal or X2 distribution.

Dunning (1993) gives the formula for the statistic we are calling G2 in a form that is very compact, but not necessarily the most illuminating. $$$$$ The task of counting words can be cast into the form of a repeated sequence of such binary trials comparing each word in a text with the word being counted.
