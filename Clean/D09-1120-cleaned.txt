In general, coreference errors in state-of-the art systems are frequently due to poor models of semantic compatibility (Haghighi and Klein, 2009). $$$$$ Overall, we conclude that our system outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised systems12 and is in the range of the state-of-the art systems of Culotta et al. (2007) and Bengston and Roth (2008).
In general, coreference errors in state-of-the art systems are frequently due to poor models of semantic compatibility (Haghighi and Klein, 2009). $$$$$ There are several general trends to the errors made by our system.

In addition to the above, if a mention is in a deterministic coreference configuration, as defined in Haghighi and Klein (2009), we force it to take the required antecedent. $$$$$ The required lexical pattern X who served as Y is a general appositive-like pattern that almost surely indicates coreference.
In addition to the above, if a mention is in a deterministic coreference configuration, as defined in Haghighi and Klein (2009), we force it to take the required antecedent. $$$$$ Each row is a mention type and the column the predicted mention type antecedent.

For r, we use a deterministic entity assignment Zr, similar to the Haghighi and Klein (2009)'s SYN-CONSTR setting: each referring mention is coreferent with any past mention with the same head or in a deterministic syntactic configuration (appositives or predicative nominatives constructions). $$$$$ Syntactic constraints like the binding theory, the i-within-i filter, and appositive constructions restrict reference by configuration.

 $$$$$ A common error arose from the use of mention head distance as a poor proxy for discourse salience.
 $$$$$ Nonetheless, our coreference system, despite being relatively simple and having no tunable parameters or complexity beyond the non-reference complexity of its component modules, manages to outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised coreference resolution and be broadly comparable to state-of-the-art supervised systems.

All systems except Haghighi and Klein (2009) and current work are fully supervised. $$$$$ Despite its simplicity and discourse naivete, our system substantially outperforms all unsupervised systems and most supervised ones.
All systems except Haghighi and Klein (2009) and current work are fully supervised. $$$$$ This procedure is trivial where most systems are rich, and so does not need any supervised coreference data.

We also compared to the strong deterministic system of Haghighi and Klein (2009). $$$$$ Some of these paths can be ruled in or out by deterministic but conservative syntactic constraints.

Haghighi and Klein (2009) reports on true mentions; here, we report performance on automatically detected mentions. $$$$$ In this section we develop our system and report developmental results on ACE2004-ROTHDEV (see Section 2.1); we report pairwise F1 figures here, but report on many more evaluation metrics in Section 4.
Haghighi and Klein (2009) reports on true mentions; here, we report performance on automatically detected mentions. $$$$$ The closest (in tree distance, see Section 3.1.1) compatible mention is The Israelis, which is correct particular, this fixes examples such as those in Figure 1 where the true antecedent has many embedded mentions between itself and the pronoun.

We compared our output to the deterministic system of Haghighi and Klein (2009). $$$$$ Instead, we consider a vastly more modular system in which coreference is predicted from a deterministic function of a few rich features.

The news have been processed with a tokenizer, a sentence splitter (Gillick and Favre, 2009), a part-of-speech tagger and dependency parser (Nivre, 2006), a co-reference resolution module (Haghighi and Klein, 2009) and an entity linker based on Wikipedia and Freebase (Milneand Witten, 2008). $$$$$ The resolution of entity reference is influenced by a variety of constraints.

Specifically, when searching for an antecedent for mk, its candidate antecedents are visited in an order determined by their positions in the associated parse tree (Haghighi and Klein, 2009). $$$$$ Mapping Mentions to Parse Nodes: In order to use the syntactic position of mentions to determine anaphoricity, we must associate each mention in the document with a parse tree node.
Specifically, when searching for an antecedent for mk, its candidate antecedents are visited in an order determined by their positions in the associated parse tree (Haghighi and Klein, 2009). $$$$$ Now that each mention is situated in a parse tree, we utilize the length of the shortest tree path between mentions as our notion of distance.

For Chinese, we handle role appositives as introduced by Haghighi and Klein (2009) analogously. $$$$$ Role Appositives: During development, we discovered many errors which involved a variant of appositives which we call ‘role appositives’ (see painter in Figure 3), where an NP modifying the head NP describes the role of that entity (typically a person entity).
For Chinese, we handle role appositives as introduced by Haghighi and Klein (2009) analogously. $$$$$ There are several challenges to correctly labeling these role NPs as being appositives.

This was what (Haghighi and Klein, 2009) did and we did this in training with the REUTERS corpus (Hasler et al, 2006) in which syntactic roles are annotated. $$$$$ Importantly, the bulk of the work in the syntactic module is in making sure the parses are correctly constructed and used, and this module’s most important training data is a treebank.

The other systems we compare to and outperform are the perceptron-based Reconcile system of Stoyanov et al (2009), the strong deterministic system of Haghighi and Klein (2009), and the cluster-ranking model of Rahman and Ng (2009). $$$$$ While much research (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Culotta et al., 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Poon and Domingos, 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008) has explored how to reconcile pairwise decisions to form coherent clusters, we simply take the transitive closure of our pairwise decision (as in Ng and Cardie (2002) and Bengston and Roth (2008)) which can and does cause system errors.
