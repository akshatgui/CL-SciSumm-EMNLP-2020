These vector representations capture interesting linear relationships (up to some accuracy), such as king-man+woman=queen (Mikolov et al, 2013). $$$$$ For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40% of the questions.

However, not only are these techniques intractable to train with high-order context vectors, they also lack the neural network's ability to semantically generalize (Mikolov et al, 2013) and learn nonlinear relationships. $$$$$ A defining feature of neural network language models is their representation of words as high dimensional real valued vectors.

Note however that, because of the way the task is framed, performance also depends on the size of the vocabulary to be searched $$$$$ In these models (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010), words are converted via a learned lookuptable into real valued vectors which are used as the inputs to a neural network.
Note however that, because of the way the task is framed, performance also depends on the size of the vocabulary to be searched $$$$$ The systems were trained with 320M words of Broadcast News data as described in (Mikolov et al., 2011a), and had an 82k vocabulary.

 $$$$$ We also evaluate semantic generalization on the SemEval 2012 task, and outperform the previous state-of-the-art.
 $$$$$ Surprisingly, both results are the byproducts of an unsupervised maximum likelihood training criterion that simply operates on a large amount of text data.

Word embeddings have been empirically shown to preserve linguistic regularities, such as the semantic relationship between words (Mikolov et al, 2013b). $$$$$ Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations
Word embeddings have been empirically shown to preserve linguistic regularities, such as the semantic relationship between words (Mikolov et al, 2013b). $$$$$ Specifically, the regularities are observed as constant vector offsets between pairs of words sharing a particular relationship.

More recently, Mikolov et al (2013a) propose two log-linear models, namely the Skip-gram and CBOW model, to efficiently induce word embeddings. $$$$$ As pointed out by the original proposers, one of the main advantages of these models is that the distributed representation achieves a level of generalization that is not possible with classical n-gram language models; whereas a n-gram model works in terms of discrete units that have no inherent relationship to one another, a continuous space model works in terms of word vectors where similar words are likely to have similar vectors.

Mikolov et al (2013b) observe that word embeddings preserve interesting linguistic regularities, capturing a considerable amount of syntactic/semantic relations. $$$$$ We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset.

The word vectors we use are from Mikolov et al (2013) 13 (Mikolov13), and additional results are also shown using Turian et al (2010) 14 (Turian10). $$$$$ These models were first studied in the context of feed-forward networks (Bengio et al., 2003; Bengio et al., 2006), and later in the context of recurrent neural network models (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2011b).

Mikolov et al (2013b) show that pre-trained embeddings can capture interesting semantic and syntactic information such as king-man+woman=queen on English data. $$$$$ For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40% of the questions.

These are precisely the kinds of distinctions between determiners that state-splitting in the Berkeley parser has shown to be useful (Petrov and Klein, 2007), and existing work (Mikolov et al., 2013b) has observed that such regular embedding structure extends to many other parts of speech. $$$$$ In these models (Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010), words are converted via a learned lookuptable into real valued vectors which are used as the inputs to a neural network.

Among the state-of-the-art word embedding methods is the skip-gram with negative sampling model (SKIPGRAM), introduced by Mikolov et al (2013b) and implemented in the word2vec software. $$$$$ 2 In Table 3 we compare the RNN vectors with those based on the methods of Collobert and Weston (2008) and Mnih and Hinton (2009), as implemented by (Turian et al., 2010) and available online 3 Since different words are present in these datasets, we computed the intersection of the vocabularies of the RNN vectors and the new vectors, and restricted the test set and word vectors to those.
