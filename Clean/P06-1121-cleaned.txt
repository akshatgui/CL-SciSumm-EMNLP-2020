If we analyze these three models in terms of expressive power, the Galley et al (2006) model is more expressive than the SPMT models, which in turn, are more expressive than Chiang's model. $$$$$ For this, we need a formalism that is expressive enough to deal with cases of syntactic divergence between source and target languages (Fox, 2002)

The xRS formalism utilized by Galley et al (2006) allows for the use of translation rules that have multi-level target tree annotations and discontinuous source language phrases. $$$$$ The overall goal of our translation system is to transform a given source-language sentence f into an appropriate translation e in the set E of all possible target-language sentences.

Syntax-driven (Galley et al, 2006) and hierarchical translation models (Chiang, 2005) take advantage of probabilistic synchronous context free grammars (PSCFGs) to represent structured, lexical reordering constraints during the decoding process. $$$$$ With the notable exception of Poutsma, most related works rely on models that are restricted to synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG).While the state-of-the-art hierarchical SMT system (Chiang, 2005) performs well despite stringent constraints imposed on its context-free gram mar, we believe its main advantage lies in its ability to extract hierarchical rules across phrasal boundaries.
Syntax-driven (Galley et al, 2006) and hierarchical translation models (Chiang, 2005) take advantage of probabilistic synchronous context free grammars (PSCFGs) to represent structured, lexical reordering constraints during the decoding process. $$$$$ Context-free grammars (such as PennTreebank and Chiang?s grammars) make independence assumptions that are arguably often unrea sonable, but as our work suggests, relaxations of these assumptions by using contextually richer rules results in translations of increasing quality.

(Galley et al, 2006) use syntactic constituents for the PSCFG nonterminal set and (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) take advantage of CCG (Steedman, 1999) categories, while (Chiang, 2005) uses a single generic nonterminal. $$$$$ and use p(?)

Similarly, the tree-to-string syntax-based transduction approach offers a complete translation framework (Galley et al, 2006). $$$$$ Syn tactic approaches seek to remedy these problems.In this paper, we take the framework for acquiring multi-level syntactic translation rules of (Gal ley et al, 2004) from aligned tree-string pairs, and present two main extensions of their approach

For example, Galley et al (2004) initially built a syntax-based system using only minimal rules, and subsequently reported (Galley et al, 2006) that composing rules improves Bleu by 3.6 points, while increasing grammar size 60-fold and decoding time 15-fold. $$$$$ Finally, we show that our contextually richer rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over those of (Galley et al, 2004).

Galley et al (2006 )argued that breaking a single tree pair into multiple decompositions is important for correct probability modeling. $$$$$ We contrast our work with (Galley et al, 2004), highlight some severe limitations of probability estimates computed from single derivations, and demonstrate that it is critical to account for many derivations for each sentence pair.
