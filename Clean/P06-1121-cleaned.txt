If we analyze these three models in terms of expressive power, the Galley et al (2006) model is more expressive than the SPMT models, which in turn, are more expressive than Chiang's model. $$$$$ For this, we need a formalism that is expressive enough to deal with cases of syntactic divergence between source and target languages (Fox, 2002): for any given (pi, f ,a) triple, it is useful to produce a derivationthat minimally explains the transformation be tween pi and f , while remaining consistent with a. Galley et al (2004) present one such formalism (henceforth ?GHKM?).

The xRS formalism utilized by Galley et al (2006) allows for the use of translation rules that have multi-level target tree annotations and discontinuous source language phrases. $$$$$ The overall goal of our translation system is to transform a given source-language sentence f into an appropriate translation e in the set E of all possible target-language sentences.

Syntax-driven (Galley et al, 2006) and hierarchical translation models (Chiang, 2005) take advantage of probabilistic synchronous context free grammars (PSCFGs) to represent structured, lexical reordering constraints during the decoding process. $$$$$ With the notable exception of Poutsma, most related works rely on models that are restricted to synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG).While the state-of-the-art hierarchical SMT system (Chiang, 2005) performs well despite stringent constraints imposed on its context-free gram mar, we believe its main advantage lies in its ability to extract hierarchical rules across phrasal boundaries.

Similarly, the tree-to-string syntax-based transduction approach offers a complete translation framework (Galley et al, 2006). $$$$$ Syn tactic approaches seek to remedy these problems.In this paper, we take the framework for acquiring multi-level syntactic translation rules of (Gal ley et al, 2004) from aligned tree-string pairs, and present two main extensions of their approach: first, instead of merely computing a single derivation that minimally explains a sentence pair, we constructa large number of derivations that include contextually richer rules, and account for multiple interpretations of unaligned words.

Galley et al (2006 )argued that breaking a single tree pair into multiple decompositions is important for correct probability modeling. $$$$$ We contrast our work with (Galley et al, 2004), highlight some severe limitations of probability estimates computed from single derivations, and demonstrate that it is critical to account for many derivations for each sentence pair.
