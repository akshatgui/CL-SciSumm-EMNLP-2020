In the case of English, partially motivated by Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), a number of coreference resolution methods have been proposed. $$$$$ This paper looks briefly at the history of these Conferences and then examines the considerations which led to the structure of MUC-6} The Message Understanding Conferences were initiated by NOSC to assess and to foster research on the automated analysis of military messages containing textual information.
In the case of English, partially motivated by Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), a number of coreference resolution methods have been proposed. $$$$$ Although called "conferences", the distinguishing characteristic of the MUCs are not the conferences themselves, but the evaluations to which participants must submit in order to be permitted to attend the conference.

A condition of attending the MUC workshops was participation in a required evaluation (bakeoff) task of filling slots in templates about events, and began (after an exploratory MUC-1 in 1987) with MUC-2 in 1989, followed by MUC-3 (1991), MUC-4 (1992), MUC-5 (1993) and MUC 6 (1995) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). $$$$$ By MUC-2 (1989), the task had crystalized as one of template filling.

There have been a very large number of NE tagger implementations since this task was introduced at MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). $$$$$ DARPA has a number of information science and technol- ogy programs which are driven in large part, by regular evaluations.
There have been a very large number of NE tagger implementations since this task was introduced at MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). $$$$$ The joint venture task re- quired 11 templates with a total of 47 slots for the output double tile number of slots defined for MUC-4  and the task documentation was over 40 pages long.

The automated construction of semantically typed lexicons (terms classified into their appropriate semantic class) from unstructured text is of great importance for various kinds of information extraction (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), question answering (Moldovan et al, 1999), and ontology population (Suchanek et al, 2007). $$$$$ One re- ceives a description of a class of events to be iden- tiffed in the text; for each of these events one must fill a template with information about the event.

As demonstrated by prior work (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), grammar-based IE systems can be effective in many scenarios. $$$$$ The goal for scenar io  templates  mini- MUC - -  was to demonstrate that effective infor- mation extraction systems could be created in a few weeks.

When it was introduced, in the 6th Message Understanding Conference (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), the named entity recognition task comprised three entity identification and labeling subtasks $$$$$ To meet this goal the con> mittce developed the "named entity" task, which t(asically involves identifying the names of all the people, organizations, and geographic locations in a text.

The problem of name recognition and classification has been intensively studied since 1995, when it was introduced as part of the MUC 6 Evaluation (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). $$$$$ MUC-6 introduced sev- eral innovations over prior MUCs, most notably in the range of different asks for which evaluations were conducted.
The problem of name recognition and classification has been intensively studied since 1995, when it was introduced as part of the MUC 6 Evaluation (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996). $$$$$ The second MUC also worked out the details of the primary evaluation measures, recall and pre- cision.

 $$$$$ The PERSON and ORGANIZATION templates are the "temt)late lement" templates, which are invariant across scenarios.

In a previous attempt to define predicate-argument structure, Semeval, the effort was abandoned because so many constructs would require detailed attention and resolution, and because most information-extraction systems did not generate full predicate-argument structures (most likely because the task did not require it) (Grishmanand Sundheim, 1996). $$$$$ Systems did particularly poorly in identifying descriptions; the highest-scoring system had 38% recall and 51% precision for descriptions.

Since the introduction of this task in MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), numerous systems using various ways of exploiting entity-specific and local context features were proposed, from relatively simple character based models such as Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) and Klein et al (2003) to complex models making use of various lexical, syntactic ,morpho logical, and orthographical information, such as Wacholder et al (1997), Fleischman and Hovy (2002), and Florian et al (2003). $$$$$ The old-style MUC information extraction task, based on a description of a particular (

We used 6 categories of entity types, which are the major categories defined in the MUC (Grishman and Sundheim 1996) or ACE project (ACE homepage). $$$$$ The tag ENAMEX ("entity name expression") is used for both people and organiza- tion names; the tag NUNEX ( "numer ic  expression") is used for currency and I)ercentages.
