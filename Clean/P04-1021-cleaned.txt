Li et al (2004) presented a framework allowing direct orthographical mapping of transliteration units be tween English and Chinese, and an extended model is presented in Ekbal et al (2006). $$$$$ This paper presents a new framework that allows direct orthographical mapping (DOM) between two different languages, through a joint source-channel model, also transliteration model (TM). the TM model, we automate the orthographic alignment process to derive the aligned transliteration units from bilingual dictionary.

One Chinese Pinyin string can correspond to several Chinese characters (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ Therefore, any foreign name will have only one Pinyin (romanization of Chinese) and thus in Chinese characters.
One Chinese Pinyin string can correspond to several Chinese characters (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ 2) Suppose that language dependent graphemeto-phoneme systems are attainable, obtaining Chinese orthography will need two further steps

For this reason, it has been reported that English-to-Chinese transliteration without Chinese phonemes outperforms that with Chinese phonemes (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ Therefore, any foreign name will have only one Pinyin (romanization of Chinese) and thus in Chinese characters.
For this reason, it has been reported that English-to-Chinese transliteration without Chinese phonemes outperforms that with Chinese phonemes (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ Therefore, we refer all foreign-Chinese transliteration to English-Chinese transliteration, or E2C.

We performed alignment between E G and E P and between E P and C P in a similar manner presented in Li et al (2004). $$$$$ In machine transliteration, the noisy channel model (NCM), based on a phoneme-based approach, has recently received considerable attention (Meng et al. 2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga & Khudanpur, 2003; Knight & Graehl, 1998).

The grapheme-based approach, also known as direct orthographical mapping (Li et al, 2004), which treats transliteration as a statistical machine translation problem under monotonic constraints, has also achieved promising results. $$$$$ The transliteration is usually achieved through intermediate phonemic mapping.

Phoneme-based approaches are usually not good enough, because name entities have various etymological origins and transliterations are not always decided by pronunciations (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ In machine transliteration, the noisy channel model (NCM), based on a phoneme-based approach, has recently received considerable attention (Meng et al. 2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga & Khudanpur, 2003; Knight & Graehl, 1998).
Phoneme-based approaches are usually not good enough, because name entities have various etymological origins and transliterations are not always decided by pronunciations (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ However, the phoneme-based approaches are limited by two major constraints, which could compromise transliterating precision, especially in English-Chinese transliteration

Li et al (2004) propose a letter-to-letter n-gram transliteration model for Chinese-English transliteration in an attempt to allow for the encoding of more contextual information. $$$$$ In view of the close coupling of the source and target transliteration units, we propose to estimate P(E,C) by a joint source-channel model, or n-gram transliteration model (TM).

Many transliterated words are proper names, whose pronunciation rules may vary depending on the language of origin (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ Proper names of English, French, German, Russian, Spanish and Arabic origins constitute a good portion of out-of-vocabulary words.
Many transliterated words are proper names, whose pronunciation rules may vary depending on the language of origin (Li et al, 2004). $$$$$ For example, /Lafontant/ is transliterated into 拉丰唐(La-FengTang) while /Constant/ becomes 康斯坦特(KangSi-Tan-Te) , where syllable /-tant/ in the two names are transliterated differently depending on the names’ language of origin.

So grapheme-based (Li et al, 2004) approach has gained lots of attention recently. $$$$$ Several phoneme-based techniques have been proposed in the recent past for machine transliteration using transformation-based learning algorithm (Meng et al. 2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga & Khudanpur, 2003) and using finite state transducer that implements transformation rules (Knight & Graehl, 1998), where both handcrafted and data-driven transformation rules have been studied.

Direct orthographic mapping (e.g. Li et al, 2004), making use of individual Chinese graphemes, tends to overcome the problem and model the character choice directly. $$$$$ This paper presents a new framework that allows direct orthographical mapping (DOM) between two different languages, through a joint source-channel model, also transliteration model (TM). the TM model, we automate the orthographic alignment process to derive the aligned transliteration units from bilingual dictionary.
