The main part of our dependency parser is based on Nivre' s algorithm (Nivre, 2004), in which the dependency relations are constructed by a bottom up deterministic schema. $$$$$ Incrementality In Deterministic Dependency Parsing
The main part of our dependency parser is based on Nivre' s algorithm (Nivre, 2004), in which the dependency relations are constructed by a bottom up deterministic schema. $$$$$ However, since there are no nonterminal symbols involved in dependency parsing, we also need to maintain a representation of the dependency graph being constructed during processing.

If we consider transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008), the purely bottom-up strategy is implemented by the arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ Comparing the two algorithms, we see that the Left-Arc transition of the arc-eager algorithm corresponds directly to the Left-Reduce transition of the standard bottom-up algorithm.
If we consider transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008), the purely bottom-up strategy is implemented by the arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ Thus, we can say that the action performed by the Right-Reduce transition in the standard bottom-up algorithm is performed by a Right-Arc transition in combination with a subsequent Reduce transition in the arc-eager algorithm.

Nivre (2004) investigated the issue of (strict ) incrementality for this type of parsers ;i.e., if at any point of the analysis the processed input forms one connected structure. $$$$$ By contrast, parsers that only partially disambiguate the input — partial parsing — are usually deterministic and construct the final analysis in one pass over the input (Abney, 1991; Daelemans et al., 1999).
Nivre (2004) investigated the issue of (strict ) incrementality for this type of parsers ;i.e., if at any point of the analysis the processed input forms one connected structure. $$$$$ In the strictest sense, we take incrementality to mean that, at any point during the parsing process, there is a single connected structure representing the analysis of the input consumed so far.

Incrementality is not strict here in the sense of (Nivre, 2004), because sometimes more than one word is needed before parts of the frame are constructed and out put $$$$$ In a dependency structure, every word token is dependent on at most one other word token, usually called its head or regent, which means that the structure can be represented as a directed graph, with nodes representing word tokens and arcs representing dependency relations.
Incrementality is not strict here in the sense of (Nivre, 2004), because sometimes more than one word is needed before parts of the frame are constructed and out put $$$$$ It seems fair to conclude that, although strict word-by-word incrementality is not possible in deterministic dependency parsing, the arc-eager algorithm can in practice be seen as a close approximation of incremental parsing.

The semantics of this transition system is described in (Nivre,2004). $$$$$ Comparing the two algorithms, we see that the Left-Arc transition of the arc-eager algorithm corresponds directly to the Left-Reduce transition of the standard bottom-up algorithm.
The semantics of this transition system is described in (Nivre,2004). $$$$$ Thus, we can say that the action performed by the Right-Reduce transition in the standard bottom-up algorithm is performed by a Right-Arc transition in combination with a subsequent Reduce transition in the arc-eager algorithm.

When restricted to these three transitions, the system is equivalent to the so-called stack-based arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ When restricted to sentences that are accepted by the parser, the degree of incrementality increases to 87.9%.
When restricted to these three transitions, the system is equivalent to the so-called stack-based arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ Using the same representation of parser configurations as before, the arc-eager algorithm can be defined by the transitions given in Figure 5, where wi and wj are arbitrary word tokens (Nivre, 2003)

This idea has been applied to constituency parsing, for example in Sagae and Lavie (2006), and we describe below a simple variant for dependency parsing similar to Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and the arc-standard version of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ Deterministic dependency parsing has recently been proposed as a robust and efficient method for syntactic parsing of unrestricted natural language text (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2003).

These features are found to have high overall accuracy in the Nivre parser (Nivre, 2004) and in human sentence processing modeling (Boston et al, 2008) . $$$$$ In experiments reported in Nivre et al. (2004), a parsing accuracy of 85.7% (unlabeled attachment score) was achieved, using data from a small treebank of Swedish (Einarsson, 1976), divided into a training set of 5054 sentences and a test set of 631 sentences.

This is in line with the Arc-Standard parsing strategy of shift-reduce dependency parsers (Nivre, 2004). $$$$$ In order to understand the constraints on incrementality in dependency parsing, we will begin by considering the most straightforward parsing strategy, i.e. left-to-right bottom-up parsing, which in this case is essentially equivalent to shift-reduce parsing with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form.
