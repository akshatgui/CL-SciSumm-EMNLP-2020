As a discourse progresses, an adequate discourse model must represent the relevant entities, and the relationships between them (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), A speaker may then felicitously refer anaphorically to an object (subject to focusing or centering constraints (Grosz et al, 1983, Sidner 1981, 1983, Brennan et al 1987)) if there is an existing DE representing it, or if a corresponding DE may be directly inferred from an existing DE. $$$$$ The theory is a further development and integration of two lines of research

It was reported that the lexical chains closely correlated to the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the texts, where the start and end of chains coincided with the intention ranges. $$$$$ An account of discourse structure is closely related to two questions

The most well-known of work from this period is that of Mann and Thompson (1988), Grosz and Sidner (1986b), Moore and Moser (1996), Polanyi and van den Berg (1996), and Asher and Lascarides (2003). $$$$$ Reichman-Adar 1984, Schank et al. 1982, Mann and Thompson 1983), nor on the particulars of individual intentions.

That is, as Grosz and Sidner (1986b) argued several years ago, the sentences may only be related by their communicative intentions one sentence intended to draw the reader's attention to the specific error that was made (so that the reader knows what was mis-stated), the other intended to correct it. $$$$$ Intentions that are intended to be recognized achieve their intended effect only if the intention is recognized.

This belief that different aspects of discourse would be related, is what led Grosz and Sidner (1986b) to propose a theory that linked what they called the intentional structure of discourse, with its linguistic structure and with the reader or listener's cognitive attentional structure. $$$$$ In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components

As Grosz and Sidner (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) pointed out, cue phrases such as now and well serve to indicate a topic change. $$$$$ We examine several changes and the cue phrases that can indicate each of them.
As Grosz and Sidner (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) pointed out, cue phrases such as now and well serve to indicate a topic change. $$$$$ There are cue phrases that announce one and only one kind of change.

Indeed, the COLLAGEN architecture, like that of the Queen's Communicator, manages discourse using a focus stack, a classical idea in the theory of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ The focusing structure is a stack.
Indeed, the COLLAGEN architecture, like that of the Queen's Communicator, manages discourse using a focus stack, a classical idea in the theory of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ It is rather that one objective of discourse theory (not a topic considered here, however) is to explain how the OCP builds up a model of the task structure by using information supplied in the discourse.

This structure, in turn, identifies domains for interpretation; many systems for anaphora resolution rely on some notion of locality (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ We use the term determination to refer to a semantic-like notion, namely, the complete specification of what is intended by whom; we use the term recognition to refer to a processing notion, namely, the processing that leads a discourse participant to identify what the intention is.
This structure, in turn, identifies domains for interpretation; many systems for anaphora resolution rely on some notion of locality (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ We turn to these matters directly in Subsection 4.1.

Examples of such models and their implementation are the information state-update approach (an implemented system is described in (Larsson, 2002)), or more linguistically oriented approaches like the adjacency-pair models or intentional models such as GROSZ and SIDNER's (see (Grosz and Sidner, 1986)). $$$$$ Pollack (1986) describes several properties such theories and models must possess if they are to be adequate for supporting recognition of intention in single-utterance queries; she shows how current Al planning models are inadequate and proposes an alternative planning formalism.

DAR presupposes the discourse structure described by Grosz and Sidner (1986). $$$$$ The theory is a further development and integration of two lines of research

In order to cover coreference over discourse segments the centering model was extended by a stack mechanism (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ One such mechanism is centering (which we previously called immediate focusing; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Sidner 1979).
In order to cover coreference over discourse segments the centering model was extended by a stack mechanism (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ Flashbacks are also distinct from normally embedded discourses because of the precedence relationship between the DSPs for the two segments and the order in which the segments occur.

Since a more general theory to referring expressions is needed, an extension is presented by Grosz and Sidner (1986). $$$$$ Referring expressions provide the primary example of this effect.3 The segmentation of discourse constrains the use of referring expressions by delineating certain points at which there is a significant change in what entities (objects, properties, or relations) are being discussed.
Since a more general theory to referring expressions is needed, an extension is presented by Grosz and Sidner (1986). $$$$$ The theory of discourse structure presented in this paper is a generalization of theories of task-oriented dialogues.

This message constitutes the primary communicative or dis course goal (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the graphic and captures its main contribution to the overall dis course goal of the entire document. $$$$$ Our goal has been to generalize these constructs properly to a wide range of discourse types.
This message constitutes the primary communicative or dis course goal (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the graphic and captures its main contribution to the overall dis course goal of the entire document. $$$$$ An adequate computational model of the recognition process depends critically on an adequate theory of intention and action; this, of course, is a large research problem in itself and one not restricted to matters of discourse.

Therefore, it is appropriate to close the initial summary with propositions from the computational class so that the whole graphic is in the user's focus of attention (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ Copyright 1986 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.
Therefore, it is appropriate to close the initial summary with propositions from the computational class so that the whole graphic is in the user's focus of attention (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ Whether one constructs a computer system that can participate in a discourse (i.e., one that is a language user) or defines a psychological theory of language use, the task will require the appropriate projection of this abstract model onto properties of a language user, and specification of additional details (e.g., specifying memory for linguistic structure, means for encoding attentional state, and appropriate representations of intentional structure).

structure of discourse segment purposes in the view of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). $$$$$ The kinds of intentions that can serve as discourse purposes or discourse segment purposes are distinguished from other intentions by the fact that they are intended to be recognized (cf.

Recognizing the structure of text is an essential task in text understanding. [GroszandSidner, 1986]. $$$$$ To illustrate the basic theory we have just sketched, we will give a brief analysis of two kinds of discourse

Third, the knowledge of textual structure helps to interpret the meaning of entities in a text (Grosz and Sidner 1986). $$$$$ Moreover, they are also related

Grosz and Sidner (1986) proposed a theory of discourse structure to account for why an utterance was said and what was meant by it. $$$$$ By specifying the basic units a discourse comprises and the ways in which they can relate, a proper account of discourse structure provides the basis for an account of discourse meaning.
