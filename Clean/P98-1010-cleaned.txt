Of the several slightly different definitions of a base NP in the literature we use for the purposes of this work the definition presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and used also by (Argamon et al, 1998) and others. $$$$$ Surprisingly, though, rather little work has been devoted to learning local syntactic patterns, mostly noun phrases (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Vilain and Day, 1996).

SV phrases, following the definition suggested in (Argamon et al, 1998), are word phrases starting with the subject of the sentence and ending with the first verb, excluding modal verbs. $$$$$ We have tested our algorithm in recognizing three syntactic patterns

As reported in (Argamon et al, 1998), most base NPs present in the data are less or equal than 4 words long. $$$$$ Figure 3 shows the learning curves by amount of training examples and number of words in the training data, for particular parameter settings.
As reported in (Argamon et al, 1998), most base NPs present in the data are less or equal than 4 words long. $$$$$ We refer here only to the DOP (Data Oriented Parsing) method (Bod, 1992) which, like the present work, is a memory-based approach.

Argamon et al (1998) segmented the POS sequence of a multi-word into small POS tiles, counted tile frequency in the new word and non-new-word on the training set respectively, and detected new words using these counts. $$$$$ Performance may be measured also on a word-by word basis, counting as a success any word which was identified correctly as being part of the target pattern.

(1996), for POS tagging; Cardie (1993), for syntactic and semantic tagging; and Stanfill and Waltz (1986), for word pronunciation.

(Argamon et al, 1998) use Memory-Based Sequence Learning for recognizing both NP chunks and VP chunks. $$$$$ A Memory-Based Approach to Learning Shallow Natural Language Patterns
(Argamon et al, 1998) use Memory-Based Sequence Learning for recognizing both NP chunks and VP chunks. $$$$$ Ahonen et al. (1994) describe an algorithm for learning (k,h)-contextual regular languages, which they use for learning the structure of SGML documents.

Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), Munoz et al (1999), Argamon et al (1998), Daelemans et al (1999a) find NP chunks, using Wall Street Journal training material of about 9000 sentences. $$$$$ We used the NP data prepared by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), hereafter RM95.
