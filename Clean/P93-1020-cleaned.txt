To attempt to overcome this issue, both Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1993) conflated multiple manual segmentations into one that contained only those boundaries which the majority of coders agreed upon. $$$$$ Hearst (1993) derived a discourse structure for each text in her study, by incorporating the boundaries agreed upon by the majority of her subjects.

Additionally, the definition of what constitutes a majority is subjective (e.g., Passonneau and Litman (1993, p. 150), Litman and Passonneau (1995), Hearst (1993, p. 6) each used 4/7, 3/7, and $$$$$ Intention was explained in common sense terms and by example (details in (Litman and Passonneau, 1993)).

Similar to (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we adopt a flat model of topic segmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents. $$$$$ Hearst (1993) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of three expository texts (length 77 to 160 sentences), to indicate topic changes.
Similar to (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we adopt a flat model of topic segmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents. $$$$$ We develop three segmentation algorithms, based on results in the discourse literature.

However, implementing the NM in a new domain re quires little expertise as previous work has shown that native users can reliably annotate the information needed for the NM (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Intention was explained in common sense terms and by example (details in (Litman and Passonneau, 1993)).

With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of "topic" that builds upon Passonneau and Litman's seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Intention was explained in common sense terms and by example (details in (Litman and Passonneau, 1993)).

Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ Intention was explained in common sense terms and by example (details in (Litman and Passonneau, 1993)).
Passonneau and Litman (1993) were the first to investigate the relationship between cue phrases and linear segmentation. $$$$$ We develop a 19seline segmentation algorithm based on cue words, using a simplification of one of the features shown by Hirschberg and Litman (1993) to identify discourse usages of cue words.
