(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) have presented three variants of this tagging representation. $$$$$ We have used the baseNP data presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)2.

 $$$$$ In the version of the algorithm that we have used, is 1-IG, the distances between feature representations are computed as the weighted sum of distances between individual features (Daelemans et al., 1998).
 $$$$$ Some more room for improved performance lies in computing the POS tags in the data with a better tagger than presently used.

(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) compare different data representations for this task. $$$$$ Therefore we will compare seven different data representation formats for the baseNP recognition task.
(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) compare different data representations for this task. $$$$$ The three combinations of partial representations systematically outperformed the four complete representations.

We encoded the opinionated expression brackets using the IOB2 encoding scheme (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ We have chosen to divide bracketing experiments in two parts

There are four kinds of chunk tags in the CoNLL-1999 dataset, namely IOB1, IOB2, IOE1, and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ The rules use context information of the words, the part-of-speech tags that have been assigned to them and the chunk tags that are associated with them.
There are four kinds of chunk tags in the CoNLL-1999 dataset, namely IOB1, IOB2, IOE1, and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ Therefore we have only used the best stage 1 approach with IOB1 tags

The mention encoding is the IOB2 encoding presented in (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) and introduced by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994) for base noun phrase chunking. $$$$$ (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) have introduced a &quot;convenient&quot; data representation for chunking by converting it to a tagging task.

We used the JNLPBA-2004 training data, which is a set of tokenized word sequences with IOB2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) protein labels. $$$$$ During training it stores a symbolic feature representation of a word in the training data together with its classification (chunk tag).
We used the JNLPBA-2004 training data, which is a set of tokenized word sequences with IOB2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) protein labels. $$$$$ They are better than the results for section 15 because more training data was used in these experiments.

From now on, we shall refer to the Chunk tag of a word as its IOB value (IOB was named by Tjong Kim Sang and Jorn Veeenstra (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) after Ratnaparkhi (Ratnaparkhi, 1998)). $$$$$ An example is the representation used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) where all the chunkinitial words receive the same start tag (analogous to the B tag) while the remainder of the words in the chunk are paired with a different tag.

Tjong Kim Sang calls this method as IOB1 representation, and introduces three alternative versions - IOB2, IOE1 and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ IOE1 The final word inside a baseNP immediately preceding another baseNP receives an E tag.

To transform the problem into a classification task, we use the IOB2 classification scheme (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ After this, we will use the classification results of the best context size for determining the optimal context size for the classification tags.
