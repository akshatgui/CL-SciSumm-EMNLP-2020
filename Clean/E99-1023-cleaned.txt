(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) have presented three variants of this tagging representation. $$$$$ We have used the baseNP data presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)2.

 $$$$$ In the version of the algorithm that we have used, is 1-IG, the distances between feature representations are computed as the weighted sum of distances between individual features (Daelemans et al., 1998).
 $$$$$ Some more room for improved performance lies in computing the POS tags in the data with a better tagger than presently used.

(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) compare different data representations for this task. $$$$$ Therefore we will compare seven different data representation formats for the baseNP recognition task.
(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) compare different data representations for this task. $$$$$ The three combinations of partial representations systematically outperformed the four complete representations.

We encoded the opinionated expression brackets using the IOB2 encoding scheme (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ We have chosen to divide bracketing experiments in two parts: one for recognizing opening brackets and one for recognizing closing brackets.
We encoded the opinionated expression brackets using the IOB2 encoding scheme (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ To avoid this we have refrained from using this tag.

There are four kinds of chunk tags in the CoNLL-1999 dataset, namely IOB1, IOB2, IOE1, and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ The rules use context information of the words, the part-of-speech tags that have been assigned to them and the chunk tags that are associated with them.
There are four kinds of chunk tags in the CoNLL-1999 dataset, namely IOB1, IOB2, IOE1, and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ Therefore we have only used the best stage 1 approach with IOB1 tags: a left and right context of three words and three POS tags combined with k=3.

The mention encoding is the IOB2 encoding presented in (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) and introduced by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994) for base noun phrase chunking. $$$$$ (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) have introduced a &quot;convenient&quot; data representation for chunking by converting it to a tagging task.

We used the JNLPBA-2004 training data, which is a set of tokenized word sequences with IOB2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) protein labels. $$$$$ During training it stores a symbolic feature representation of a word in the training data together with its classification (chunk tag).
We used the JNLPBA-2004 training data, which is a set of tokenized word sequences with IOB2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) protein labels. $$$$$ They are better than the results for section 15 because more training data was used in these experiments.

From now on, we shall refer to the Chunk tag of a word as its IOB value (IOB was named by Tjong Kim Sang and Jorn Veeenstra (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) after Ratnaparkhi (Ratnaparkhi, 1998)). $$$$$ An example is the representation used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) where all the chunkinitial words receive the same start tag (analogous to the B tag) while the remainder of the words in the chunk are paired with a different tag.

Tjong Kim Sang calls this method as IOB1 representation, and introduces three alternative versions - IOB2, IOE1 and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ IOE1 The final word inside a baseNP immediately preceding another baseNP receives an E tag.

To transform the problem into a classification task, we use the IOB2 classification scheme (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999). $$$$$ After this, we will use the classification results of the best context size for determining the optimal context size for the classification tags.
