These models are roughly clustered into two groups $$$$$ The standard approach to word alignment from sentence-aligned bitexts has been to constructmodels which generate sentences of one language from the other, then fitting those genera tive models with EM (Brown et al, 1990; Och and Ney, 2003).
These models are roughly clustered into two groups $$$$$ One source of constraint which our model stilldoes not explicitly capture is the first-order de pendency between alignment positions, as in theHMM model (Vogel et al, 1996) and IBM models 4+.

Similarly, Taskar et al (2005) cast word alignment as a maximum weighted matching problem and propose a framework for learning word pair scores as a function of arbitrary features of that pair. $$$$$ Word alignment is cast as a maximum weighted matching problem (Cormen et al, 1990) in which each pair of words (e j , f k ) in a sentence pair (e, f) is associated with a score s jk (e, f) reflecting the desirability of the alignment of that pair.
