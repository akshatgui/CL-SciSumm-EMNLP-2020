These models are roughly clustered into two groups: generative models, such as those proposed by Brown et al (1993), Vogel et al (1996), and Och and Ney (2003), and discriminative mod els, such as those proposed by Taskar et al (2005), Moore (2005), and Blunsom and Cohn (2006). $$$$$ The standard approach to word alignment from sentence-aligned bitexts has been to constructmodels which generate sentences of one language from the other, then fitting those genera tive models with EM (Brown et al, 1990; Och and Ney, 2003).

Similarly, Taskar et al (2005) cast word alignment as a maximum weighted matching problem and propose a framework for learning word pair scores as a function of arbitrary features of that pair. $$$$$ Word alignment is cast as a maximum weighted matching problem (Cormen et al, 1990) in which each pair of words (e j , f k ) in a sentence pair (e, f) is associated with a score s jk (e, f) reflecting the desirability of the alignment of that pair.

Methods like competitive linking (Melamed, 2000) and maximum matching (Taskar et al, 2005) use a one-to-one constraint, where words in either sentence can participate in at most one link. $$$$$ This view of alignment as graph matching isnot, in itself, new: Melamed (2000) uses com petitive linking to greedily construct matchingswhere the pair score is a measure of word to-word association, and Matusov et al (2004) find exact maximum matchings where the pair scores come from the alignment posteriors of generative models.

Dice Coefficient of the source word and the target word (Taskar et al, 2005). $$$$$ As observed in Melamed (2000), this use ofDice misses the crucial constraint of competition: a candidate source word with high asso ciation to a target word may be unavailable for alignment because some other target has an even better affinity for that source word.
