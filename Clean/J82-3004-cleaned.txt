In addition to the cases of left-linear and right linear grammars discussed in Section 3, our algorithm is exact in a variety of interesting cases, including the examples of Church and Patil (1982), which illustrate how typical attachment ambiguities arise as structural ambiguities on regular string sets. $$$$$ Similar analyses have been discussed for a number of lexically and structurally ambiguous constructions, culminating with the example in section 9, where we transformed a grammar into a form that could be parsed by a single left-to-right pass over the terminal elements.

In contrast, our method will produce an exact FSA for many interesting grammars generating regular languages, such as those arising from systematic attachment ambiguities (Church and Patil, 1982). $$$$$ Both the subject and the predicate produce a Catalan number of parses, and hence the result is the product of two Catalan numbers, which was verified by EQSP (Martin, Church, and Patil 1981, p. 53).

As the NP length increases, the number of possible binary trees (parses) increases with the Catalan numbers (Church and Patil, 1982). $$$$$ The ith Catalan number is the number of binary trees that can be constructed over i phrases.

Coordination ambiguity is under-explored, despite being one of the three major sources of structural ambiguity (together with prepositional phrase attachment and noun compound bracketing), and belonging to the class of ambiguities for which the number of analyses is the number of binary trees over the corresponding nodes (Church and Patil, 1982), and despite the fact that conjunctions are among the most frequent words. $$$$$ This formula says that sentences are all of the form

The number of possible binary-branching parses of a sentence is defined by the Catalan number, an exponential combinatoric function (Church and Patil, 1982), so dynamic programming is crucial for efficiency. $$$$$ This formula says that sentences are all of the form
