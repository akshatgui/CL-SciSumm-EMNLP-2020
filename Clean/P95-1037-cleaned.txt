Not to mention earlier non-PCFG lexicalized statistical parsers, notably Magerman (1995) for the Penn Treebank, also modified the treebank to contain different labels for standard and for base noun phrases. $$$$$ The Lancaster treebank uses 195 part-ofspeech tags and 19 non-terminal labels.
Not to mention earlier non-PCFG lexicalized statistical parsers, notably Magerman (1995) for the Penn Treebank, also modified the treebank to contain different labels for standard and for base noun phrases. $$$$$ The Penn Treebank uses 46 part-of-speech tags and 27 non-terminal labels.2 The WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank is divided into 25 sections, numbered 00 - 24.

Furthermore, subtrees with terminal symbols can be viewed as learning dependencies among the words in the subtree, obviating the need for the manual specification (Magerman, 1995) or automatic inference (Chiang and Bikel, 2002) of lexical dependencies. $$$$$ Parsing a natural language sentence can be viewed as making a sequence of disambiguation decisions: determining the part-of-speech of the words, choosing between possible constituent structures, and selecting labels for the constituents.

The probability models of Charniak (1997), Magerman (1995) and Ratnaparkhi (1997) dier in their details but are based on similar features. $$$$$ The grammarian is accomplishing two critical tasks: identifying the features which are relevant to each decision, and deciding which choice to select based on the values of the relevant features.

In both cases, we report PARSEVAL labeled bracket scores (Magerman, 1995), with the brackets labeled by syntactic categories but not grammatical functions. $$$$$ A parse tree can be viewed as an n-ary branching tree, with each node in a tree labeled by either a non-terminal label or a part-of-speech label.
In both cases, we report PARSEVAL labeled bracket scores (Magerman, 1995), with the brackets labeled by syntactic categories but not grammatical functions. $$$$$ Since SPATTER uses the same syntactic label set as the Penn Treebank, it makes sense to report labelled precision and labelled recall.

We apply canonical lexical head projection rules (Magerman, 1995) in order to lexicalize syntactic trees. $$$$$ An important point which has been omitted from this discussion of decision trees is the fact that only binary questions are used in these decision trees.

These features are also computed for the head of the phrase, determined using a set of head finding rules in the style of Magerman (1995) adapted to TiGer. $$$$$ This probability P(flh) is determined by asking a sequence of questions qi q2...q„ about the context, where the ith question asked is uniquely determined by the answers to the i —1 previous questions.

For each possible constituent in a parse tree, rules first described in (Magerman, 1995) and (Jelinek et al, 1994) identify the head-child and propagate the head-word to its parent. $$$$$ These 30 questions are determined by growing a classification tree on the word vocabulary as described in (Brown et al., 1992).
For each possible constituent in a parse tree, rules first described in (Magerman, 1995) and (Jelinek et al, 1994) identify the head-child and propagate the head-word to its parent. $$$$$ The extension can take on any of the following five values: right - the node is the first child of a constituent; left - the node is the last child of a constituent; up - the node is neither the first nor the last child of a constituent; unary - the node is a child of a unary constituent; root - the node is the root of the tree.

The conventional wisdom since Magerman (1995) has been that lexicalization substantially improves performance compared to an unlexicalized baseline model (e.g., a probabilistic context-free grammar, PCFG). $$$$$ In a problem like parsing, where long-distance lexical information is crucial to disambiguate interpretations accurately, local models like probabilistic context-free grammars are inadequate.
