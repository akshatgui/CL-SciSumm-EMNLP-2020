First, well-nestedness is interesting as a generalization of projectivity (Marcus, 1967) while more than 23% of the 73088 dependency structures in the Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech (Hajic et al., 2001) are non-projective, only 0.11% are not well-nested (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006). $$$$$ We compare the proposals from a theoretical point of view, and evaluate a subset of them empirically by testing their representational adequacy with respect to two dependency treebanks

Mildly non-projective trees are of both theoretical and practical interest, as they correspond to derivations in Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Bodirsky et al, 2005) and cover the overwhelming majority of sentences found in tree banks for Czech and Danish (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006). $$$$$ Bodirsky et al. (2005) present two structural constraints on dependency graphs that characterize analyses corresponding to derivations in Tree Adjoining Grammar

In this paper, we consider all constraints and measures evaluated by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) with some minor variations. $$$$$ As an example, consider the node labelled i in the dependency graphs in Figure 3.

None of the constraints and measures in Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) take into account levels of nodes explicitly. $$$$$ These subtrees interleave, as T1 contains the nodes 2 and 4, and T2 contains the nodes 3 and 5.
None of the constraints and measures in Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) take into account levels of nodes explicitly. $$$$$ The fundamental difference between gap degree and edge degree is that the gap degree measures the number of discontinuities within a subtree, while the edge degree measures the number of intervening constituents spanned by a single edge.

They confirm the findings of Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) $$$$$ In dependency-based parsing, several constraints have been proposed that restrict the class of permissible structures, such as projectivity, planarity, multi-planarity, well-nestedness, gap degree, and edge degree.
They confirm the findings of Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) $$$$$ In this section, we present an experimental evaluation of planarity, well-nestedness, gap degree, and edge degree, by examining how large a proportion of the structures found in two dependency treebanks are allowed under different constraints.

This supports our theoretical results and confirms that properties of non-projective edges provide a more accurate as well as expressive means for describing non projective structures in natural language than the constraints and measures considered by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006). $$$$$ Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Structures
This supports our theoretical results and confirms that properties of non-projective edges provide a more accurate as well as expressive means for describing non projective structures in natural language than the constraints and measures considered by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006). $$$$$ However, recent results in non-projective dependency parsing, especially using data-driven methods, indicate that most non-projective structures required for the analysis of natural language are very nearly projective, differing only minimally from the best projective approximation (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Novák, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).

Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) compare several constraints on dependency structures and among the considered ones find well-nestedness to be in good accord with empirical data. $$$$$ In section 3, we define and compare five different constraints on mildly non-projective dependency structures that can be found in the literature

Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) claim that the constraint of well-nestedness seems to approximate well dependency structures occurring in natural language. $$$$$ However, recent results in non-projective dependency parsing, especially using data-driven methods, indicate that most non-projective structures required for the analysis of natural language are very nearly projective, differing only minimally from the best projective approximation (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Novák, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) claim that the constraint of well-nestedness seems to approximate well dependency structures occurring in natural language. $$$$$ Assuming that the treebank structures are sampled from naturally occurring structures in natural language, this provides an indirect evaluation of the linguistic adequacy of the different proposals.

Unlike acyclicity and the single head constraints, which impose restrictions on the dependency relation as such, projectivity constrains the interaction between the dependency relations and the order of the nodes in the sentence (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006). $$$$$ Many practical implementations of dependency parsing are restricted to projective structures, where the projection of a head word has to form a continuous substring of the sentence.

If we suppose that the characterization of dependency structures as reported by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) for Czech and Danish extends cross-linguistically, i.e. the dependency structures for natural language falls within the class of well-nested and gap degree <= 1 dependency structures, then MC-TAG appears to correspond to the wrong class of model-theoretic dependency structures. $$$$$ Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Structures

While the number of highly non-projective dependency structures is negligible for practical applications (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006), the rank can not easily be bounded. $$$$$ Mildly Non-Projective Dependency Structures
While the number of highly non-projective dependency structures is negligible for practical applications (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006), the rank can not easily be bounded. $$$$$ In this paper, we review a number of proposals for classes of dependency structures that lie between strictly projective and completely unrestricted non-projective structures.

It is interesting to compare our approach with techniques for well-nested dependency trees (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006). $$$$$ When we compare the two graded constraints to each other, we find that the gap degree measure partitions the data into less and larger clusters than the edge degree, which may be an advantage in the context of using the degree constraints as features in a data-driven approach towards parsing.
