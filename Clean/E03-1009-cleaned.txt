We used Alexander Clarke's software, based on (Clark, 2003), to cluster the words, and then allow each word to be labeled with any part of speech tag seen in the data with any other word in the same cluster. $$$$$ Word baseline each word is in its own class.
We used Alexander Clarke's software, based on (Clark, 2003), to cluster the words, and then allow each word to be labeled with any part of speech tag seen in the data with any other word in the same cluster. $$$$$ This algorithm iteratively improves the likelihood of a given clustering by moving each word from its current cluster to the cluster that will give the maximum increase in likelihood, or leaving it in its original cluster if no improvement can be found.

Since induction is founded to some extent upon disambiguating contexts, this work has some bearing on the evaluation of induced categories with corpus annotation; not only is there more than one tag set in existence (see discussion in Clark, 2003), but annotation schemes make distinctions that morphosyntactic contexts can not readily capture. $$$$$ First, early work used an informal evaluation of manually comparing the clusters or dendrograms produced by the algorithms with the authors' intuitive judgment of the lexical categories.

As a base tagger, we modify a leading unsupervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) to constrain the distributions of word types across clusters to be Zipfian, allowing us to utilize a perplexity-based quality test. $$$$$ This just has the effect of discriminating between classes that will have lots of types (i.e. open class clusters) and clusters that tend to have few types (corresponding to closed class words).
As a base tagger, we modify a leading unsupervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) to constrain the distributions of word types across clusters to be Zipfian, allowing us to utilize a perplexity-based quality test. $$$$$ We selected the 10 clusters with the largest number of zero frequency word types in.

Figure 1 demonstrates this phenomenon for a leading POS induction algorithm (Clark, 2003). $$$$$ Combining Distributional And Morphological Information For Part Of Speech Induction
Figure 1 demonstrates this phenomenon for a leading POS induction algorithm (Clark, 2003). $$$$$ Figure 5 shows how the conditional entropy varies with respect to the frequency for these models.

We focus here on Clark's tagger (Clark, 2003) (CT), probably the leading POS induction algorithm (see Table 3). $$$$$ Combining Distributional And Morphological Information For Part Of Speech Induction

Clark (2003) proposed a perplexity based test for the quality of his POS induction algorithm. $$$$$ We have also evaluated this method by comparing the perplexity of a class-based language model derived from these classes.
Clark (2003) proposed a perplexity based test for the quality of his POS induction algorithm. $$$$$ As can be seen the models incorporating morphological information have slightly lower perplexity on the test data than the D5 model.

In this paper we show that for the tagger of (Clark, 2003) such a method provides mediocre results (Table 2) even when the training criterion (likelihood or data probability for this tagger) is evaluated on the test set. $$$$$ We used the full vocabulary of the training and test sets together which was 45679, of which 14576 had frequency zero in the training data and thus had to be categorised based solely on their morphology and frequency.

For example, (Sch?utze, 1993) induces 200 clusters and (Clark, 2003) chooses between 16-128; and most of these induced categories are difficult to associate with a specific POS tag. $$$$$ A second form of evaluation is to use some data that has been manually or semi-automatically annotated with part of speech (POS) tags, and to use some information theoretic measure to look at the correlation between the 'correct' data and the induced POS tags.

We continue by tagging the corpus using Clark's unsupervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) and the unsupervised Prototype Tagger (Abendetal., 2010). $$$$$ In this paper we discuss algorithms for clustering words into classes from unlabelled text using unsupervised algorithms, based on distributional and morphological information.

In the 'Fully Unsupervised' scenario, prepositions and verbs were identified using Clark's tagger (Clark, 2003). $$$$$ The task studied in this paper is the unsupervised learning of parts-of-speech, that is to say lexical categories corresponding to traditional notions of, for example, nouns and verbs.

Toutanova et al.
