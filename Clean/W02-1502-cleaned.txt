The SRG is implemented within the Linguistic Knowledge Building (LKB) system (Copestake, 2002), based on the basic components of the grammar Matrix, an open source starter-kit for the development of HPSG grammars developed as part of the LinGO consortium's multilingual grammar engineering (Bender et al, 2002). $$$$$ The Grammar Matrix

What I am reporting is thus a perspective on work done primarily by Flickinger within the English Resource Grammar (ERG $$$$$ In HPSG, the most extensive grammars are those of English (Flickinger, 2000), German (M¨uller & Kasper, 2000), and Japanese (Siegel, 2000; Siegel & Bender, 2002).
What I am reporting is thus a perspective on work done primarily by Flickinger within the English Resource Grammar (ERG $$$$$ The matrix is built to give Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake et al., 2001; Copestake, Flickinger, Sag, & Pollard, 1999; Copestake, Flickinger, Malouf, Riehemann, & Sag, 1995) representations.

In this paper I shall present a treatment of lexical and grammatical tone and vowel length in Hausa, as implemented in an emerging bidirectional HPSG of the language based on the Lingo Grammar Matrix (Bender et al, 2002). $$$$$ Extensions to the matrix will be based on careful study of existing implemented grammars for other languages, notably German, Spanish and Japanese, as well as feedback from those using the first version of the matrix.

To better understand the needs of grammar developers we carefully explored two existing grammars $$$$$ The Grammar Matrix

The LinGO Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al., 2002) is situated within the DELPH-IN2 collaboration and is both a repository of reusable linguistic knowledge and a method of delivering this knowledge to a user in the form of an extensible precision implemented grammar. $$$$$ As part of the LinGO consortium’s multi-lingual grammar engineering effort, we are developing a ‘grammar matrix’ or starter-kit, distilling the wisdom of existing grammars and codifying and documenting it in a form that can be used as the basis for new grammars.

We share grammar libraries with the Grammar Matrix in the grammar (Bender et al, 2002) as the foundation of KRG2. $$$$$ The matrix itself is not a grammar but a collection of generalizations across grammars.
We share grammar libraries with the Grammar Matrix in the grammar (Bender et al, 2002) as the foundation of KRG2. $$$$$ The matrix enables the developer of a grammar for a new language to get a quick start on producing a system that parses and generates with non-trivial semantics, while also building the foundation for a widecoverage grammar of the language.

To this end, the Grammar Matrix project (Bender et al, 2002) has been developed which, through a set of questionnaires, allows grammar engineers to quickly produce a core grammar for a language of their choice. $$$$$ We have produced a preliminary version of the grammar matrix relying heavily on the LinGO project’s English Resource Grammar, and to a lesser extent on the Japanese grammar developed jointly between DFKI Saarbr¨ucken (Germany) and YY Technologies (Mountain View, CA).

In this research, we focus particularly on the Grammar Matrix-based DELPH-IN family of grammars (Bender et al, 2002), which includes grammars of English, Japanese, Norwegian, Modern Greek, Portuguese and Korean. $$$$$ In HPSG, the most extensive grammars are those of English (Flickinger, 2000), German (M¨uller & Kasper, 2000), and Japanese (Siegel, 2000; Siegel & Bender, 2002).
