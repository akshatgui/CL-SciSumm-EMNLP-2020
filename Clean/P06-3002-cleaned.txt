 $$$$$ It is time-linear with respect to the number of edges, making its application viable even for graphs with several million nodes and edges.
 $$$$$ Ideally, the application should tell us the granularity of our tagger: e.g. semantic class learners could greatly benefit from the high-granular word sets arising in both of our partitionings, which we endeavoured to lump into a coarser tagset here.

In Biemann (2006b), the tagger output was directly compared to supervised taggers for English, German and Finnish via information-theoretic measures. $$$$$ The resulting taggers are evaluated against outputs of supervised taggers for various languages.

We train SVM Tool and an unsupervised tagger, Unsupos (Biemann, 2006), on our training sections and apply them to the development, test and unlabeled sections. $$$$$ Finally, we train a Viterbi tagger with this lexicon and augment it with an affix classifier for unknown words.
We train SVM Tool and an unsupervised tagger, Unsupos (Biemann, 2006), on our training sections and apply them to the development, test and unlabeled sections. $$$$$ Unlike in supervised scenarios, our task is not to train a tagger model from a small corpus of hand-tagged data, but from our clusters of derived syntactic categories and a considerably large, yet unlabeled corpus.

Nevertheless, many of the practically useful spell checkers incorporate context information and the current analysis on SpellNet can be extended for such spell-checkers by conceptualizing a network of words that capture the word co-occurrence patterns (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ The word’s global context is the sum of all its contexts.

In order to test the argument above, and as an attempt to improve the results from the previous experiment, POS-tags were induced using Biemann's unsupervised POS-tagger (Biemann, 2006). $$$$$ Using the resulting word clusters as a lexicon, a Viterbi POS tagger is trained, which is refined by a morphological component.

Additionally, we used an unsupervised part-of-speech tagger (see (Biemann, 2006)) to tag the NEGRA corpus to be able to present a complete unsupervised parsing process relying on word strings only. $$$$$ Unsupervised Part-Of-Speech Tagging Employing Efficient Graph Clustering

Mintz (2003) only uses the most frequent 45 frames and Biemann (2006) clusters the most frequent 10,000 words using contexts formed from the most frequent 150-200 words. $$$$$ Contexts in that sense are often restricted to the most frequent words.

Perhaps due to the overly simplistic methods employed to compute morphological information, morphology has only been used as what Biemann (2006) called add-on's in existing POS induction algorithms, which remain primarily distributional in nature. $$$$$ The words used to describe syntactic contexts will be called feature words in the remainder.
