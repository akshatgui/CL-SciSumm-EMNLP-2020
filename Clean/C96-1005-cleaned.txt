In the second column, recall and precision are relative to polysemous verbs only, and in spite of an obvious decrease compare well with related work carried out with different methods (see, for instance, [Agirre and Rigau, 1996]), and are in fact very promising if one considers the comparatively small size of EB, and that only part of its attested words are semantically disambiguated. $$$$$ Agirre, E. and Rigau G. 1996.

To overcome the problem of varying link distances, Agirre and Rigau (1996) propose a semantic similarity measure (referred to as& quot; conceptual density& quot;) which is sensitive to i) the length of the path, ii) the depth of the nodes in the hierarchy (deeper nodes are ranked closer) and iii) the density of nodes in the sub hierarchies (concepts involved in a denser sub hierarchy are ranked closer than those in a more sparse region). $$$$$ the depth in the hierarchy: concepts in a deeper part of the hierarchy should be ranked closer.
