To overcome the problem of varying link distances, Agirre and Rigau (1996) propose a semantic similarity measure (referred to as& quot; conceptual density& quot;) which is sensitive to i) the length of the path, ii) the depth of the nodes in the hierarchy (deeper nodes are ranked closer) and iii) the density of nodes in the sub hierarchies (concepts involved in a denser sub hierarchy are ranked closer than those in a more sparse region). $$$$$ the depth in the hierarchy
