 $$$$$ The word &quot;know&quot; is used in at least three different senses in English.

In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ But 2.3e is infelicitous as a (literal) question since there is no context where one can acquire information by querying one's own mental state.
In addition to conveying information about one's own mental state, pragmatic principles and rules, such as those we have presented, may be deployed to reason about the intentions and beliefs of others (Perrault and Allen, 1980). $$$$$ More detail, motivation, and problems, are available in Allen [1979] and Allen and Perrault [1980].

Indirect speech acts are studied by Clark (1979), Perrault and Allen (1980), Allen and Perrault (1980) and Asher and Lascarides (2003), who identify a wide range of factors that govern how speakers convey their intended messages and how hearers seek to uncover those messages from uncertain and conflicting signals. $$$$$ More detail, motivation, and problems, are available in Allen [1979] and Allen and Perrault [1980].

This is computationally much less complex than classical speech act planning (Perrault and Allen, 1980), in which the intended physical effect comes at the end of a long chain of inferences. $$$$$ In Perrault, Allen, and Cohen [1978] we suggested that it is useful to consider speech acts in the context of a planning system.
