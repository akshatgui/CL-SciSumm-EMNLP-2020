Labeling of sentence boundaries is a necessary prerequisite for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988), (Cutting et al, 1991), and sentence alignment (Gale and Church, 1993), (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ We have found that a sentence in one language normally matches exactly one sentence in the other language (1-1).

For each aligned pair of text chunks, perform the sentence alignment method of Gale and Church (1993). $$$$$ The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences.

Gale and Church (1993) based their align program on the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences. $$$$$ The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.

Previous investigations can be found in works such as (Gale and Church, 1993). $$$$$ It is remarkable that such a simple approach works as well as it does.

Sentences have been aligned using the length-based dynamic programming approach of Gale and Church (1993) enhanced with a small number of lexical and non-alphabetic anchors. $$$$$ On a corpus this small the paragraphs could have been aligned by hand.

The algorithm used to align English-Inuktitut sentences is an extension of that presented in Gale and Church (1993). $$$$$ The first two English sentences in Table 2 illustrate a particularly hard case where two English sentences align to two French sentences.

Following a suggestion in Gale and Church (1993), the alignment was aided by the use of additional anchors that were available for the language pair. $$$$$ (The third pair is probably dependent on the first two.)

All alignments that occurred in the first two sentences of each paragraph were marked as hard boundaries for the Gale and Church (1993) program as provided in their paper. $$$$$ First, paragraph boundaries are identified and then sentences are aligned within paragraphs.

For comparison, the Gale and Church (1993) program, which did not make use of additional anchors, had poorer results over our corpus. $$$$$ Second, it allows comparison of results for different algorithms on a common basis.

We ran a sentence alignment algorithm (Gale and Church, 1993) for each pair of English and Chinese stories. $$$$$ The final alignment matches two English sentences to a single French sentence.
We ran a sentence alignment algorithm (Gale and Church, 1993) for each pair of English and Chinese stories. $$$$$ This value would clearly be inappropriate for English—Chinese alignment, but it seems likely to be useful for most pairs of European languages. s2 is estimated from Figure 3.

Among approaches that are unsupervised and language independent, (Brown et al, 1991) and (Gale and Church, 1993) use sentence-length statistics in order to model the relationship between groups of sentences that are translations of each other. $$$$$ Brown et al. (1990) mention that sentence lengths formed the basis of their method.

A hybrid approach is presented in (Gale and Church, 1993) whose basic hypothesis is that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences. $$$$$ The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.

Gale and Church (1993) proposed a dynamic programming algorithm for the sentence-level alignment of translations that exploited two facts: the length of translated sentences roughly corresponds to the length of the original sentences and the sequence of sentences in translated text largely corresponds to the original order of sentences. $$$$$ The program uses the fact that longer sentences in one language tend to be translated into longer sentences in the other language, and that shorter sentences tend to be translated into shorter sentences.

A second pass aligns the sentences in a way similar to the algorithm described by Gale and Church (1993), but where the search space is constrained to be close to the one delimited by the word alignment. $$$$$ We might advocate our simple character alignment procedure as a first pass, even to those who advocate the use of lexical constraints.

In our case, the score we seek to globally maximize by dynamic programming is not only taking into account the length criteria described in (Gale and Church, 1993) but also a cognate-based one similar to (Simard et al, 1992). $$$$$ This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.

This is in line with previous findings that length difference can help predict alignment (cf. ,e.g., Gale and Church, 1993). $$$$$ Most of the previous work on sentence alignment has yet to be published.
