For the computation of related terms and synonyms, Ruge (1995), Landauer and Dumais (1997), and Fung and McKeown (1997) used the cosine measure, whereas Grefenstette (1994, p. 48) used a weighted Jaccard measure. $$$$$ Consequently, if w, has a high y value everywhere, then the Cosine Measure between any tot and this w, would be high.

(Fung and McKeown 1997, Kikui 1999, Zhao and Vogel 2002) extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from such corpora. $$$$$ Bilingual lexicon translation algorithms for parallel corpora in general make use of fixed correlations between a pair of bilingual terms, reflected in their frequent co-occurrences in translated texts, to find lexicon translations.
(Fung and McKeown 1997, Kikui 1999, Zhao and Vogel 2002) extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from such corpora. $$$$$ Word correlations are important statistical information which has been successfully employed to find bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora.

In Fung and McKeown (1997), a translation model applied to a pair of unrelated languages (English/Japanese) with a random selection of test words, many of them multi-word terms, gives a precision around 30% when only the top candidate is proposed. $$$$$ Translation accuracies are around 30% when only the top candidate is counted.
