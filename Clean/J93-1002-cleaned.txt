Briscoe and Carroll (1993) observed that half of the parse failures were caused by inaccurate sub categorization information in the lexicon. $$$$$ In general, resolution of the first indeterminacy in the input will rule out approximately half the potential analyses, resolution of the next, half of the remaining ones, and so on.
Briscoe and Carroll (1993) observed that half of the parse failures were caused by inaccurate sub categorization information in the lexicon. $$$$$ The parser performs sub-analysis sharing (where if two or more trees have a common sub-analysis, that sub-analysis is represented only once), and local ambiguity packing (in which sub-analyses that have the same top node and cover the same input have their top nodes merged, being treated by higher level structures as a single sub-analysis).

If, instead, this procedure returns a list of several possible actions with corresponding probabilities, we can then parse with a model similar to the probabilistic LR models described by Briscoe and Carroll (1993), where the probability of a parse tree is the product of the probabilities of each of the actions taken in its derivation. $$$$$ Grammar 1 The probability of a particular parse is the product of the probabilities of each rule used in the derivation.

 $$$$$ However, this approach is computationally prohibitively expensive

work by Briscoe and Carroll (1993) on statistical parsing uses an adapted version of the system which is able to process tagged input, ignoring the words in order to parse sequences of tags. $$$$$ In subsequent work (Carroll and Briscoe 1992) we have developed such a heuristic technique for best-first search of the parse forest which, in practice, makes the recovery of the most probable analyses much more efficient (allowing analysis of sentences containing over 30 words).

Finally, we observe that there are also trainable stochastic shift-reduce parser models (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993), which are theoretically related to shift-reduce parsing, but operate in a highly non deterministic fashion during parsing. $$$$$ The majority of states contain just reduce or just shift actions, and in any one state very few different rules are involved in reduce actions.

Following (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993), conflict resolution is based on contextual information extracted from the so called Instantaneous Description or Configuration. $$$$$ In the following sections, we introduce the LR parser and in Section 8 Ted Briscoe and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing we demonstrate that LR parse tables do provide an appropriate amount of contextual information to solve the problems described above.

The probability function can be obtained on the basis of a treebank, as proposed by (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993). $$$$$ Sampson, Haigh, and Atwell report some preliminary results for a parser of this type that uses the technique of simulated annealing to assign the closest fitting analysis on the basis of initial training on the LOB treebank and automatic updating of its statistical data on the basis of further parsed examples.
The probability function can be obtained on the basis of a treebank, as proposed by (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993). $$$$$ In addition, the analyses assigned, on the basis of the LOB treebank scheme, are not syntactically determinate (for example, syntactic relations in unbounded dependency constructions are not represented).

The model by (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993) however incorporated a mistake involving lookahead, which was corrected by (Inui et al, 2000). $$$$$ The Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) system is a wide-coverage lexical, morphological, and syntactic analysis system for English (Briscoe et al. 1987).
The model by (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993) however incorporated a mistake involving lookahead, which was corrected by (Inui et al, 2000). $$$$$ In what follows, we will assume that the unification-based grammars we are considering are represented in the ANLT object grammar formalism (Briscoe et al. 1987).

One important assumption that is made by (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993) and (Inui et al, 2000) is that trained probabilistic LR parsers should be proper. $$$$$ In the following sections, we introduce the LR parser and in Section 8 Ted Briscoe and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing we demonstrate that LR parse tables do provide an appropriate amount of contextual information to solve the problems described above.
One important assumption that is made by (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993) and (Inui et al, 2000) is that trained probabilistic LR parsers should be proper. $$$$$ Ted Briscoe and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing Constructing the LR parse table directly and automatically from a unification grammar would avoid these drawbacks.

There have been many other attempts to process dictionary definitions using heuristic pattern matching (e.g., Chodorow et al 1985), specially constructed definition parsers (e.g., Wilks et al 1996, Vossen 1995), and even general coverage syntactic parsers (e.g., Briscoe and Carroll 1993). $$$$$ The Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) system is a wide-coverage lexical, morphological, and syntactic analysis system for English (Briscoe et al. 1987).

Our second method of acquiring verb grammatical relations uses the statistical parser developed by Briscoe and Carroll (1993, 1997) which is an extension of the ANLT grammar development system which we used for our deep grammatical analysis as reported in Section 3 above. $$$$$ The second method involves incremental interaction with the parser during the parse to guide it through the search space of possibilities.
