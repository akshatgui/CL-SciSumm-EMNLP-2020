This substitution technique has shown some improvement in translation quality (Callison-Burch et al, 2006). $$$$$ In this paper we have shown that significant gains in coverage and translation quality can be had by integrating paraphrases into statistical machine translation.

Typical examples are paraphrasing using bilingual (Callison-Burch et al, 2006) or monolingual (Quirket al, 2004) data. $$$$$ Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) use bilingual parallel corpora to generate paraphrases.

We carried out experiments on small, medium and large scale English-Chinese translation tasks to compare against a baseline PBSMT system, the translation model augmentation of (Callison-Burch et al, 2006) method and the word-lattice-based method of (Du et al., 2010) to show the effectiveness of our novel approach. $$$$$ By grams, and 4-grams from the Europarl Spanish test sentences for which translations were learned in increasingly large training corpora increasing the size of the basic unit of translation, phrase-based machine translation does away with many of the problems associated with the original word-based formulation of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).

Callison-Burch et al (2006) argue that limited amounts of parallel training data can lead to the problem of low coverage in that many phrases encountered at run-time are not observed in the training data and so their translations will not be learned. $$$$$ For these language pairs a huge portion of phrases encountered at run-time will be unknown.

Callison-Burch et al (2006) proposed a novel method which substitutes a paraphrase for an unknown source word or phrase in the input sentence, and then proceeds to use the translation of that paraphrase in the production of the target-language result. $$$$$ Specifically we show that upon encountering an unknown source phrase, we can substitute a paraphrase for it and then proceed using the translation of that paraphrase.

system performs slightly better (0.36 absolute BLEU points) than the baseline system on the 20K data set, but slightly worse (0.19 absolute BLEU points) than the baseline on the 200K data set, which indicates that the paraphrase substitution method used in (Callison-Burch et al, 2006) does not work on resource-sufficient data sets. $$$$$ We manage the parallel corpora with a suffix array -based data structure (Callison-Burch et al., 2005).

Callison-Burch et al (2006) exploited the existence of multiple parallel corpora to learn paraphrases for Phrase-based MT. $$$$$ We can extend the definition of the paraphrase probability to include multiple corpora, as follows

For example, according to Callison-Burch et al (2006), a SMT system with a training corpus of 10,000 words learned only 10% of the vocabulary; the same system learned about 30% with a training corpus of 100,000 words; and even with a large training corpus of nearly 10,000,000 words it only reached about 90% coverage of the source vocabulary. $$$$$ For a training corpus containing 10,000 words translations will have been learned for only 10% of the unigrams (types, not tokens).
