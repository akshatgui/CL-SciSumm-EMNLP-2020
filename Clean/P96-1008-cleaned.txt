This use of model-theoretic interpretation represents an important extension to thesemantic grammars used in existing statistical spoken language interfaces, which rely on co-occurrences among lexically-determined semantic classes and slot fillers (Miller et al, 1996), in that the probability of an analysis is now also conditioned on the existence of denoted entities and relations in the world model. $$$$$ A Fully Statistical Approach To Natural Language Interfaces

Examples include an early statistical method for learning to fill slot-value representations (Miller et al, 1996) and a more recent approach for recovering semantic parse trees (Ge & Mooney, 2006). $$$$$ Some key advantages to statistical modeling techniques are

An influential precursor to this integration is the system described in (Miller et al, 1996). $$$$$ The parsing model is a probabilistic recursive transition network similar to those described in (Miller et al. 1994) and (Seneff 1992).

Evaluation Metrics Miller et al (1996) report accuracy rates for recovering correct SQL annotations on the test set. $$$$$ In this test, the system was trained on approximately 4000 ATIS 2 and ATIS 3 sentences, and then evaluated on the December 1994 test material (which was held aside as a blind test set).

In the domain of the Air Traveler Information System (Miller et al, 1996) the authors apply statistical methods to compute the probability that a constituent can fill in a semantic slot within a semantic frame. $$$$$ More recently, statistical methods have been applied to domain-specific semantic parsing (Miller et al. 1994), and to the more difficult problem of wide-coverage syntactic parsing (Magerman 1995).
In the domain of the Air Traveler Information System (Miller et al, 1996) the authors apply statistical methods to compute the probability that a constituent can fill in a semantic slot within a semantic frame. $$$$$ To evaluate our approach, we trained an experimental system using data from the Air Travel Information (ATIS) domain (Bates et al. 1990; Price 1990).

For example, in the context of the Air Traveler Information System (ATIS) for spoken dialogue, Miller et al (1996) computed the probability that a constituent such as Atlanta filled a semantic slot such as Destination in a semantic frame for air travel. $$$$$ To evaluate our approach, we trained an experimental system using data from the Air Travel Information (ATIS) domain (Bates et al. 1990; Price 1990).
