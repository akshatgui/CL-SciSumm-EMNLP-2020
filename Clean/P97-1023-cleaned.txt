Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) presented a method for automatically assigning a + or - orientation label to adjectives known to have some semantic orientation. $$$$$ In this paper, we present and evaluate a method that automatically retrieves semantic orientation information using indirect information collected from a large corpus.

In this paper, we use the model labels assigned by hand by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, and tile labels automatically obtained by their method and reported in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) with the following extension: An adjective that appears in k conjunctions will receive (possibly different) labels when analyzed together with all adjectives appearing in at least 2, 3 ..., k conjunctions. $$$$$ The operations of selecting adjectives and assigning labels were performed before testing our conjunction hypothesis or implementing any other algorithms, to avoid any influence on our labels.

The features developed in lhis paper are not only good clues of subjectivity, they can be Mentilied automatically from corpora (see (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), and Section 3 in the present paper). $$$$$ In this paper, we present and evaluate a method that automatically retrieves semantic orientation information using indirect information collected from a large corpus.

We are using the observations about conjunctive constructions from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) in our approach. $$$$$ We then assigned an orientation label (either + or —) to each adjective, using an evaluative approach.
We are using the observations about conjunctive constructions from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) in our approach. $$$$$ However, we can improve performance by noting that conjunctions using but exhibit the opposite pattern, usually involving adjectives of different orientations.

As explained by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), two opinion terms appearing in a conjunctive constructions tend to have semantic orientations with the same or opposite directions, depending on the conjunction employed. $$$$$ In addition, almost all antonyms have different semantic orientations.'

Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) determine the polarity of adjectives by mining pairs of conjoined adjectives from text, and observing that conjunctions such as and tend to conjoin adjectives of the same polarity while conjunctions such as but tend to conjoin adjectives of opposite polarity. $$$$$ We identify and validate from a large corpus constraints from conjunctions on the positive or negative semantic orientation of the conjoined adjectives.

Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) clustered adjectives into (+) and (-) sets based on conjunction constructions, weighted similarity graphs, minimum-cuts, supervised learning, and clustering. $$$$$ Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative.
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) clustered adjectives into (+) and (-) sets based on conjunction constructions, weighted similarity graphs, minimum-cuts, supervised learning, and clustering. $$$$$ As part of our clustering algorithm's output, a &quot;goodness-of-fit&quot; measure for each word is computed, based on Rousseeuw's (1987) silhouettes.

One of the earliest work on learning polarity of terms was by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) who deduce polarity by exploiting constraints on conjoined adjectives in the Wall Street Journal corpus. $$$$$ For our experiments, we use the 21 million word 1987 Wall Street Journal corpus', automatically annotated with part-of-speech tags using the PARTS tagger (Church, 1988).

 $$$$$ To further validate our set of labeled adjectives, we subsequently asked four people to independently label a randomly drawn sample of 500 of these adjectives.
 $$$$$ We also thank Dragomir Radev, Eric Siegel, and Gregory Sean McKinley who provided models for the categorization of the adjectives in our training and testing sets as positive and negative.

The work of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) is among the earliest efforts that addressed this problem. $$$$$ However, it will in general find a local minimum rather than the global one; the problem is NP-complete (Garey and Johnson, 1979).
The work of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) is among the earliest efforts that addressed this problem. $$$$$ We have previously shown (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1995) that in oppositions of gradable adjectives where one member is semantically unmarked, the unmarked member is the most frequent one about 81% of the time.

We used the list of labeled seeds from (Hatzivassiloglouand McKeown, 1997) and (Stone et al, 1966). $$$$$ Given that semantically similar words can be identified automatically on the basis of distributional properties and linguistic cues (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), identifying the semantic orientation of words would allow a system to further refine the retrieved semantic similarity relationships, extracting antonyms.
We used the list of labeled seeds from (Hatzivassiloglouand McKeown, 1997) and (Stone et al, 1966). $$$$$ Unfortunately, dictionaries and similar sources (theusari, WordNet (Miller et al., 1990)) do not include semantic orientation information .2 Explicit links between antonyms and synonyms may also be lacking, particularly when they depend on the domain of discourse; for example, the opposition bear— bull appears only in stock market reports, where the two words take specialized meanings.

In previous work, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) proposed a method to identify the polarity of adjectives based on conjunctions linking them in a large corpus. $$$$$ We identify and validate from a large corpus constraints from conjunctions on the positive or negative semantic orientation of the conjoined adjectives.

For example, Hatzivassiloglou (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and Kanayama (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) used conjunction rules to solve this problem from large domain corpora. $$$$$ Because the method relies on the corpus, it extracts domain-dependent information and automatically adapts to a new domain when the corpus is changed.
For example, Hatzivassiloglou (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and Kanayama (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) used conjunction rules to solve this problem from large domain corpora. $$$$$ We used these constraints to automatically construct a log-linear regression model, which, combined with supplementary morphology rules, predicts whether two conjoined adjectives are of same In each figure, the last x coordinate indicates the d the dotted line shows the performance of a random or different orientation with 82% accuracy.

For sentiment, the authors use a seed set of positive and negative adjectives, and iteratively propagate sentiment polarity through conjunction relations (like those used by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997, above). $$$$$ The final set contained 1,336 adjectives (657 positive and 679 negative terms).

Our method for determining sentiment polarity is based on an adaptation of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997). $$$$$ To partition the graph nodes into subsets of the same orientation, we employ an iterative optimization procedure on each connected component, based on the exchange method, a nonhierarchical clustering algorithm (Sp5,th, 1985).

In each case, OPINE makes use of local constraints on label assignments (e.g., conjunctions and disjunctions constraining the assignment of SO labels to words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997)). $$$$$ We identify and validate from a large corpus constraints from conjunctions on the positive or negative semantic orientation of the conjoined adjectives.
In each case, OPINE makes use of local constraints on label assignments (e.g., conjunctions and disjunctions constraining the assignment of SO labels to words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997)). $$$$$ To accomplish that, we use a simple criterion that applies only to pairs or groups of words of opposite orientation.

Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) proposed a method for identifying word polarity of adjectives. $$$$$ The semantic orientation or polarity of a word indicates the direction the word deviates from the norm for its semantic group or lexical field (Lehrer, 1974).

Following the method presented in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), we can connect words if they appear in a conjunctive form in the corpus. $$$$$ The system identifies and uses this indirect information in the following stages: In the following sections, we first present the set of adjectives used for training and evaluation.
Following the method presented in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), we can connect words if they appear in a conjunctive form in the corpus. $$$$$ Same and different-orientation links between adjectives form a graph.
