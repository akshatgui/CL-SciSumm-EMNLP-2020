The data we used for our experiments are developed as part of the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al, 2006) and they come from a variety of sources. $$$$$ Omega, which has been used for MT, summarization, and database alignment, has been assembled semi-automatically by merging a variety of sources, including Princeton’s WordNet, New Mexico State University’s Mikrokosmos, and a variety of Upper Models, including DOLCE (Gangemi et al., 2002), SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001), and ISI’s Upper Model, which are in the process of being reconciled.

However, the CoNLL data sets come from OntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006), where singleton entities are not annotated, and BLANC has a wider dynamic range on data sets with singletons (Recasens and Hovy, 2011). $$$$$ Sets of senses under specific nodes of the tree are grouped together into single entries, along with the syntactic and semantic criteria for their groupings, to be presented to the annotators.

The second set is radically different as it comprised 750 pairs of glosses from OntoNotes 4.0 (Hovy et al, 2006) and WordNet 3.1 (Fellbaum, 1998) senses. $$$$$ Building on results in grouping fine-grained WordNet senses into more coarse-grained senses that led to improved inter-annotator agreement (ITA) and system performance (Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2006), we have developed a process for rapid sense inventory creation and annotation that includes critical links between the grouped word senses and the Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2005; see Section 5 below).

OntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006) is a project that has annotated several layers of semantic information including word senses, at a high inter-annotator agreement of over 90%. $$$$$ We have developed a methodology for producing such a corpus at 90% inter-annotator agreement, and will release completed segments beginning in early 2007.

In this work we focus on two datasets of hand-labeled sense groupings for WordNet: first, a dataset of sense groupings over nouns, verbs, and adjectives provided as part of the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample WSD task (Kilgarriff, 2001), and second, a corpus-driven mapping of nouns and verbs in WordNet 2.1 to the Omega Ontology (Philpot et al, 2005), produced as part of the ONTONOTES project (Hovy et al, 2006). $$$$$ Building on results in grouping fine-grained WordNet senses into more coarse-grained senses that led to improved inter-annotator agreement (ITA) and system performance (Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2006), we have developed a process for rapid sense inventory creation and annotation that includes critical links between the grouped word senses and the Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2005; see Section 5 below).

We then merged the word alignment annotation with the TreeBank and PropBank annotation of Ontonotes4.0 (Hovy et al, 2006), which includes a wide array of data sources like broadcast news, news wire, magazine, web text, etc. $$$$$ Annotation will cover multiple languages (English, Chinese, and Arabic) and multiple genres (newswire, broadcast news, news groups, weblogs, etc.

Suggestions came from the previous named entity annotation of PERSONs, organizations (GROUP), and LOCATIONs, as well as heuristic lookup in lexical resources - Arabic WordNet entries (Elkateb et al, 2006) mapped to English WordNet, and named entities in OntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006). $$$$$ Building on results in grouping fine-grained WordNet senses into more coarse-grained senses that led to improved inter-annotator agreement (ITA) and system performance (Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2006), we have developed a process for rapid sense inventory creation and annotation that includes critical links between the grouped word senses and the Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2005; see Section 5 below).

The OntoNotes 90% solution (Hovy et al 2006) actually means such a degree of granularity that enables a 90% IAA. $$$$$ We describe the OntoNotes methodology and its result, a large multilingual richly-annotated corpus constructed at 90% interannotator agreement.

The corpus consists of texts of the Wall Street Journal corpus, and is hand-tagged with OntoNotes senses (Hovy et al, 2006). $$$$$ The 1M word Penn Treebank II Wall Street Journal corpus has been successfully annotated with semantic argument structures for verbs and is now available via the Penn Linguistic Data Consortium as PropBank I (Palmer et al., 2005).

However, the performance of our model, trained using the OntoNotes corpus (Hovy et al, 2006), fell short of separate parsing and named entity models trained on larger corpora, annotated with only one type of information. $$$$$ Until now, however, no such model has been identified that can be annotated dependably and rapidly.
