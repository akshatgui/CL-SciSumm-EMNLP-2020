Turney (2008) argues that many NLP tasks can be formulated in terms of analogical reasoning, and he applies his PairClass algorithm to a number of problems including SAT verbal analogy tests, synonym/antonym classification and distinction between semantically similar and semantically associated words. $$$$$ We introduce a supervised corpus-based machine learning algorithm for classifying analogous word pairs, and we show that it can solve multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, TOEFL synonymquestions, ESL synonym-antonym questions, and similar-associated-both ques tions from cognitive psychology.

Such tasks will require an extension of the current framework of Turney (2008) beyond evidence from the direct co-occurrence of target word pairs. $$$$$ The task of classifying word pairs as either syn onyms or antonyms readily fits into the framework of supervised classification of word pairs.

Turney (2008) presents a general approach for classifying word pairs into semantic relations by extracting the strings occurring between the two words of a pair (up to three words in-between, up to one word on either side) and using a frequency-based selection process to select sub-patterns where words from the extracted context pattern may have been replaced by a wild card. $$$$$ A pair of words (petrify

Building on a recent proposal in this direction by Turney (2008), we propose a generic method of this sort, and we test it on a set of unrelated tasks, reporting good performance across the board with very little task-specific tweaking. $$$$$ The output of the algorithm is anassignment of labels to the word pairs in the test ing set.
