Turney (2008) has recently proposed a simpler SVM-based algorithm for analogical classification called PairClass. $$$$$ PairClass uses a support vector machine (SVM) instead of a nearest neighbour (NN) learning algorithm.

Turney (2008) argues that many NLP tasks can be formulated in terms of analogical reasoning, and he applies his PairClass algorithm to a number of problems including SAT verbal analogy tests, synonym/antonym classification and distinction between semantically similar and semantically associated words. $$$$$ We introduce a supervised corpus-based machine learning algorithm for classifying analogous word pairs, and we show that it can solve multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, TOEFL synonymquestions, ESL synonym-antonym questions, and similar-associated-both ques tions from cognitive psychology.

In particular, (Turney, 2008) tackled the problem of classifying different lexical information such as synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy and association by using context words. $$$$$ We may view the task of recognizing word analogies as a problem of classifying word pairs (see Table 1).

Turney (2008) recently advocated the need for a uniform approach to corpus-based semantic tasks. $$$$$ However, weprefer to take a corpus-based approach to seman tics.

Such tasks will require an extension of the current framework of Turney (2008) beyond evidence from the direct co-occurrence of target word pairs. $$$$$ The target pair is called the stem.
Such tasks will require an extension of the current framework of Turney (2008) beyond evidence from the direct co-occurrence of target word pairs. $$$$$ The task of classifying word pairs as either syn onyms or antonyms readily fits into the framework of supervised classification of word pairs.

Turney (2008) presents a general approach for classifying word pairs into semantic relations by extracting the strings occurring between the two words of a pair (up to three words in-between, up to one word on either side) and using a frequency-based selection process to select sub-patterns where words from the extracted context pattern may have been replaced by a wild card. $$$$$ A pair of words (petrify:stone) is analogous to another pair (vaporize:gas) when the semantic re lations between the words in the first pair are highly similar to the relations in the second pair.

Building on a recent proposal in this direction by Turney (2008), we propose a generic method of this sort, and we test it on a set of unrelated tasks, reporting good performance across the board with very little task-specific tweaking. $$$$$ The output of the algorithm is anassignment of labels to the word pairs in the test ing set.

Turney (2008) is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to raise the issue of a unified approach. $$$$$ For example, consider the knowledge en coded in WordNet: much of the knowledge in WordNet is embedded in the graph structure that connects words.

We adopt a similar approach to the one used in Turney (2008) and consider each question as a separate bi nary classification problem with one positive training instance and 5 unknown pairs. $$$$$ Turney (2006) used a corpus-based algorithm.We may view Table 2 as a binary classification problem, in which mason:stone and carpen ter:wood are positive examples and the remaining word pairs are negative examples.
