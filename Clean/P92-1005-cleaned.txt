This led to the development of underspecified semantic representations (e.g. QLF, Alshawi and Crouch (1992) and MRS, Copestake et al (2005)) which are easier to produce from text without contextual inference but which can be further specified as necessary for the task being performed. $$$$$ A 'twolevel' approach to semantic interpretation tends to result (Bronneberg et al. 1980), where an initial, underspecified representation is transformed into a separate, specified, representation.

In contrast to statements of a fully specified logic in which denotations are typically taken to be functions from possible worlds to truth values (Montague, 1973), denotations of a statement in an under specified logic are typically taken to be relations between possible worlds and truth values (Alshawi and Crouch (1992), Alshawi (1996)). $$$$$ .]] for QLFs in terms of a relation W between formulas, models and truth values.
In contrast to statements of a fully specified logic in which denotations are typically taken to be functions from possible worlds to truth values (Montague, 1973), denotations of a statement in an under specified logic are typically taken to be relations between possible worlds and truth values (Alshawi and Crouch (1992), Alshawi (1996)). $$$$$ Unresolved QLFs behave more like open formulas, and there is an analogy between assignments to unbound variables in predicate logic and possible resolutions of meta-variables admitted by the salience relation S. S(C,H) should be thought of as providing QLF expressions whose denotations are possible referents for unresolved expressions with category C. (It would have been possible to define S as a direct relation between categories and referents, but this complicates the statement of its role in resolution and in the semantic definitions.)

Secondly, monotonicity guarantees that interpretation algorithms can proceed incrementally, combining information from various sources in a nondestructive way (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ Monotonicity guarantees that the grammatical analysis of a sentence can proceed incrementally by combining information from rules and lexical entries in a nondestructive way.
Secondly, monotonicity guarantees that interpretation algorithms can proceed incrementally, combining information from various sources in a nondestructive way (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ By contrast, the annotation of QLFs with scope lists provides an extra level of information about how the derivations proceed.

First, a quasi logical form allows the under-specification of several types of information, such as anaphoric references, ellipsis and semantic relations (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992). $$$$$ The paper describes how monotonic reference resolution and scoping can be carried out using a revised Quasi Logical Form (QLF) representation.
