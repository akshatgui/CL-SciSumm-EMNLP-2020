In addition, we also analyze CCM's sensitivity to initialization, and compare our results to Seginer's algorithm (Seginer, 2007). $$$$$ This step becomes superfluous in the algorithm I present here: the algorithm collects lists of labels for each word, based on neighboring words, and then directly uses these labels to parse.

The parser of Seginer (2007) performs slightly better on CTB 5.0 sentences no more than 10 words, but obviously falls behind on sentences no more than 40 words. $$$$$ No clustering is performed, but due to the Zipfian distribution of words, high frequency words dominate these lists and parsing decisions for words of similar distribution are guided by the same labels.

 $$$$$ For each representative subset R C_ this defines a unique shortest common cover link set (see figure 1(c)).
 $$$$$ The same conclusion cannot be drawn from a negative value for the In property when l = (w, 1) because, as with standard dependencies, a word determines its outbound links much more strongly than its inbound links.

As pre-processing, we use an unsupervised parser that generates an unlabeled parse tree for each sentence (Seginer, 2007). $$$$$ All these parsers learn and parse from sequences of part-of-speech tags and select, for each sentence, the binary parse tree which maximizes some objective function.

Though punctuation is usually entirely ignored in unsupervised parsing research, Seginer (2007) departs from this in one key aspect: the use of phrasal punctuation - punctuation symbols that often mark phrasal boundaries within a sentence. $$$$$ The update of Axi by a is given by operations The update of Axi by a begins by incrementing the count: #(Axi ) += 1 If a is a boundary symbol (0l or 0r) or if x and a are words separated by stopping punctuation (full stop, question mark, exclamation mark, semicolon, comma or dash): (In practice, only l = [a] and the 10 strongest labels in AαSign(−i) are updated.
