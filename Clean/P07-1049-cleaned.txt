Seginer (2007) has an incremental parsing approach using a novel representation called common-cover-links, which can be converted to constituent brackets. $$$$$ The parser uses a representation for syntactic structure similar to dependency links which is well-suited for incremental parsing.

In addition, we also analyze CCM's sensitivity to initialization, and compare our results to Seginer's algorithm (Seginer, 2007). $$$$$ This step becomes superfluous in the algorithm I present here

The parser of Seginer (2007) performs slightly better on CTB 5.0 sentences no more than 10 words, but obviously falls behind on sentences no more than 40 words. $$$$$ No clustering is performed, but due to the Zipfian distribution of words, high frequency words dominate these lists and parsing decisions for words of similar distribution are guided by the same labels.
The parser of Seginer (2007) performs slightly better on CTB 5.0 sentences no more than 10 words, but obviously falls behind on sentences no more than 40 words. $$$$$ Words which have not yet been read are not available to the parser at this stage.

 $$$$$ For each representative subset R C_ this defines a unique shortest common cover link set (see figure 1(c)).
 $$$$$ The same conclusion cannot be drawn from a negative value for the In property when l = (w, 1) because, as with standard dependencies, a word determines its outbound links much more strongly than its inbound links.

As pre-processing, we use an unsupervised parser that generates an unlabeled parse tree for each sentence (Seginer, 2007). $$$$$ All these parsers learn and parse from sequences of part-of-speech tags and select, for each sentence, the binary parse tree which maximizes some objective function.

For example, the Seginer (2007) parser achieves an F-score of 75.9% on the WSJ10 corpus and 59% on the NEGRA10 corpus, but the percentage of individual sentences with an F-score of 100% is 21.5% for WSJ10 and 11% for NEGRA10. $$$$$ Learning is based on global maximization of this objective function over the whole corpus.
