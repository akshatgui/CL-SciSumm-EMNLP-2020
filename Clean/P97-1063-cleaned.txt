All translation models were induced using the method of Melamed (1997). $$$$$ More accurate models can be induced by taking into account various features of the linked tokens.
All translation models were induced using the method of Melamed (1997). $$$$$ We induced a two-class word-to-word model of translational equivalence from 13 million words of the Canadian Hansards, aligned using the method in (Gale & Church, 1991).

SWAT considers only those translations c that has been linked with w based the Competitive Linking Algorithm (Melamed 1997) and logarithmic likelihood ratio (Dunning 1993). $$$$$ An 'Note that k(u,„) depends on the linking algorithm, but n(„,„.) is a constant property of the bitext. important property of the competitive linking algorithm is that the ratio k(uv)/n(u) tends to be very high if u and v are mutual translations, and quite low if they are not.
SWAT considers only those translations c that has been linked with w based the Competitive Linking Algorithm (Melamed 1997) and logarithmic likelihood ratio (Dunning 1993). $$$$$ The ratio of these probabilities is the likelihood ratio in favor of u and v being mutual translations, for all u and v

In its basic form the Competitive Linking algorithm (Melamed, 1997) allows for only up to one link per word. $$$$$ The competitive linking algorithm implements this heuristic

The selection order is similar to that in the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed, 1997). $$$$$ The competitive linking algorithm implements this heuristic

The first algorithm is similar to Competitive Linking (Melamed, 1997). $$$$$ The competitive linking algorithm implements this heuristic

In this paper, we describe the key idea behind this model and connect it with the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed, 1997) which was developed for word-to-word alignment. $$$$$ The simplicity of the competitive linking algorithm depends on the one-to-one assumption

The competitive linking algorithm (CLA) (Melamed, 1997) is a greedy word alignment algorithm. $$$$$ The competitive linking algorithm implements this heuristic

(Melamed,1997) has proposed the Competitive Linking Algorithm for linking the word pairs and a method which calculates the optimized correspondence level of the word pairs by hill climbing. $$$$$ The competitive linking algorithm implements this heuristic

Every English word has either 0 or 1 alignments (Melamed, 1997). $$$$$ The IBM models are directional; i.e. they posit the English words that gave rise to each French word, but ignore the distribution of the English words.
Every English word has either 0 or 1 alignments (Melamed, 1997). $$$$$ &quot;Partial links&quot; are those where one French word resulted from multiple English words, but the model only links the French word to one of its English sources.

The problem, which was described in (Melamed, 1997) in a word-to-word alignment context, is as follows $$$$$ A Word-To-Word Model Of Translational Equivalence
The problem, which was described in (Melamed, 1997) in a word-to-word alignment context, is as follows $$$$$ The arrow connecting vk and uk±i in Figure 1 represents an indirect association, since the association between vk and uk±i arises only by virtue of the association between each of them and uk .

EM is then performed by first discovering an initial phrasal alignments using a greedy algorithm similar to the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed, 1997). $$$$$ After initialization, the model induction algorithm iterates

 $$$$$ A link type is an ordered pair of word types.
 $$$$$ This research was supported by an equipment grant from Sun MicroSystems and by ARPA Contract #N66001-94C-6043.

This can be seen as a generalization of the one-to-one assumption for word-to-word translation used by Melamed (1997a) and is exploited for the same purpose, i.e. to exclude large numbers of candidate alignments, when good initial alignments have been found. $$$$$ The simplicity of the competitive linking algorithm depends on the one-to-one assumption

The basic algorithm combines the K-vec approach, described by Fung and Church (1993), with the greedy word-to-word algorithm of Melamed (1997a). $$$$$ With the exception of (Fung, 1995b), previous methods for automatically constructing statistical translation models begin by looking at word cooccurrence frequencies in bitexts (Gale & Church, 1991; Kumano & Hirakawa, 1994; Fung, 1995a; Melamed, 1995).
The basic algorithm combines the K-vec approach, described by Fung and Church (1993), with the greedy word-to-word algorithm of Melamed (1997a). $$$$$ In the basic word-to-word model, the hidden parameters A+ and A- depend only on the distributions of link frequencies generated by the competitive linking algorithm.

Equivalents in Bilingual Corpus When accurate instances are obtained from bilingual corpus, we continue to integrate the statistical word-alignment techniques (Melamed, 1997) and dictionaries to find the translation candidates for each of the two collocates. $$$$$ (Macklovitch, 1994; Melamed, 1996b)), concordancing for bilingual lexicography (Catizone et al., 1993; Gale & Church, 1991), computerassisted language learning, corpus linguistics (Melby.
Equivalents in Bilingual Corpus When accurate instances are obtained from bilingual corpus, we continue to integrate the statistical word-alignment techniques (Melamed, 1997) and dictionaries to find the translation candidates for each of the two collocates. $$$$$ Machine readable bilingual dictionaries, even when they are available, have only limited coverage and rarely include domain-specific terms (Resnik & Melamed, 1997).
