In this paper, we describe the key idea behind this model and connect it with the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed, 1997) which was developed for word-to-word alignment. $$$$$ The simplicity of the competitive linking algorithm depends on the one-to-one assumption: Each word translates to at most one other word.

The problem, which was described in (Melamed, 1997) in a word-to-word alignment context, is as follows: if e1 is the translation of f1 and f2 has a strong monolingual association with f1, e1 and f2 will also have a strong correlation. $$$$$ A Word-To-Word Model Of Translational Equivalence

This can be seen as a generalization of the one-to-one assumption for word-to-word translation used by Melamed (1997a) and is exploited for the same purpose, i.e. to exclude large numbers of candidate alignments, when good initial alignments have been found. $$$$$ The simplicity of the competitive linking algorithm depends on the one-to-one assumption: Each word translates to at most one other word.
