Shieber (1988) claims that the problem of logical equivalence reduces to the knowledge representation problem. $$$$$ Finally, on a more pessimistic note, we turn to a widespread problem in all systems for automatic generation of natural language, which Ap- pelt [1987] has discussed under the rubric "the problem of logical-form equivalence".
Shieber (1988) claims that the problem of logical equivalence reduces to the knowledge representation problem. $$$$$ The problem is complicated further in that, strictly speaking, the class of equivalent logical forms from the standpoint of generation is not really closed under logical equivalence.

Two further problems are the treatment of unary rules and functors with what Shieber (1988) calls vestigial semantics, which we prefer to call identity semantics. $$$$$ However, several problems immediately present hemselves.

The obvious solution is to use a lemma table or chart (as discussed by Pereira and Warren 1984 and Shieber 1988). $$$$$ The traditional solution to this problem is to store lemmas in a table, i.e., the well-formed-substring table or chart in tabular parsing algorithms.

Shieber (1988) states that to guarantee completeness in using a precomputed entry in the chart, the entry must subsume the formula being generated top-down. $$$$$ Nonconditional i tems formed by immediate inference from a lexieal entry will be called lexical items.

Shieber (1988) gave the first use of Earley's algorithm for generation, but this algorithm does not. $$$$$ In particular, Pereira and Warren construct a parsing algorithm us- ing a deduction strategy which mimics Earleys algorithm.
Shieber (1988) gave the first use of Earley's algorithm for generation, but this algorithm does not. $$$$$ The exhaustive use of prediction and completion as basic inference rules does provide a complete algorithm for proving lemmas of the sort described.

As Shieber (1988) noted, the main shortcoming of Earley generation is a lack of goal-directedness that results in a proliferation of edges. $$$$$ It should be noted that this kind of problem is quite deep.

In generation, as Shieber (1988) and Appelt (1989) observe, a situation may arise in which the representation supplied as input to the process (perhaps by another program) is not itself directly suitable, but is logically equivalent to one that is. The use of distinct grammars for parsing and generation could provide a solution to this problem, but it raises others connected with management of the resulting system. $$$$$ A simple solution to this problem is to ignore the string positions in the generation process.

As (Shieber, 1988) showed, the problem with such words is that they can not be selected on the basis of the input semantics. $$$$$ However, other phrases composed of the same words, such as Knit loves Knit, Sonny is loved, and so forth, are eliminated by the semantics filter.

In (Shieber, 1988), a chart-based bottom-up generator is presented which is devoid of an indexing scheme: all word edges leave and enter the same vertex and as a result, interactions must be considered explicitly between new edges and all edges currently in the chart. $$$$$ This technique, a sort of indexing on meaning, replaces the indexing on string position that is more appropriate for parsing than generation.

Shieber (1988) showed that parsing charts can be also used in generation and raised the question, which we take up again here, of whether they constitute a natural uniform architecture for parsing and generation. $$$$$ A Uniform Architecture for Parsing and Generation Stuart M. SHIEBER Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International Menlo Park, California, USA* Abst rac t The use of a single grammar for both parsing and generation is an idea with a certain elegance, the desirability of which several researchers have noted.

In this respect, it differs from the proposal of Shieber (1988) which starts with all word edges leaving and entering a single vertex. $$$$$ Thus we need insert the lexicon only once, each word being inserted at the single position, e.g., [0, sonny ,  0].

In generation, examples of such extended processing strategies are head corner generation with its semantic linking (Shieber et al, 1990) or bottom-up (Earley) generation with a semantic filter (Shieber, 1988). $$$$$ [Shieber, 1983] Stuart M. Shieber.

The use of such a semantic filter in bottom-up evaluation requires the grammar to obey the semantic monotonicity constraint in order to ensure completeness (Shieber, 1988) (see below). $$$$$ Semantic monotonicity is, by intention, a property of the particular grammar we have been using.
