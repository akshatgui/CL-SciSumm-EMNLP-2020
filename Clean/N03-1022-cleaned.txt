A third approach, exemplified by Moldovan et al (2003) and Raina et al (2005), is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasi logical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ The approach is to transform questions and answer passages into logic representations.

The two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axioms - as in Moldovan et al (2003). $$$$$ World knowledge axioms as well as linguistic axioms are supplied to the prover which renders a deep understanding of the relationship between question text and answer text.

Most of existing systems on the web produce a set of answers to a question in the form of hyper links or page extracts, ranked according to a relevance score (for example, COGEX [Moldovan et al, 2003]). $$$$$ When all the candidate answers are processed, the candidate answers are ranked based on their proof scores, with the output from COGEX being the ranked answers and the answer justifications.

Our system uses COGEX (Moldovan et al, 2003), a natural language prover originating from OT TER (McCune, 1994). $$$$$ COGEX: A Logic Prover For Question Answering
Our system uses COGEX (Moldovan et al, 2003), a natural language prover originating from OT TER (McCune, 1994). $$$$$ Thus, some questions are answered by the QA system without the prover, some only by the prover and some by both the non-prover system and the prover.

This assumption, also made by other recent abductive approaches (Moldovanetal., 2003), does not hold for several classes of examples. $$$$$ We call these NLP axioms and present below some examples together with questions that call them.

In COGEX (Moldovan et al, 2003), a recent QA system, authors used automated reasoning for QA and showed that it is feasible, effective and scalable. $$$$$ In this paper we introduce one such novel idea, the use of automated reasoning in QA, and show that it is feasible, effective, and scalable.

Moldovan et al (2003) describe a method similar to ours. $$$$$ Similar to the above issue, a question may refer to the subject/object in an abbreviated form, while the answer will refer to the subject/object in its full, proper form.

Continuing this work Moldovan et al (Moldovan et al, 2003) built a logic prover for Question Answering. $$$$$ This paper introduces the idea of automated reasoning applied to question answering and shows the feasibility of integrating a logic prover into a Question Answering system.

Wordnets and ontologies are very common resources and are employed in a wide variety of direct and indirect QA tasks, such as reasoning based on axioms extracted from WordNet (Moldovanetal., 2003). $$$$$ These axioms are provided by the WordNet glosses represented in logic forms.

COGEX (Moldovan et al, 2003) uses its logic prover to extract lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers. $$$$$ COGEX: A Logic Prover For Question Answering
COGEX (Moldovan et al, 2003) uses its logic prover to extract lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers. $$$$$ We have implemented a Logic Prover, called COGEX (from the permutation of the first two syllables of the verb excogitate) which uniformly codifies the question and answer text, as well as world knowledge resources, in order to use its inference engine to verify and extract any lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers.

a combination of language processes that transform questions and candidate answers in logic representations such that reasoning systems can select the correct answer based on their proofs (cf. (Moldovan et al., 2003)). $$$$$ The approach is to transform questions and answer passages into logic representations.

WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is perhaps the most popular resource and has been employed in a variety of QA-related tasks ranging from query expansion, to axiom-based reasoning (Moldovan et al., 2003), passage scoring (Paranjpe et al, 2003), and answer filtering (Leidner et al, 2004). $$$$$ Our solution is to integrate the prover into the QA system and rely on reasoning methods only to augment other previously implemented answer extraction techniques.
