A third approach, exemplified by Moldovan et al (2003) and Raina et al (2005), is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasi logical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of (Hobbs et al, 1988). $$$$$ The approach is to transform questions and answer passages into logic representations.

The two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axioms - as in Moldovan et al (2003). $$$$$ World knowledge axioms as well as linguistic axioms are supplied to the prover which renders a deep understanding of the relationship between question text and answer text.

Most of existing systems on the web produce a set of answers to a question in the form of hyper links or page extracts, ranked according to a relevance score (for example, COGEX [Moldovan et al, 2003]). $$$$$ When all the candidate answers are processed, the candidate answers are ranked based on their proof scores, with the output from COGEX being the ranked answers and the answer justifications.

In COGEX (Moldovan et al, 2003), a recent QA system, authors used automated reasoning for QA and showed that it is feasible, effective and scalable. $$$$$ In this paper we introduce one such novel idea, the use of automated reasoning in QA, and show that it is feasible, effective, and scalable.
In COGEX (Moldovan et al, 2003), a recent QA system, authors used automated reasoning for QA and showed that it is feasible, effective and scalable. $$$$$ Of these, 206 were answered by COGEX but some of these answers were also provided by QA system without COGEX.

Moldovan et al (2003) describe a method similar to ours. $$$$$ Similar to the above issue, a question may refer to the subject/object in an abbreviated form, while the answer will refer to the subject/object in its full, proper form.
Moldovan et al (2003) describe a method similar to ours. $$$$$ Additionally, similar to hyperresolution, paramodulation combines multiple substitution steps into one.

Wordnets and ontologies are very common resources and are employed in a wide variety of direct and indirect QA tasks, such as reasoning based on axioms extracted from WordNet (Moldovanetal., 2003). $$$$$ These axioms are provided by the WordNet glosses represented in logic forms.

WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is perhaps the most popular resource and has been employed in a variety of QA-related tasks ranging from query expansion, to axiom-based reasoning (Moldovan et al., 2003), passage scoring (Paranjpe et al, 2003), and answer filtering (Leidner et al, 2004). $$$$$ Our solution is to integrate the prover into the QA system and rely on reasoning methods only to augment other previously implemented answer extraction techniques.
