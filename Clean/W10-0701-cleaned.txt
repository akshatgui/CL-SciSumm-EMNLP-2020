A number of researchers have recently experimented with the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to create and evaluate human language data (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010). $$$$$ Creating Speech and Language Data With Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanical Turk
A number of researchers have recently experimented with the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to create and evaluate human language data (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010). $$$$$ A number of recent papers have evaluated the effectiveness of us ing Mechanical Turk to create annotated data for natural language processing applications.

Over the last several of years, Mechanical Turk, introduced by Amazon as artificial artificial intelligence, has been used successfully for a number of NLP tasks, including robust evaluation of machine translation systems by reading comprehension (Callison-Burch, 2009), and other tasks explored in the recent NAACL workshop (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010b). $$$$$ In the past two years, several papers have published about applying Mechanical Turk to a diverse set ofnatural language processing tasks, including

A number of mechanisms for quality control have been proposed for use with Mechanical Turk annotation (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010a). $$$$$ 3 3.1 Designing HITs for quality control.
A number of mechanisms for quality control have been proposed for use with Mechanical Turk annotation (Callison-Burch and Dredze, 2010a). $$$$$ Another class of quality control on Mechanical Turk is through iterative HITs that build on the output of previous HITs.
