An SAMT grammar (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) is similar to a Hiero grammar, except that the nonterminal symbol set is much larger, and its labels are derived from a parse tree over either the source or target side in the following manner. $$$$$ While (Chiang, 2005) uses only two nonterminal symbols in his grammar, we introduce multiple syntactic categories, taking advantage of a target language parser for this information.

Table 1 $$$$$ These rules can be viewed as phrase pairs with mixed lexical and non-terminal entries, where non-terminal entries (occurring as pairs in the source and target side) represent placeholders for inserting additional phrases pairs (which again may contain nonterminals) at decoding time.

For example, syntax is successfully integrated into hierarchical SMT (Zollmann and Venugopal,2006). $$$$$ In addition to the benefits that come from a more structured hierarchical rule set, we believe that these restrictions serve as a syntax driven language model that can guide the decoding process, as n-gram context based language models do in traditional decoding.

Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) started with a complete set of phrases as extracted by traditional PBMT heuristics, and then annotated the target side of each phrasal entry with the label of the constituent node in the target-side parse tree that subsumes the span. $$$$$ Annotation If the target side of any of these initial rules correspond to a syntactic category C of the target side parse tree, we label the phrase pair with that syntactic category.

Zollmann and Venugopal (2006) and Marcu et al (2006) used broken syntactic fragments to augment their grammars to increase the rule coverage; while we learn optimal tree fragments transformed from the original ones via a generative framework, they enumerate the fragments available from the original trees without learning process. $$$$$ Recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (Brown et al., 1993) and phrase based (Koehn et al., 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (Chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (Melamed, 2004).
