However, this method does not work for realworld datasets such as PASCAL RTE (Dagan et al., 2006), because of the knowledge bottleneck: it is often the case that the lack of sufficient linguistic knowledge causes failure of inference, thus the system outputs "no entailment" for almost all pairs (Bos and Markert, 2005). $$$$$ For a more exhaustive description of dataset design we refer the reader to (Dagan et al, 2005).

On PASCAL RTE datasets, strict logical inference is known to have very low recall (Bos and Markert, 2005), so on-the-fly knowledge is crucial in this setting. $$$$$ Recognising Textual Entailment With Logical Inference
On PASCAL RTE datasets, strict logical inference is known to have very low recall (Bos and Markert, 2005), so on-the-fly knowledge is crucial in this setting. $$$$$ In Section 4 we test their accuracy and robustness on the RTE datasets as one of the few currently available datasets for textual inference.

Bos and Markert (2005) proposes features from a model builder; Raina et al (2005) proposes an abduction process; Tatu and Moldovan (2006) shows handcrafted rules could drastically improve the performance of a logic-based RTE system. $$$$$ (For more information on model building consult (Blackburn and Bos, 2005)).
