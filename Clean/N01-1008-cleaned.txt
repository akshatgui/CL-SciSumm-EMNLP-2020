Similar observations are made by Harabagiu et al (2001), who point out that intelligent selection of positive instances can potentially minimize the amount of knowledge required to perform coreference resolution accurately. $$$$$ In our work, we approached the coreference resolution problem by trying to determine how much more knowledge is required to supplement the abovementioned knowledge-poor methods and how to derive that knowledge.

Examples of such scoring functions include the Dempster Shafer rule (see Kehler (1997) and Bean and Riloff (2004)) and its variants (see Harabagiu et al (2001) and Luo et al (2004)). $$$$$ 1997.

To expand our set of candidate partitions, we can potentially incorporate more high-performing coreference systems into our framework, which is flexible enough to accommodate even those that adopt knowledge-based (e.g., Harabagiu et al (2001)) and unsupervised approaches (e.g., Cardie and Wagstaff (1999), Bean and Riloff (2004)). $$$$$ CogNIAC

Vieira & Poesio (2000), Harabagiu et al (2001), and Markert & Nissim (2005) explore the use of WordNet for different coreference resolution subtasks, such as resolving bridging reference, other and definite NP anaphora, and MUC-style coreference resolution. $$$$$ Text And Knowledge Mining For Coreference Resolution

These measures are not specifically developed for coreference resolution but simply taken off-the-shelf and applied to our task without any specific tuning i.e. in contrast to Harabagiu et al. (2001), who weight WordNet relations differently in order to compute the confidence measure of the path. $$$$$ To determine the confidence of the path we consider three factors

In numerous articles the usefulness of this data and software ensemble has been demonstrated (e.g., for word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al, 2003), the analysis of noun phrase conjuncts (Hogan, 2007), or the resolution of coreferences (Harabagiu et al, 2001)). $$$$$ Computational methods based on linguistic and congitive information were presented in (Hobbs 1978), (Lappin and Leass 1994), (Brennan et al.1987), (Grosz et al.1995) and (Webber 1988).

Harabagiu et al (2001) use paths through Wordnet, using not only synonym and is-a relations, but also parts, morphological derivations, gloss texts and polysemy, which are weighted with a measure based on the relation types and number of path elements. $$$$$ For this purpose we assign the following weights to each relation considered

For example, motivated by the fact that some coreference relations are harder to identify than the others (see Harabagiu et al (2001)), Ng and Cardie (2002a) present a method for mining easy positive instances, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances that may complicate the acquisition of an accurate coreference model. $$$$$ Text And Knowledge Mining For Coreference Resolution

Results presented in Harabagiu et al (2001) are higher than those reported here, but assume that all and only the noun phrases involved in coreference relationships are provided for analysis by the coreference resolution system. $$$$$ Text And Knowledge Mining For Coreference Resolution

We also plan to investigate previous work on common noun phrase interpretation (e.g. Sidner (1979), Harabagiu et al (2001)) as a means of improving common noun phrase resolution, which remains a challenge for state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems. $$$$$ Text And Knowledge Mining For Coreference Resolution

Mining semantic information from WordNet We used the WordNet knowledge base to mine patterns of WordNet paths that connect pairs of coreferring nouns from the annotated chains.
