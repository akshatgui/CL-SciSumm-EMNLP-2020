Recent work by Chambers and Jurafsky (2011) approaches a related problem, applying agglomerative clustering over sentences to detect events, and then clustering syntactic constituents to induce the relevant fields of each event entity. $$$$$ We use agglomerative clustering with the above pairwise similarity metric.

Most recently, (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011) acquire event words from an external resource, group the event words to form event scenarios, and group extraction patterns for different event roles. $$$$$ We learn templates by first clustering event words based on their proximity in a training corpus.

The use of case frames is well grounded in a variety of NLP tasks relevant to summarization such as coreference resolution (Bean and Riloff, 2004), and information extraction (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), where they serve the central unit of semantic analysis. $$$$$ Template-Based Information Extraction without the Templates

We propose a method for inferring event templates based on word clustering according to their proximity in the corpus and syntactic function clustering. $$$$$ But instead, we propose a new method that obviates the need for even a limited human labeling of seed sets.

For example, Patwardhan and Riloff (2007) and Chambers and Jurafsky (2011) consider an IE approach where the extraction targets are MUC-4 style document-level templates (Sundheim, 1991), the former a supervised system and the latter fully unsupervised. $$$$$ We are the Riloff, 2007).

Efficiently storing such structures is an important step in integrating document-level statistics into downstream tasks, such as characterizing complex scenarios (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011), or story understanding (Gordon et al, 2011). $$$$$ Our previous work (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009) learned situation-specific roles over narrative schemas, similar to frame roles in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

Finally, unsupervised techniques (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011) have combined clustering, semantic roles, and syntactic relations in order to both construct and fill event templates. $$$$$ We learn the roles of cluster C by clustering the syntactic relations RC of its words.

(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011) (Poon and Domingos, 2010) (Chen et al 2011) focus on extracting frame-like structures (Baker et al 1998) by defining two types of clusters, event clusters and role clusters. $$$$$ There are many ways to represent events, ranging from role-based representations such as frames (Baker et al., 1998) to sequential events in scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977) and narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Kasch and Oates, 2010).

(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011) is similar to our approach in that it learns a semantic model, called template, from unlabelled news articles and then uses the template to extract information. $$$$$ Template-Based Information Extraction without the Templates
(Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011) is similar to our approach in that it learns a semantic model, called template, from unlabelled news articles and then uses the template to extract information. $$$$$ Standard algorithms for template-based information extraction (IE) require predefined template schemas, and often labeled data, to learn to extract their slot fillers (e.g., an the a template).

There has been work that attempts to fill predefined templates using Bayesian nonparametrics (Haghighi and Klein, 2010) and automatically learns template structures using agglomerative clustering (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011). $$$$$ Using this definition of distance, pointwise mutual information measures our similarity of two events

Our first baseline is PROFINDER, a state of-the-art template inducer which Cheung et al (2013) showed to outperform the previous heuristic clustering method of Chambers and Jurafsky (2011). $$$$$ We will extend Many template extraction algorithms require full their work by showing how to learn without these knowledge of the templates and labeled corpora, assumptions, obviating the need for redundant docsuch as in rule-based systems (Chinchor et al., 1993; uments, and learning templates with any type and Rau et al., 1992) and modern supervised classi- any number of slots. fiers (Freitag, 1998; Chieu et al., 2003; Bunescu Large-scale learning of scripts and narrative and Mooney, 2004; Patwardhan and Riloff, 2009). schemas also captures template-like knowledge Classifiers rely on the labeled examplesâ€™ surround- from unlabeled text (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; ing context for features such as nearby tokens, doc- Kasch and Oates, 2010).
