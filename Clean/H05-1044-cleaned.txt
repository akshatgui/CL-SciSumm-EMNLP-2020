Wilson et al (2005) proposed supervised learning, dividing the resources into prior polarity and context polarity, which are similar to polar atoms and syntactic patterns in this paper, respectively. $$$$$ For the first step, we concentrate on whether clue instances are neutral or polar in context (where polar in context refers to having a contextual polarity that is positive, negative or both).

For example, AbuJbara et al (2013) and Jochim and Schutze (2012) find the list of polar words from Wilson et al (2005) to be useful, and neither study lists dependency relations as significant features. $$$$$ Please see (Wiebe et al, 2005) for more details on the existing annotations in the MPQA Corpus.etc. A general covering term for such states is private state (Quirk et al, 1985).

Some lexicons assign real number scores to indicate sentiment orientations and strengths (i.e. probabilities of having positive and negative sentiments) (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) while other lexicons assign discrete classes (weak/strong, positive/negative) (Wilson et al, 2005). $$$$$ In these lexicons, entries are tagged with their a priori prior polarity

Further, there are analyses (Wiebe et al, 2005) and experiments (Wilson et al, 2005) that indicate that lexicon-lookup approaches to subjectivity analysis will have limited success on general texts. $$$$$ Please see (Wiebe et al, 2005) for more details on the existing annotations in the MPQA Corpus.etc. A general covering term for such states is private state (Quirk et al, 1985).

More specifically, we use the terms in the lexicon constructed from (Wilson et al, 2005) as the indicators to identify the substructures for the convolution kernels, and extract different sub-structures according to these indicators for various types of parse trees (Section 3). $$$$$ We define the gold standard used to train and test the system in terms of the manual annotations described in Section 2.

To solve this problem, we define the indicators in this task as subjective words in a polarity lexicon (Wilson et al, 2005). $$$$$ Words that are subjective in most contexts were marked strongly subjective (strongsubj), and those that may only have certain subjective usages were marked weakly subjective (weaksubj).
