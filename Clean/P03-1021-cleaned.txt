 $$$$$ In this paper, we use the following methods: multi-reference word error rate (mWER): When this method is used, the hypothesis translation is compared to various reference translations by computing the edit distance (minimum number of substitutions, insertions, deletions) between the hypothesis and the closest of the given reference translations. multi-reference position independent error rate (mPER): This criterion ignores the word order by treating a sentence as a bag-of-words and computing the minimum number of substitutions, insertions, deletions needed to transform the hypothesis into the closest of the given reference translations.
