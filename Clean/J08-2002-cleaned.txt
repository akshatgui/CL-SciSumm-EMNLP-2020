We also compare with the multi parse system of (Toutanova et al, 2008) which uses a global joint model using multiple parse trees. $$$$$ We evaluate the gains from incorporating this joint information on the Propbank corpus, when using correct syntactic parse trees as input, and when using automatically derived parse trees.
We also compare with the multi parse system of (Toutanova et al, 2008) which uses a global joint model using multiple parse trees. $$$$$ Promising approaches have been to consider multiple syntactic analyses—the top k parses from a single or multiple full parsers (Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005), or a shallow parse and a full parse (M`arquez et al. 2005; Pradhan et al.

In (Toutanova et al, 2008) a SRL model over Propbank that effectively exploits the semantic argument frame as a joint structure, is presented. $$$$$ We present a model for semantic role labeling that effectively captures the linguistic intuition that a semantic argument frame is a joint structure, with strong dependencies among the arguments.

Supervised SRL systems have mostly used local classifiers that assign a role to each constituent independently of others, and only modeled limited correlations among roles in a sequence (Toutanova et al., 2008). $$$$$ Most of this work relies heavily on local classifiers: ones that decide the semantic role of each phrase independently of the roles of other phrases.
