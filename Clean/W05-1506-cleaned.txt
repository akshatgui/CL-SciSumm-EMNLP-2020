Those weighted tree languages are recognizable and there exist algorithms (Huang and Chiang, 2005) that efficiently extract the k-best parse trees (i.e., those with the highest probability) for further processing. $$$$$ For ex ample, the distribution of parse trees for a given sentence under a PCFG can be represented as a packed forest from which the highest-probability tree can be easily extracted.However, when the objective function f has no com patible packed representation, exact inference would beintractable.
