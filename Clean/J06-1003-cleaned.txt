In addition, those methods that are based on hierarchical, taxonomically structured resources are generally better suited for measuring semantic similarity than relatedness (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). $$$$$ In addition, we explain why distributional similarity is not an adequate proxy for lexical semantic relatedness.

The semantic distance can be got by the usage of lexicon, such as WordNet (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). $$$$$ 17 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 Hirst and St-Onge (1998; St-Onge 1995) adapted Morris and Hirst?s (1991) seman- tic distance algorithm from Roget?s Thesaurus to WordNet.3 They distinguished two strengths of semantic relations in WordNet.

Semantic relatedness can denote every possible relation between two concepts, unlike semantic similarity, which typically denotes only certain hierarchical relations (like hypernymy and synonymy) and is often computed using hierarchical networks like WordNet (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). $$$$$ 16 Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatedness and its inverse, hypernymy; six meronymic (PART-OF) relations ?

We also experiment with the Jiang and Conrath's (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) measure which relies only on the is-a hierarchy, but proved to be the best WordNet-based measure in the task of ranking words (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006). $$$$$ From left to right and top to bottom

Following Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), we estimate the WordNet sense similarity using the method proposed by Jiang and Conrath (1997). $$$$$ An information-content?based measure proposed by Jiang and Conrath is found superior to those proposed by Hirst and St-Onge, Leacock and Chodorow, Lin, and Resnik.
Following Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), we estimate the WordNet sense similarity using the method proposed by Jiang and Conrath (1997). $$$$$ Reacting to the disadvantages of Resnik?s method, Jiang and Conrath?s (1997) idea was to synthesize edge- and node- based techniques by restoring network edges to their dominant role in similarity com- putations, and using corpus statistics as a secondary, corrective factor.

For example, Lin (1998b) finds similar phrases like captive-westerner which made sense only in the context of the corpus used, and Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) highlight other problems that stem from the imbalance and sparseness of the corpora. $$$$$ 6 In their original experiments, Lin and Jiang and Conrath used SemCor, a sense-tagged subset of the Brown Corpus, as their empirical data; but we decided to follow Resnik in using the full and untagged corpus.
For example, Lin (1998b) finds similar phrases like captive-westerner which made sense only in the context of the corpus used, and Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) highlight other problems that stem from the imbalance and sparseness of the corpora. $$$$$ These discrepancies can be explained by possible minor differences in implementation (e.g., the compound-word recognition mechanism used in collecting the frequency data), differences between the versions of WordNet used in the experiments (Resnik), and differences in the corpora used to obtain the frequency data (Jiang and Conrath, Lin).

In the experiments by Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), the measure by (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) yields the best results. $$$$$ From left to right and top to bottom
