We will concentrate on a detailed description of these annotations as they are a crucial component of our method and they are the major difference between the current proposal and the one described in Kay (1996). $$$$$ Arguments have been made in favor of a head-driven strategy which would, however, have been marginally more (e.g. in Kay (1989), Shieber, el. and the differences are, in any case, not germane to our current concerns.

(Wang, 1980) uses handwritten rules to generate sentences from an extended predicate logic formalism; (Shieber et al., 1990) introduces a head-driven algorithm for generating from logical forms; (Kay, 1996) defines a chart based algorithm which enhances efficiency by minimising the number of semantically incomplete phrases being built; and (Shemtov, 1996) presents an extension of the chart based generation algorithm presented in (Kay, 1996) which supports the generation of multiple paraphrases from underspecified semantic input. $$$$$ Chart Generation

Kay (1996) identified parsing charts as such an architecture, which led to the development of various chart generation algorithms $$$$$ 1 Charts Shieber (1988) showed that parsing charts can be also used in generation and raised the question, which we take up again here, of whether they constitute a natural uniform architecture for parsing and generation.

By analogy with parsing charts, an inactive edge labeled B(b ...) can be of as from means simply it is efficiently accessible through the index active ...) be thought of as incident from, or through, the index key property of this scheme is that active and inactive edges interact by virtue of indices that they share and, by letting vertices correspond to indices, we collect together sets of edges that could interact.
