Kay (1996) provides a more general view of the chart structure which is designed to provide for generation advantages comparable to those it provides for parsing. $$$$$ In particular, we will be interested in the extent to which they bring to the generation process advantages comparable to those that make them attractive in parsing.

We will concentrate on a detailed description of these annotations as they are a crucial component of our method and they are the major difference between the current proposal and the one described in Kay (1996). $$$$$ Arguments have been made in favor of a head-driven strategy which would, however, have been marginally more (e.g. in Kay (1989), Shieber, el. and the differences are, in any case, not germane to our current concerns.

Kay (1996) identified parsing charts as such an architecture, which led to the development of various chart generation algorithms: Carroll et al (1999) for HPSG, Bangalore et al (2000) for LTAG, Moore (2002) for unification grammars, White and Baldridge (2003) for CCG. $$$$$ 1 Charts Shieber (1988) showed that parsing charts can be also used in generation and raised the question, which we take up again here, of whether they constitute a natural uniform architecture for parsing and generation.

Following Stone and Doran (1997) and Kay (1996), we enhance this TAG grammar with a syntax-semantics interface in which nonterminal nodes of the elementary trees are equipped with index variables, which can be bound to individuals in the semantic input. $$$$$ The variables in the 'Cat' and 'Semantics' columns of (2) provide the essential link between syntax and semantics.

For instance, (Kay, 1996) proposes to reduce the number of constituents built during realisation by only considering for combination constituents with non overlapping semantics and compatible indices. $$$$$ The predicates that represent the semantics of a phrase will simply be the union of those representing the constituents.

The standard solution to this problem (cf.

By analogy with parsing charts, an inactive edge labeled B(b ...) can be of as from means simply it is efficiently accessible through the index active ...) be thought of as incident from, or through, the index key property of this scheme is that active and inactive edges interact by virtue of indices that they share and, by letting vertices correspond to indices, we collect together sets of edges that could interact.
