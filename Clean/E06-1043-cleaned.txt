Some of them are Frequency, Point-wise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989), Distributed frequency of object (Tapanainen et al, 1998), Distributed frequency of object using verb information (Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005), Similarity of object in verb object pair using the LSA model (Baldwin et al, 2003), (Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005) and Lexical and Syntactic fixedness (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006). $$$$$ We calculate the association strength for the target pair, and for each of its variants, , using pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church et al., 1991)

Another work uses both the syntactic and the lexical fixedness of VNICs in order to distinguish them from non-idiomatic ones, and eventually to extract them from corpora (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006). $$$$$ We demonstrate that these measures can be successfully applied to the task of automatically distinguishing idiomatic combinations from non-idiomatic ones.

To measure fixedness, we use statistical measures of lexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness that we have developed in a previous study (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006), as well as some new measures we introduce here. $$$$$ We thus propose a new measure of idiomaticity to be a measure of the overall fixedness of a given pair.

The small amount of previous work on the identification of syntactic fixedness (Wermter and Hahn (2004), Fazly and Stevenson (2006)) has either focused on a single variation variety, or has only been evaluated for combinations of a small preselected list of words, presumably due to noise. $$$$$ Table 4 presents the performance of the hybrid measure, , repeating that of and for comparison. outperforms both lexical and syntactic fixedness measures, with a substantial improvement over , and a small, but notable, improvement over .

Fazly and Stevenson (2006) propose a measure for detecting the syntactic fixedness of English verb phrases of the same variety as us. $$$$$ We propose a measure that compares the “syntactic behaviour” of the target pair with that of a “typical” verb–noun pair.

Fazly and Stevenson (2006) combine information about syntactic and lexical fixedness (i.e., estimated degree of compositionality) into one measure. $$$$$ The posterior probability of an individual pattern is estimated as

In particular, Fazly and Stevenson (2006) look at the correlation between syntactic fixedness (in terms of e.g. passivisation, choice of determiner type and pluralisation) and non-compositionality of verb-noun compounds such as shoot the breeze. $$$$$ For example, the meaning of shoot the breeze, a highly idiomatic expression, has nothing to do with either shoot or breeze.

In their work on automatically identifying idiom types, Fazly and Stevenson (2006) - henceforth FS06 - show that an idiomatic VNC tends to have one (or at most a small number of) canonical form (s), which are its most preferred syntactic patterns. $$$$$ Merging the three variation types results in a pattern set, , of distinct syntactic patterns, given in Table 1.2 The second step is to devise a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of syntactic fixedness of a verb–noun pair, with respect to the selected set of patterns, .

In a previous study (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006), the authors came up with a dozen possible syntactic forms for verb-object pairs (based on passivization, determiner, and object pluralization) and used a corpus based statistical measure to determine the canonical form (s). $$$$$ Interestingly, although it is a PMI-based measure, performs slightly better when the data is separated based on frequency.

Fazly and Stevenson (2006) use statistical measures of syntactic behaviour to gauge whether a verb and noun combination is likely to be a idiom. $$$$$ We thus propose to use the degree of lexical and syntactic flexibility of a given verb+noun combination to determine the level of idiomaticity of the expression.
Fazly and Stevenson (2006) use statistical measures of syntactic behaviour to gauge whether a verb and noun combination is likely to be a idiom. $$$$$ Here we describe our measures for idiomaticity, which quantify the degree of lexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness of a given verb+noun combination, represented as a verb–noun pair.

Certainly it would be worth combining the preferences with other measures, such as syntactic fixedness (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006). $$$$$ Each of the lexical and syntactic fixedness measures is a good indicator of idiomaticity on its own, with syntactic fixedness being a better predictor.

Nonetheless, the mentioned characteristics are useful indicators to distinguish literal and idiomatic expressions (Fazly and Stevenson, 2006). $$$$$ Nonetheless, it has proven useful in many NLP applications (Resnik, 1999; Dagan et al., 1994).

Fazly and Stevenson (2006) use lexical and syntactic fixedness as partial indicators of noncompositionality. $$$$$ Nevertheless, lexical and syntactic flexibility may well be used as partial indicators of semantic analyzability, and hence idiomaticity.

Similar to Lin (1999), McCarthy et al (2003) and Fazly and Stevenson (2006), our method makes use of automatically generated thesauri; the technique used to compile the thesauri differs from previous work. $$$$$ We use the automatically-built thesaurus of Lin (1998) to find similar words to the noun of the target expression, in order to automatically generate variants.

Combining our semantics-based approach with other extraction techniques such as the syntactic fixedness measure proposed by Fazly and Stevenson (2006) might improve the results significantly. $$$$$ Based on the development results, the best value for is (giving more weight to the syntactic fixedness measure).
