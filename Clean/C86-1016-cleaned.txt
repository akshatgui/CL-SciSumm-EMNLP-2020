Instead, it takes care of fillers and gaps through a threading& quot; technique (Karttunen 1986:77). $$$$$ By deact ivat ing this facility, the grammar writer can also take care of fi l lers and gaps in a manner  of his own choosing.

Consider the following rules taken from D-PATR (Karttunen, 1986). $$$$$ We consider two cases here.
