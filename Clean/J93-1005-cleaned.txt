As the result, we conclude that if we do not resolve PP attachment problem (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), to the expected extent, we will not extract he maximal noun phrases. $$$$$ Of the object noun phrases identified, 223,666 were ambiguous verb— noun—preposition triples.
As the result, we conclude that if we do not resolve PP attachment problem (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), to the expected extent, we will not extract he maximal noun phrases. $$$$$ However, we expect that the method will be extendable to other instances of PP attachment ambiguity, such as the ambiguity that arises when several prepositional phrases follow a subject NP, and to ambiguities involving other phrases, especially phrases such as infinitives that have syntactic markers analogous to a preposition.

PP-attachment is known to depend on the object of the preposition (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ Our object is to develop a procedure to guess whether a preposition is attached to the verb or its object when a verb and its object are followed by a preposition.

For prepositions, we consider only cases in which the parent is a noun or a verb and the child is a noun (this corresponds to the cases considered by Hindleand Rooth (1993) and others). $$$$$ In some cases it is fairly certain whether the preposition attaches to the noun or the verb; in other cases, this is far less certain.
For prepositions, we consider only cases in which the parent is a noun or a verb and the child is a noun (this corresponds to the cases considered by Hindleand Rooth (1993) and others). $$$$$ In 241 of those cases, there is information only on noun or only on verb association.

We therefore analyze the errors made on the development set to determine whether the difficult remaining cases for parsers correspond to the Hindle and Rooth (1993) style PP attachment classification task. $$$$$ Disambiguating the test sample turned out to be a surprisingly difficult task.

Hindle and Rooth (1993) were the first to show that a corpus-based approach to PP attachment ambiguity resolution can lead to good results. $$$$$ There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains.

After the initial effort by Hindle and Rooth (1993), it has become clear that this area needs statistical methods in which an easy integration of many information sources is possible. $$$$$ Unfortunately, it is not clear where the necessary information about lexical preferences is to be found.

One of the earliest corpus-based approaches to prepositional phrase attachment used lexical preference by computing co-occurrence frequencies (lexical associations) of verbs and nouns with prepositions (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ Our proposal is to use co-occurrence of verbs and nouns with prepositions in a large body of text as an indicator of lexical preference.
One of the earliest corpus-based approaches to prepositional phrase attachment used lexical preference by computing co-occurrence frequencies (lexical associations) of verbs and nouns with prepositions (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ The table of verbs, nouns, and prepositions is in several respects an imperfect source of information about lexical associations.

 $$$$$ Second, a preposition in an entry might be structurally related to neither the noun of the entry nor the verb (if there is one), even if the entry is derived from a correct parse.
 $$$$$ We thank Bill Gale, Ken Church, and David Yarowsky for many helpful discussions of this work and are grateful to four reviewers and Christian Rohrer for their comments on an earlier version.

There are multiple approaches ranging from purely statistical (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), to hybrid approaches that take into account the lexical semantics of the verb (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ We began this paper by alluding to several approaches to PP attachment, specifically work assuming the construction of discourse models, approaches based on structural attachment preferences, and work indicating a dominant role for lexical preference.

Li and Abe (1998) use a minimum description length-based algorithm to find an optimal tree cut over WordNet for each classification problem, finding improvements over both lexical association (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) and conceptual association, and equaling the transformation-based results. $$$$$ This is evidence of a lexical association of the verb send with to.

Examples of this work include a system by Liu et al (1990), and experiments by Hindle and Rooth (1993), and Resnik and Hearst (1993). $$$$$ Other approaches to adjusting small frequencies are discussed in Church et al. (1991) and Gale, Church, Yarowsky (in press).

It is also the case that we thought PP attachment might be improved because of the increased coverage of preposition noun and preposition-verb combinations that work such as (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) show to be so important. $$$$$ Finally, entries of the form verb noun preposition do not tell us whether to induce a lexical association between verb and preposition or between noun and preposition.

In computational linguistics, a multitude of tasks is sensitive to selectional preferences, such as the resolution of ambiguous attachments (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ For instance, N precision is the fraction of cases that the procedure identified as N attachments that actually were N attachments.
In computational linguistics, a multitude of tasks is sensitive to selectional preferences, such as the resolution of ambiguous attachments (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ The LA procedure recognized about 85% of the 586 actual noun attachment examples as noun attachments, and about 70% of the actual verb attachments as verb attachments.

Hindle and Rooth (1993) used a partial parser to extract (v, n, p) tuples from a corpus, where p is the preposition whose attachment is ambiguous between the verb v and the noun n. $$$$$ For each noun phrase head, we recorded the following preposition if any occurred (ignoring whether or not the parser had attached the preposition to the noun phrase), and the preceding verb if the noun phrase was the object of that verb.

Training on unambiguous cases is similar in spirit to (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ The precision figure is similar to that obtained by the lexical association procedure with a threshold of zero, but the recall is far lower: the dictionary provides insufficient information in most cases.

Web frequencies were reliable enough and did not need smoothing for (i), but for (ii), smoothing using the technique described in Hindle and Rooth (1993) led to better recall. $$$$$ The maximum likelihood estimate described above is not very good when frequencies are small, and when frequencies are zero, the formula will not work at all.

Pattern (5) is motivated by the observation that if n1 is a pronoun, this suggests a verb attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ This suggests that a distributional approach can provide an approximate solution to parsing problems that, in the worst case, call for complex reasoning.
Pattern (5) is motivated by the observation that if n1 is a pronoun, this suggests a verb attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993). $$$$$ For example, if the LA score is 2.0, then the probability of verb attachment is four times greater than noun attachment.

The standard method of solving the PP-attachment problem is based on collocation extraction (cf., e.g., (Hindle and Rooth, 1993)). $$$$$ We also wanted a standard of correctness for the test sentences.
