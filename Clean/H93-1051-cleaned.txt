Some clusters of studies have used common test suites, most notably the 2094-word line data of Leacock et al (1993), shared by Lehman (1994) and Mooney (1996) and evaluated on the system of Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992). $$$$$ In these experiments, two-sentence contexts are used in place of a fixed-sized window of ?50 tokens surrounding the tar- get word that Gale, et.

For this preliminary experiment, we used the "line" dataset of a word sense disambiguation task (Leacock et al, 1993). $$$$$ In this experiment, we used linguistic units - sentences - instead.
For this preliminary experiment, we used the "line" dataset of a word sense disambiguation task (Leacock et al, 1993). $$$$$ In the six- sense disambiguation task, the X 2 results indicate that the Bayesian and neural network classifiers response patterns are not significantly different for any sense.

Further details can be found in the Leacock et al (1993). $$$$$ A three-sense distinction task was then run, which is re- ported in Voorhees, st. al.

Others have used common test suites such as the 2094-word line data of Leacock et al (1993). $$$$$ The sense resolution task used the following six senses of the noun line: 1. a product: a  new line of workstations 2. a formation of people or things: stand in line 3. spoken or written tezt: a  line from Shakespeare 4. a thin, flexible object; cord: a nylon line 5. an abstract division: a line between good and evil 6. a telephone connection: the line went dead The classifiers were run three times each on randomly selected training sets.

In particular, we use subsets of the line data (Leacock et al, 1993) and the English lexical sample data from the SENSEVAL-2 comparative exercise among word sense disambiguation systems (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001). $$$$$ Associated with each to- ken is a set of saliences, one for each sense, calculated from the training data.
