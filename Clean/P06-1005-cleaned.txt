 $$$$$ Paths connecting pronouns to pronouns are different than paths connecting both nouns and pronouns to pronouns – the case we are ultimately interested in resolving.
 $$$$$ Preliminary experiments show path coreference bootstrapping can also provide a means of identifying pleonastic pronouns, where pleonastic neutral pronouns are often followed in a dependency path by a terminal noun of different gender, and cataphoric constructions, where the pronouns are often followed by nouns of matching gender.

We follow the closed track setting where systems may only be trained on the provided training data, with the exception of the English gender and number data compiled by Bergsma and Lin (2006). $$$$$ We acquire gender and number data for over 3 million nouns.
We follow the closed track setting where systems may only be trained on the provided training data, with the exception of the English gender and number data compiled by Bergsma and Lin (2006). $$$$$ We are pleased to be able to share our gender and number data with the NLP community.2 In Section 6, we show the benefit of this data as a probabilistic feature in our pronoun resolution system.

Bergsma and Lin (2006) determine the likelihood of coreference along the syntactic path connecting a pronoun to a possible antecedent, by looking at the distribution of the path in text. $$$$$ Our algorithm determines that the dependency path linking the Noun and pronoun is very likely to connect coreferent entities for the path “Noun needs pronoun’s friend,” while it is rarely coreferent for the path “Noun needs pronoun’s support.” This likelihood can be learned by simply counting how often we see a given path in text with an initial Noun and a final pronoun that are from the same/different gender/number classes.
Bergsma and Lin (2006) determine the likelihood of coreference along the syntactic path connecting a pronoun to a possible antecedent, by looking at the distribution of the path in text. $$$$$ Due to the hard filters and limited search window, it is not possible for our system to resolve every noun to a correct antecedent.

Given an automatically parsed corpus, Bergsma and Lin (2006) extract from each parse tree a dependency path, which is represented as a sequence of nodes and dependency labels connecting a pronoun and a candidate antecedent, and collect statistical information from these paths to determine the likelihood that a pronoun and a candidate antecedent connected by a given path are coreferent. $$$$$ A dependency path is defined as the sequence of dependency links between two potentially coreferent entities in a parse tree.

Gender and Animacy processor: This modules collects gender information from the gender corpus (Bergsma and Lin, 2006) and checks a self-made corpus for profession (teacher, doctor, etc) and family relations (mother, father, etc), extracted from web searches. $$$$$ Thus we attempted to duplicate Bergsma’s corpus-based extraction of gender and number, where the information can be stored in advance in a table, but using a much larger data set.

In the closed track, systems were limited to the provided data, plus the use of two pre-specified external resources: i) WordNet and ii) a pre-computed number and gender table by Bergsma and Lin (2006). $$$$$ Thus we attempted to duplicate Bergsma’s corpus-based extraction of gender and number, where the information can be stored in advance in a table, but using a much larger data set.

We assign number attributes based on: (a) a static list for pronouns; (b) NER labels: mentions marked as a named entity are considered singular with the exception of organizations, which can be both singular or plural; (c) part of speech tags: NN*S tags are plural and all other NN* tags are singular; and (d) a static dictionary from (Bergsma and Lin, 2006). $$$$$ We partition pronouns into seven groups of matching gender, number, and person; for example, the first person singular group contains I, me, my, mine, and myself.

All the knowledge required by the feature functions is obtained from the annotations of the corpora and no external resources have been used with the exception of WordNet (Miller, 1995), gender and number information (Bergsma and Lin, 2006) and sense inventories. $$$$$ They lack the specific world knowledge required in the second instance – the knowledge that a person does not usually explicitly need his own support.

Both Ge et al (1998) and Bergsma and Lin (2006) show that learned gender is the most important feature in their pronoun resolution systems. $$$$$ Since no such corpus exists, researchers have used coarser features learned from smaller sets through supervised learning (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002), manually-defined coreference patterns to mine specific kinds of data (Bean and Riloff, 2004; Bergsma, 2005), or accepted the noise inherent in unsupervised schemes (Ge et al., 1998; Cherry and Bergsma, 2005).

We use the approach of Bergsma and Lin (2006), both because it achieves state-of-the-art gender classification performance, and because a database of the obtained noun genders is available online. $$$$$ We now evaluate the utility of path coreference within a state-of-the-art machine-learned resolution system for third-person pronouns with nominal antecedents.
We use the approach of Bergsma and Lin (2006), both because it achieves state-of-the-art gender classification performance, and because a database of the obtained noun genders is available online. $$$$$ Ideally we would assess the benefit of our probabilistic features using the same state-of-the-art preprocessing modules employed by others such as (Yang et al., 2005) (who additionally use a search engine for compatibility scoring).

We can regard the Bergsma and Lin (2006) approach and our discriminative system as two orthogonal views of gender, in a co-training sense (Blum and Mitchell, 1998). $$$$$ This result led us to re-examine the high performance of Bergsma’s web-based approach.

For English, number and gender for common nouns are computed via a comparison of head lemma to head and using the number and gender data of Bergsma and Lin (2006). $$$$$ We then use this gender/number information to count paths where an initial noun (with probabilisticallyassigned gender/number) and following pronoun are connected by the dependency path, recording the agreement or disagreement of their gender/number category.'
