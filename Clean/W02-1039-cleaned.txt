The second constraint, known as the cohesion constraint (Fox, 2002), uses the dependency tree (Melcuk, 1987) of the English sentence to restrict possible link combinations. $$$$$ The alignments are of two types: sure (S) and possible (P).

Fox (2002) shows that translation between English and French satisfies cohesion in the majority cases. $$$$$ Figure 1 shows an example of an English parse along with the alignment between the English and French words (shown with dotted lines).
Fox (2002) shows that translation between English and French satisfies cohesion in the majority cases. $$$$$ We have examined the issue of phrasal cohesion between English and French and discovered that while there is less cohesion than we might desire, there is still a large amount of regularity in the constructions where breakdowns occur.

Similar alternations are rife in bilingual data, e.g., ne pas in French (Fox, 2002) and separable prefixes in German (Collins et al 2005). $$$$$ The English word “not” is aligned to the two French words “ne” and “pas” and thus has a span of [1,3].
Similar alternations are rife in bilingual data, e.g., ne pas in French (Fox, 2002) and separable prefixes in German (Collins et al 2005). $$$$$ Because “ne ... pas” wraps around the verb, it will always result in a crossing.

In addition to lexical translation, our system models structural changes and changes to feature values, for although dependency structures are fairly well preserved across languages (Fox, 2002), there are certainly many instances where the structure must be modified. $$$$$ In addition, the crossings associated with these particular structures were unambiguously caused by negation (i.e. for each structure, only negation-related crossings were present).
In addition to lexical translation, our system models structural changes and changes to feature values, for although dependency structures are fairly well preserved across languages (Fox, 2002), there are certainly many instances where the structure must be modified. $$$$$ Therefore, dependency structures should cohere as well as, or better than, their corresponding syntactic structures.

For this, we need a formalism that is expressive enough to deal with cases of syntactic divergence between source and target languages (Fox, 2002): for any given (pi, f, a) triple, it is useful to produce a derivation that minimally explains the transformation be tween pi and f, while remaining consistent with a. $$$$$ The translation model captures the translation of source language words into the target language and the reordering of those words.

Fox (2002) measured phrasal cohesion in gold standard alignments by counting crossings. $$$$$ Recalling the two different types of alignments, S and P, we examined three different conditions: S alignments only, P alignments only, or S alignments where present falling back to P alignments (S P).
Fox (2002) measured phrasal cohesion in gold standard alignments by counting crossings. $$$$$ Also as before, half to two-thirds of crossings in the S P and P alignments are due to phrasal translations.

However, as Fox (2002) showed, even in a language pair as close as French-English, there are situations where phrasal cohesion should not be maintained. $$$$$ For this reason, we have examined phrasal cohesion for French and English, two languages which are fairly close syntactically but have enough differences to be interesting.
However, as Fox (2002) showed, even in a language pair as close as French-English, there are situations where phrasal cohesion should not be maintained. $$$$$ For example, in Figure 2 note that every pair of English and French words under the verb phrase is aligned.

Fox (2002) showed that many common reorderings fall outside the scope of synchronous grammars that only allow the reordering of child nodes. $$$$$ Among the cases which do result from language differences, the most common is the “ne ... pas” construction (e.g.
Fox (2002) showed that many common reorderings fall outside the scope of synchronous grammars that only allow the reordering of child nodes. $$$$$ Next most common is the case where the English contains a modal verb which is aligned with the main verb in the French.

Compare the systematic study for English-French alignments by (Fox, 2002), who compared (i) tree-bank parser style analyses, (ii) a variant with flattened VPs, and (iii) dependency structures. $$$$$ We also compare three variant syntactic representations to determine which one has the best properties with respect to cohesion.

In real corpora, cases such as node N2 are frequent enough to be noticeable (see Fox (2002) or section 4.1 in this paper). $$$$$ Both types of crossings are much more frequent (4.790 for heads and 0.88 for modifiers) and Then, for a given phrase with head constituent if and are part of a phrasal translation in alignment otherwise phrasal translation filtering has a much larger effect (reducing head average to 2.772 and modifier average to 0.516).

Similar to the Pharoah package (Koehn, 2004), we extract phrase-pairs directly from word alignment together with coherence constraints (Fox, 2002) to remove noisy ones. $$$$$ Other than this, there is little in the SMT literature to validate the coherence assumption.

One of assumptions of phrase-based SMT is that phrase cohere across two languages (Fox, 2002), which means phrases in one language tend to be moved together during translation. $$$$$ These have taken several different forms, but all share the basic assumption that phrases in one language tend to stay together (i.e. cohere) during translation and thus the word-reordering operation can move entire phrases, rather than moving each word independently.

(Fox, 2002) is characterized by its simplicity, which has attracted researchers for years. $$$$$ The “Head Crossings” line shows the results when comparing the span of the head constituent of a phrase with the spans of its modifier constituents, and “Modifier Crossings” refers to the case where we compare the spans of pairs of modifiers.

Dependencies were found to be more consistent than constituent structure between French and English by Fox (2002), though this study used a tree representation on the English side only. $$$$$ In the example in Figure 6, “will be” is aligned to “sera” (indicated by the solid lines) and because of the constituent structure of the English parse there is a crossing.

This confirms the results of Fox (2002) and Galley et al (2004) that many translation operations must span more than one parse tree node. $$$$$ Several studies have reported alignment or translation performance for syntactically augmented translation models (Wu, 1997; Wang, 1998; Alshawi et al., 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Jones and Havrilla, 1998) and these results have been promising.

The advantages of modeling how a target language syntax tree moves with respect to a source language syntax tree are that (i) we can capture the fact that constituents move as a whole and generally respect the phrasal cohesion constraints (Fox, 2002), and (ii) we can model broad syntactic reordering phenomena, such as subject-verb-object constructions translating into subject-object-verb ones, as is generally the case for English and Japanese. $$$$$ The translation model captures the translation of source language words into the target language and the reordering of those words.

In a very interesting study of syntax in statistical machine translation, Fox (2002) looks at how well proposed translation models fit actual translation data. $$$$$ There has been much interest in using phrasal movement to improve statistical machine translation.

Previous to Fox (2002), it had been observed that this model would prohibit certainre-orderings in certain language pairs (such as subject VP (verb-object) into verb-subject-object), but Fox carried out the first careful empirical study, showing that many other common translation patterns fall outside the scope of the child-reordering model. $$$$$ The translation model captures the translation of source language words into the target language and the reordering of those words.
