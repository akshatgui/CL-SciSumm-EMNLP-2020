Dual decomposition is a generic method that has been proposed for handling decoding (i.e. optimization) with such models, by decoupling the problem into two alternating steps that can each be handled by dynamic programming or other polynomial-time algorithms (Rush et al 2010), an approach that has been applied to Statistical Ma chine Translation (phrase-based (Chang and Collins, 1133 2011) and hierarchical (Rush and Collins, 2011)) among others. $$$$$ However, these methods, although polynomial time, are substantially less efficient than our algorithms, and are considerably more complex to implement.
