Medlock and Briscoe (2007) proposed a weakly supervised setting for hedge classification in scientific texts where the aim is to minimise human supervision needed to obtain an adequate amount of training data. $$$$$ In many cases hedge classification is challenging even for a human annotator.

The authors are only aware of the following related corpora $$$$$ We show that hedge classification is feasible using weakly supervised ML, and point toward avenues for future research.
The authors are only aware of the following related corpora $$$$$ We annotated six of the papers to form a test set with a total of 380 spec sentences and 1157 nspec sentences, and randomly selected 300,000 sentences from the remaining papers as training data for the weakly supervised learner.

5 articles from FlyBase (the same data were used by Medlock and Briscoe (2007) for evaluating sentence-level hedge classifiers) and 4 articles from the open access BMC Bioinformatics website were downloaded and annotated for negations, uncertainty and their scopes. $$$$$ Relative F1 (Frel 1 ) and Cohen’s Kappa (n) were then used to quantify the level of agreement.

Szarvas (2008) extended the weakly supervised machine learning methodology of Medlock and Briscoe (2007) by applying feature selection to reduce the number of candidate keywords, by using limited manual supervision to filter the features, and by extending the feature representation with bigrams and trigrams. $$$$$ We investigate automatic classification of speculative language (‘hedging’), in biomedical text using weakly supervised machine learning.

Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) did experiments on the same dataset as Medlock and Briscoe (2007) and their experimental results proved that the classification accuracy can be improved by approximately 9% (from an F-score of 76% to an F-score of 85%) if syntactic and semantic information are incorporated. $$$$$ The baseline classifier achieves a BEP of 0.60 while both classifiers using our learning model reach approximately 0.76 BEP with little to tell between them.

The experiments run by Medlock (2008) on the same dataset as Medlock and Briscoe (2007) show that adding features based on part-of speech tags to a bag-of-words input representation can slightly improve the accuracy, but the improvements are marginal and not statistically significant. $$$$$ In this study we use single terms as features, based on the intuition that many hedge cues are single terms (suggest, likely etc.) and due to the success of ‘bag of words’ representations in many classification tasks to date.

We can then use the large amounts of unannotated sentences that are available to extract n-gram features that have high uncertainty class conditional probability and add them to our training set with those features labeled as hedges as described in Medlock and Briscoe (2007). $$$$$ Firstly, due to the relative sparsity of hedge cues, most samples contain large numbers of irrelevant features.
