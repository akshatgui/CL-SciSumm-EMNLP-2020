As initiative passes back and forth between discourse participants, control over the conversation similarly transfers from one speaker to another (Walker and Whittaker, 1990). $$$$$ As INITIATIVE passes back and forth between the discourse participants, we say that CONTROL over the conversation gets trans- ferred from one discourse participant to another.

After experimenting with several tagging methods, we concluded that the approach presented in Walker and Whittaker (1990) adopted from (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) best captured the aspects of the dialogue we were interested in and, as with the DAs, could be tagged reliably on our data. $$$$$ The differences in the beliefs and knowledge states of the participants can be interpreted in the terms of the collaborative planning principles of Whittaker and Stenton[WS88].

Before embarking on an exhaustive manual annotation of initiative, I chose to get a sense of whether initiative may indeed affect learning in this context by automatically tagging for initiative using an approximation of Walker and Whittaker's utterance based allocation of control rules (Walker and Whittaker, 1990). $$$$$ We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classification and a set of rules for transfer of control between discourse participants that were proposed by Whittaker and Stenton[WS88].

For dialogue initiative annotation, we used the well-known utterance-based rules for allocation of control from (Walker and Whittaker, 1990). $$$$$ The rules for the allocation of control are based on the utterance type classification and allow a di- alogue to be divided into segments that correspond to which speaker is the controller of the segment.

Once the dialogue acts had been automatically annotated, two coders, one of the authors and an out side annotator, coded 24 dialogues (1449 utterances, approximately 45% of the corpus) for dialogue initiative, by using the four control rules from (Walker and Whittaker, 1990). $$$$$ We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classification and a set of rules for transfer of control between discourse participants that were proposed by Whittaker and Stenton[WS88].
