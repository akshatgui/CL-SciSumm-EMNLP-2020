Following Petrov et al (2006) latent annotations and probabilities for the associated rules are learnt incrementally following an iterative process consisting of the repetition of three steps. $$$$$ For instance, Matsuzaki et al. (2005) start by annotating their grammar with the identity of the parent and sibling, which are observed (i.e. not latent), before adding latent annotations.4 If these manual annotations are good, they reduce the search space for EM by constraining it to a smaller region.

We demonstrate that likelihood-based hierarchical EM training (Petrov et al, 2006) and cluster-based language modeling methods (Goodman, 2001) are superior to both rank-based and random-projection methods. $$$$$ In this paper, we investigate the learning of a grammar consistent with a treebank at the level of evaluation symbols (such as NP, VP, etc.) but split based on the likelihood of the training trees.

For example in the domain of syntactic parsing with probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), a surprising recent result is that automatically induced grammar refinements can outperform sophisticated methods which exploit substantial manually articulated structure (Petrov et al, 2006). $$$$$ Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) underlie most high-performance parsers in one way or another (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
For example in the domain of syntactic parsing with probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), a surprising recent result is that automatically induced grammar refinements can outperform sophisticated methods which exploit substantial manually articulated structure (Petrov et al, 2006). $$$$$ Their exciting result was that, while grammars quickly grew too large to be managed, a 16-subsymbol induced grammar reached the parsing performance of Klein and Manning (2003)’s manual grammar.

In this paper, we consider a much more automatic, data-driven approach to learning HMM structure for acoustic modeling, analagous to the approach taken by Petrov et al (2006) for learning PCFGs. $$$$$ Recently, Matsuzaki et al. (2005) and also Prescher (2005) exhibited an automatic approach in which each symbol is split into a fixed number of subsymbols.

We have so far dealt with the adequacy of representation and we plan to test whether more sophisticated estimation (e.g., split-merge-smooth estimation as in (Petrov et al, 2006)) can obtain further improvements from the explicit representation of agreement. $$$$$ However, we use a more sophisticated split-and-merge approach that allocates subsymbols adaptively where they are most effective, like a linguist would.

We combine multiple word representations based on semantic clusters extracted from the (Brown et al, 1992) algorithm and syntactic clusters obtained from the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al, 2006) in order to improve discriminative dependency parsing in the MST Parser framework (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ Therefore, it would be to our advantage to split the latent annotations only where needed, rather than splitting them all as in Matsuzaki et al.

To generate parse trees, we use the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al, 2006), and use Collins head rules (Collins, 2003) to head-out binarize each tree. $$$$$ Other work has also investigated aspects of automatic grammar refinement; for example, Chiang and Bikel (2002) learn annotations such as head rules in a constrained declarative language for tree-adjoining grammars.
