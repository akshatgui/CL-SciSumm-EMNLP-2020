Others were derived from corpora, including subjective nouns learned from unannotated data using bootstrapping (Riloff et al, 2003). $$$$$ Subjective features learned from unannotated documents can augment or enhance features learned from annotated training data using more traditional supervised learning techniques.

Subjectivity classification of small units of text, such as individual micro blog posts (Jiang et al, 2011) and sentences (Riloff et al, 2003), has been shown to benefit from additional context. $$$$$ Research in genre classification may include recognition of subjective genres such as editorials (e.g., (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997; Wiebe et al., 2001)).

Riloff et al (2003) learned lists of subjective nouns in English, seeding their method with 20 high-frequency, strongly subjective words. $$$$$ So we searched for each of the 850 nouns in the bootstrapping corpus, sorted them by frequency, and manually selected 20 high-frequency words that we judged to be strongly subjective.

There are some Natural Language Processing (NLP) researches that demonstrate the benefit of hedge detection experimentally in several subjects, such as the ICD-9-CM coding of radiology reports and gene named Entity Extraction (Szarvas, 2008), question answering systems (Riloff et al, 2003), information extraction from biomedical texts (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007). $$$$$ Many natural language processing applications could benefit from being able to distinguish between factual and subjective information.

However, as demonstrated by Pang et al (2002), Pang and Lee (2004), Hu and Liu (2004), and Riloff et al (2003), there are some nouns and verbs that are useful sentiment indicators as well. $$$$$ Pang et al. (2002) reported that a similar experiment produced their best results on a related classification task.

To build our subjective spoken corpus (more than 2,000 texts), we used a parallel corpus of English Portuguese speeches and a tool to automatically classify sentences in English as objective or subjective (OpinionFinder (Riloff et al, 2003)). $$$$$ The annotated corpus used to train and test our subjectivity classifiers (the experiment corpus) consists of 109 documents with a total of 2197 sentences.

Extracting syntactic patterns contribute towards the affective orientation of a sentence (Riloff et al, 2003). $$$$$ If so, the sentence should be subjective.

Basilisk was originally designed for semantic class induction using lexico-syntactic patterns, but has also been used to learn subjective and objective nouns (Riloff et al, 2003). $$$$$ They represent lexico-syntactic expressions that typically rely on shallow parsing and syntactic role assignment.
