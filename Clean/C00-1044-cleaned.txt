Unlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000). $$$$$ Since orientation is inher- ently connected with cwduative judgements, it appears to be a promising feature for predicting subjectivity.
Unlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000). $$$$$ Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown applied their method to 1,336 (657 positive and 679 negative) adjectives which were all the oriented adjectives appearing in the corpus 20 times or more.

Words that encode a desirable state (e.g., beautiful) have a positive SO, while words that represent undesirable states (e.g. absurd) have a negative SO (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000). $$$$$ Words that encode a desirable state (e.g., beautiful, unbiased) have a positive orientation, while words that represent undesirable states have a negative orientation.

Based on (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) and (Turney, 2002), we consider four types of structures (as shown in Table 5) during sentiment phrase extraction. $$$$$ Be- cause the accuracy ol the method depends on the den- sity of conjunctions per adjective, Hatzivassiloglou and MeKeown tested separately their algorithm for adjectives appearing in at least 2, 3, 4, or 5 conjunctions in the co l pus; their results are shown in Table I.

In addition, the presence of semantically oriented (positive and negative) words in a sentence is an indicator that the sentence is subjective (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000). $$$$$ Words that encode a desirable state (e.g., beautiful, unbiased) have a positive orientation, while words that represent undesirable states have a negative orientation.
