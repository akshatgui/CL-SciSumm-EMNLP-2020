This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person's four-star review is another's two-star. $$$$$ As Table 1 shows, both subjects performed perfectly when the rating separation was at least 3 “notches” in the original scale (we define a notch as a half star in a four- or five-star scheme and 10 points in a 100-point scheme).

In order to compare our approach to other methods we also show results on commonly used sentiment datasets: movie reviews (MR) (Pang and Lee, 2005) and opinions5 (MPQA) (Wiebe et al, 2005). $$$$$ Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa (2004) used SVM regression to classify clause-level strength of opinion, reporting that it provided lower accuracy than other methods.

The optimal POS bi-tags have been derived experimentally by using top 10% features on information gain based-pruning classifier on polarity dataset by (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ In a sense, we are using explicit item and label similarity information to increasingly penalize the initial classifier as it assigns more divergent labels to similar items.

Cascaded models for sentiment classification were studied by (Pang and Lee, 2005). $$$$$ Interestingly, previous sentiment analysis research found that a minimum-cut formulation for the binary subjective/objective distinction yielded good results (Pang and Lee, 2004).

This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ Also, our task differs from ranking not only because one can be given a single item to classify (as opposed to a set of items to be ordered relative to one another), but because there are settings in which classification is harder than ranking, and vice versa.
This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ Indeed, some potential obstacles to accurate rating inference include lack of calibration (e.g., what an understated author intends as high praise may seem lukewarm), author inconsistency at assigning fine-grained ratings, and For data, we first collected Internet movie reviews in English from four authors, removing explicit rating indicators from each document’s text automatically.
