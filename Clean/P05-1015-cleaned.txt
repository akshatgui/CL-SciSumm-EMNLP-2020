This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person's four-star review is another's two-star. $$$$$ As Table 1 shows, both subjects performed perfectly when the rating separation was at least 3 “notches” in the original scale (we define a notch as a half star in a four- or five-star scheme and 10 points in a 100-point scheme).

This indicates there is some difficulty distinguishing between the fine-grained categories we specified, but high agreement at a coarser level, which advocates using a ranking approach for evaluation (see also Pang and Lee 2005). $$$$$ Also, our task differs from ranking not only because one can be given a single item to classify (as opposed to a set of items to be ordered relative to one another), but because there are settings in which classification is harder than ranking, and vice versa.
