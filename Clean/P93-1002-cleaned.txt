As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ These algorithms are not robust with respect to non-literal translations and small deletions; they can easily misalign small passages because they ignore word identities.
As shown in Chen (1993) and Wu (1994), however, sentence length based methods suffer when the texts to be aligned contain small passages, or the languages involved share few cognates. $$$$$ With length-based alignment algorithms, these passages may well be misaligned by an even number of sentences if one of the corpora contains a deletion.

Other translation-based alignments (Kay, 199l; Chen, 1993) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and are very complex. $$$$$ Our algorithm constructs a simple statistical word-to-word translation model on the fly during alignment.

As Chen (1993) points out, dynamic programming is particularly susceptible to deletions occurring in one of the two languages. $$$$$ Dynamic programming is also used to search for the best alignment.

Simard and Plamondon (Simard and Plamondon, 1998) used a composite method in which the first pass does alignment at the level of characters asin (Church, 1993) (itself based on cognate matching) and the second pass uses IBM Model-1, following Chen (Chen, 1993). $$$$$ We present its most significant characteristics in this section; for a more complete discussion please refer to (Chen, 1993).

(The problem of aligning parallel corpora at the sentence level has been addressed by Meyers (1998b) Chen (1993) and others and is beyond the scope of this paper). $$$$$ In this paper, we describe a fast algorithm for aligning sentences with their translations in a bilingual corpus.

By adopting the IBM model 1, (Chen 1993) used word translation probabilities, which he showed gives better accuracy than the sentence length based method. $$$$$ However, modeling word order under translation is notoriously difficult (Brown ei al., 1993), and it is unclear how much improvement in accuracy a good model of word order would provide.
By adopting the IBM model 1, (Chen 1993) used word translation probabilities, which he showed gives better accuracy than the sentence length based method. $$$$$ The natural next step in sentence alignment is to account for word ordering in the translation model, e.g., the models described in (Brown et al., 1993) could be used.

(Simard and Plamondon 1996) used a two-pass approach, where the first pass performs length-based alignment at the character level as in (Gale and Church 1993) and the second pass uses IBM Model 1, following (Chen 1993). $$$$$ In the incremental version of the EM algorithm we use, instead of re-estimating parameters after each complete pass through the corpus, we re-estimate parameters after each sentence.

Each type of the web page sentence aligner makes use of three conventional sentence alignment models, one is the length based model following (Brown 1991), one is the lexicon based model following (Chen 1993), and the other one is the hybrid model presented in (Zhao 2002). $$$$$ To model 1

Other examples of lexical methods are Warwick et al (1989), Mayers et al (1998), Chen (1993) and Haruno and Yamazaki (1996). $$$$$ Aligned bilingual corpora have proved useful in many tasks, including machine translation (Brown et al., 1990; Sadler, 1989), sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991a; Dagan et al., 1991; Gale et al., 1992), and bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990; Warwick and Russell, 1990).

Chen (1993) constructs a simple word-to-word translation model and then takes the alignment that maximizes the likelihood of generating the corpus given the translation model. $$$$$ We find the alignment that maximizes the probability of generating the corpus with this translation model.
