Evaluation is sped up by using a compact word lattice view for eliciting human judgments, built using the syntactic fusion algorithm of (Pang et al, 2003). $$$$$ In the second step (line 6), we extract an FSA from the parse forest and then we compact it further using a limited form of bottom-up alignment, which we call squeezing (line 7).

Earlier, Barzilay and Lee (2003) and Pang et al (2003) developed approaches to aligning multiple reference translations in order to extract para phrases and generate new sentences. $$$$$ Syntax-Based Alignment Of Multiple Translations

Pang et al (Pang et al, 2003) used parallel monolingual corpora built from news stories that had been independently translated several times to learn lattices from a syntax-based alignment process. $$$$$ Bangalore et al. (2001) and Barzilay and Lee (2002) both applied the technique of multi-sequence alignment (MSA) to align parallel corpora and produced similar FSAs.
Pang et al (Pang et al, 2003) used parallel monolingual corpora built from news stories that had been independently translated several times to learn lattices from a syntax-based alignment process. $$$$$ These stories were independently translated into English by 11 translation agencies.

Pang et al provide a remedy to this problem by performing alignment on the Charniak parse trees of the clustered sentences (Pang et al, 2003). $$$$$ And researchers in multi-document text summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999), information extraction (Shinyama et al., 2002), and question answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Hermjakob et al., 2002) have focused on identifying and exploiting paraphrases in the context of recognizing redundancies, alternative formulations of the same meaning, and improving the performance of question answering systems.
Pang et al provide a remedy to this problem by performing alignment on the Charniak parse trees of the clustered sentences (Pang et al, 2003). $$$$$ Given a sentence group, we pass each of the 11 sentences to Charniak’s (2000) parser to get 11 parse trees.

Our work is closest in spirit to the two papers that inspired us (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) and (Pang et al, 2003). $$$$$ Bangalore et al. (2001) and Barzilay and Lee (2002) both applied the technique of multi-sequence alignment (MSA) to align parallel corpora and produced similar FSAs.

Pang et al (2003) propose an algorithm to align sets of parallel sentences driven entirely by the syntactic representations of the sentences. $$$$$ They can be used to extract lexical and syntactic paraphrase pairs and to generate new, unseen sentences that express the same meaning as the sentences in the input sets.

Pang et al (2003) use word lattices as paraphrase representations from semantically equivalent translations sets. $$$$$ In previous work (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002), paraphrases are represented as sets or pairs of semantically equivalent words, phrases, and patterns.

On the basis of this hypothesis, Barzi lay and McKeown (2001) and Pang et al2003) created monolingual parallel corpora from multiple human translations of the same source. $$$$$ Bangalore et al.

On the basis of this hypothesis, Barzi lay and McKeown (2001) and Pang et al2003) created monolingual parallel corpora from multiple human translations of the same source. $$$$$ Since the co-training-based algorithm of Barzilay and McKeown (2001) takes parallel corpus as input, we created out of the MTC corpus 55 × 993 sentence pairs (Each equivalent translation set of cardinality 11 was mapped into (2) equivalent translation pairs.).
