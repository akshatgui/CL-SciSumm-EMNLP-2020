However, little research has been done on how to effectively perform SRL on bi text, which has important applications including machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009). $$$$$ Oracle analysis of n-best lists and lattices show that they often focus on lexical choice alternatives rather than re-ordering / role variations which are more important to semantic adequacy.

Finally in the post-processing approach category, Wu and Fung (2009) performed semantic role labeling on translation output and reordered arguments to maximize the cross-lingual match of the semantic frames between the source sentence and the target translation. $$$$$ Such models, which identify semantic frames within input sentences by marking its predicates, and labeling their arguments with the semantic roles that they fill.

Wu and Fung (2009) demonstrated the promise of using features based on semantic predicate argument structure in machine translation, using these feature to re-rank machine translation output. $$$$$ The first pass is performed using a conventional phrase-based SMT model.

Wu and Fung (2009) used SRL labels for reordering the n-best output of phrase-based translation systems. $$$$$ The phrase-based SMT model used for the first pass achieves a BLEU score of 42.99, establishing a fairly strong baseline to begin with.
Wu and Fung (2009) used SRL labels for reordering the n-best output of phrase-based translation systems. $$$$$ Whereas ReWrite was based on wordlevel re-ordering, however, our approach is based on constituent phrase re-ordering, and the phrases to be re-ordered are more selectively chosen via the semantic parse labels.

Recently, Wu and Fung (2009a; 2009b) also show that semantic roles help in statistical machine translation , capitalising on a study of the correspondence between English and Chinese which indicates that 84% of roles transfer directly, for PropBank-style annotations. $$$$$ Many of the most glaring errors made by today’s statistical machine translation systems are those resulting from confusion of semantic roles.

Recent years have witnessed increasing efforts towards integrating predicate-argument structures into statistical machine translation (SMT) (Wu and Fung, 2009b; Liu and Gildea, 2010). $$$$$ Shallow semantic parsing models have attained increasing levels of accuracy in recent years (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000; Sun and Jurafsky 2004; Pradhan et al. 2004, 2005; Pradhan 2005; Fung et al.

As PAS analysis widely employs global and sentence-wide features, it is computationally expensive to integrate target side predicate argument structures into the dynamic programming style of SMT decoding (Wu and Fung, 2009b). $$$$$ In fact, the lack of easy compositionality is the reason that today’s most accurate shallow semantic parsers rely not primarily on compositional parsing techniques, but rather on ensembles of predictors that independently rate/rank a wide variety of factors supporting the role assignments given a broad sentence-wide range of context features.

With the current architecture of machine translation decoders, few ways of incorporating semantics in MT output include using word sense disambiguation to select the correct target translation (Carpuat and Wu, 2007) and reordering/reranking MT output based on semantic consistencies (Wu and Fung, 2009b) (Carpuat et al, 2010). $$$$$ Over the past decade, we have seen an accumulation of evidence that SMT accuracy can be improved via tree-structured and syntactic models (e.g., Wu 1997; Wu and Chiang 2009), and more recently, work from lexical semantics has also at long last been successfully applied to increasing SMT accuracy, in the form of techniques adapted from word sense disambiguation models (Chan et al. 2007; Gimenez and Mˆrquez 2007b; Carpuat and Wu 2007).

Other statistical translation specific applications we would like to explore include extensions of MT output reordering (Wu and Fung, 2009b) and reranking using predicate-argument mapping, as well as predicate-argument projection onto the target language as an evaluation metric for MT output. $$$$$ We note that accuracy here was measured via BLEU, and it has been widely observed that the negative impacts of semantic predicate-argument errors on the utility of the translation are underestimated by evaluation metrics based on lexical criteria such as BLEU.

Our approach is inline with Wu and Fung (2009b) who demonstrated that on the one hand 84% of verb syntactic functions in a 50-sentence test corpus projected from Chinese to English, and that on the other hand about 15% of the subjects were not translated into subjects, but their semantic roles were preserved across language. $$$$$ Across Chinese and English, for example, it has been reported that approximately 84% of semantic roles are preserved consistently (Fung et al. 2006).

One problem with using BLEU as an evaluation metric is that it is a precision-oriented metric and tends to reward fluency rather than adequacy (see (Wu and Fung, 2009a; Liu and Gildea, 2010)). $$$$$ It has often been noted that the dominance of lexically-oriented, precisionbased metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002) tend to reward fluency more than adequacy.
