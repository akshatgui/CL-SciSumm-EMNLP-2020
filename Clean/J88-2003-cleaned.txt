Presuming a tripartite event structure (Moens and Steedman, 1988) consisting of a preparation phase (dynamic phase theta dyn), a culmination point (boundary tau) and a consequent state (static phase phi stat), there are three possibilities for aspect to select. $$$$$ This new state we will refer to as the consequent state of the event.

We decompose each event E into a tripartite structure in a manner similar to Moens and Steedman (1988), introducing a time function for each predicate to specify whether the predicate is true in the preparatory (during (E)), culmination (end (E)), or consequent (result: (E)) stage of an event. $$$$$ Its result is the corresponding consequent state.

Consider the following examples, from Ritchie (1979) and Moens and Steedman (1988). $$$$$ Consider the following examples, suggested by Ritchie 1979: To map the temporal relations expressed in these examples onto linear time, and to try to express the semantics of when in terms of points or intervals (possibly associated with events), would appear to imply either that when is multiply ambiguous, allowing these points or intervals to be temporally related in at least three different ways, or that the relation expressed between main and when-clauses is one of approximate coincidence.

The latter would accord with a theoretical distinction that has been made between post posed when expressing a purely temporal relation between the two clauses, and proposed when ex pressing a contingent relation between them (Moens and Steedman, 1988). $$$$$ However, neither of these tactics explains the peculiarity of utterances like the following: The unusual character of this statement seems to arise because the when-clause predicates something more than mere temporal coincidence, that is, some contingent relation such as a causal link or an enablement relation between the two events.
