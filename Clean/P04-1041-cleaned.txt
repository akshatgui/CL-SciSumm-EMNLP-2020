The research presented in this paper forms part of an ongoing effort to develop methods to induce wide-coverage multilingual Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 2001) resources from tree banks by means of automatically associating LFG f-structure information with constituency trees produced by probabilistic parsers (Cahill et al, 2004). $$$$$ This paper shows how finite approximations of long distance dependency (LDD) resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) resources acquired from treebanks.

Some properties of Spanish and the encoding of syntactic information in the Cast3LB treebank make it non-trivial to apply the method of automatically mapping c-structures to f-structures used by Cahill et al (2004), which assigns grammatical functions to tree nodes based on their phrasal category, the category of the mother node and their position relative to the local head. $$$$$ NP ?
