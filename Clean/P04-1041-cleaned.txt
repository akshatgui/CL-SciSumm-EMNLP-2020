The research presented in this paper forms part of an ongoing effort to develop methods to induce wide-coverage multilingual Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 2001) resources from tree banks by means of automatically associating LFG f-structure information with constituency trees produced by probabilistic parsers (Cahill et al, 2004). $$$$$ This paper shows how finite approximations of long distance dependency (LDD) resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) resources acquired from treebanks.
