Toutanova et al (2005) introduced one of the first joint approaches for SRL and demonstrated that a model that scores the full predicate argument structure of a parse tree could lead to significant error reduction over independent classifiers for each predicate-argument relation. $$$$$ In this framework, we can define arbitrary features of labeled trees that capture general properties of predicate-argument structure.
Toutanova et al (2005) introduced one of the first joint approaches for SRL and demonstrated that a model that scores the full predicate argument structure of a parse tree could lead to significant error reduction over independent classifiers for each predicate-argument relation. $$$$$ As our results show, the error reduction of our joint model with respect to the local model is more modest in this setting.

 $$$$$ Suppose we want the most likely consistent assignment for subtree t with children trees t1, ... , tk each storing the most likely consistent assignment of nodes it dominates as well as the log-probability of the assignment of all nodes it dominates to NONE.

Accordingly, we do not maximize the probability of the entire labeled parse tree as in (Toutanova et al, 2005). $$$$$ In the context of role labeling, we call a classifier local if it assigns a probability (or score) to the label of an individual parse tree node ni independently of the labels of other nodes.
Accordingly, we do not maximize the probability of the entire labeled parse tree as in (Toutanova et al, 2005). $$$$$ This sequence of labeled nodes is defined with respect to the left-to-right order of constituents in the parse tree.

To enforce this constraint, we employ the approach presented by Toutanova et al (2005). $$$$$ Thus we do not have accuracy loss as in the two-pass hard prune strategy described in (Pradhan et al., 2005).
To enforce this constraint, we employ the approach presented by Toutanova et al (2005). $$$$$ One advantage of log-linear models over SVMs for us is that they produce probability distributions and thus identification A problem with this approach is that a maximizing labeling of the nodes could possibly violate the constraint that argument nodes should not overlap with each other.

We implemented a global reranker following Toutanova et al (2005). $$$$$ (Punyakanok et al., 2004) use a linear programming framework to ensure that the only argument frames which get probability mass are ones that respect global constraints on argument labels.

Statistical parsers are major components in NLP applications such as QA (Kwok et al, 2001), MT (Marcu et al, 2006) and SRL (Toutanova et al, 2005). $$$$$ The release of semantically annotated corpora such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2003) has made it possible to develop high-accuracy statistical models for automated semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004).
Statistical parsers are major components in NLP applications such as QA (Kwok et al, 2001), MT (Marcu et al, 2006) and SRL (Toutanova et al, 2005). $$$$$ The standard features at the top of the table were defined by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and the rest are other useful lexical and structural features identified in more recent work (Pradhan et al., 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Xue and Palmer, 2004).

We employ this decomposition mainly for efficiency in training: that is, the decomposition allows us to train the classification models on a subset of training examples consisting only of those phrases that have a case marker, following Toutanova et al (2005). $$$$$ Our local models for semantic role labeling use this decomposition.

Toutanova et al (2005) report a substantial improvement in performance on the semantic role labeling task by building a joint classifier, which takes the labels of other phrases into account when classifying a given phrase. $$$$$ We call such phrases fillers of semantic roles and our task is, given a sentence and a target verb, to return all such phrases along with their correct labels.

We applied the joint classifiers in the framework of N-best re ranking (Collins, 2000), following Toutanova et al (2005). $$$$$ Therefore, in order to be able to incorporate long-range dependencies in our models, we chose to adopt a re-ranking approach (Collins, 2000), which selects from likely assignments generated by a model which makes stronger independence assumptions.

Our system, on the other hand, follows a joint approach in the spirit of Toutanova et al (2005) and performs the above steps collectively. $$$$$ Thus we do not have accuracy loss as in the two-pass hard prune strategy described in (Pradhan et al., 2005).

In addition, while the system described here is based on pipelined classification, recent research on semantic role labeling has shown that significant performance improvements can be gained by exploiting interdependencies between arguments (Toutanova et al., 2005). $$$$$ In classification, we are given a set of arguments in t and must label each one with its appropriate semantic role.

In a recent paper on the SRL on verbal predicates for English, (Toutanova et al, 2005) pointed out that one potential flaw in a SRL system where each argument is considered on its own is that it does not take advantage of the fact that the arguments (not the adjuncts) of a predicate are subject to the hard constraint that they do not have the same label. $$$$$ For example, there are hard constraints – that arguments cannot overlap with each other or the predicate, and also soft constraints – for example, is it unlikely that a predicate will have two or more AGENT arguments, or that a predicate used in the active voice will have a THEME argument prior to an AGENT argument.

The system, introduced in (Toutanova et al, 2005), implements a joint model that captures dependencies among arguments of a predicate using log-linear models in a discriminative re-ranking framework. $$$$$ We propose a discriminative log-linear joint model for semantic role labeling, which incorporates more global features and achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art models.

We find the exact top N consistent most likely local model labelings using a simple dynamic program described in (Toutanova et al, 2005). $$$$$ Here we describe a fast exact dynamic programming algorithm to find the most likely non-overlapping (consistent) labeling of all nodes in the parse tree, according to a product of probabilities from local models, as in Equation 2.
