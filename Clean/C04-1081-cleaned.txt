Work by Peng et al (2004) first used this framework for Chinese word segmentation by treating it as a binary decision task, such that each character is labeled either as the beginning of a word or the continuation of one. $$$$$ Un fortunately, building a Chinese word segmentation system is complicated by the fact that there is no standard definition of word boundaries in Chinese.
