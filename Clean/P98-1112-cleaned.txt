Verb classifications have, in fact, been used to support many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as language generation, machine translation (Dorr, 1997), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996) and sub categorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002). $$$$$ Many natural language analysis systems focus on nouns and noun phrases in order to identify information on who, what, and where.

Knowledge about verb classes is crucial for lexical acquisition in support of language generation and machine translation (Dolt, 1997) and document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), yet manual classification of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task (Levm, 1993 Miller et al , 1990, Dang et al, 1998). $$$$$ Wacholder et al. 1997, Palmer and Day 1997, Neumann et al.

Out of the large syntactic constituents of a sentence, e.g. noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases, we assume that noun phrases (NPs) carry the most contentful information about the document, even if sometimes the verbs are important too, as reported in the work by [Klavans and Kan (1998)]. $$$$$ Many natural language analysis systems focus on nouns and noun phrases in order to identify information on who, what, and where.

In document classification, Klavans and Kan (1998) demonstrate that document type is correlated with the presence of many verbs of a certain EVCA class (Levin 1993). $$$$$ We present techniques to characterize document type and event by using semantic classification of verbs.
In document classification, Klavans and Kan (1998) demonstrate that document type is correlated with the presence of many verbs of a certain EVCA class (Levin 1993). $$$$$ Correlations can range from -1.0 reflecting inverse correlation, to +1.0 showing direct correlation, i.e. the presence of one class increases as the presence of the correlated verb class increases.
