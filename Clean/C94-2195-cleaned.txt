Since Eric Brill first introduced the method of Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) it has been used to learn rules for many natural anguage processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging [Brill, 1995], PP attachment disambiguation [Brill and Resnik, 1994], text chunking [Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995], spelling correction [Mangu and Brill, 1997], dialogue act tagging [Samuel et al, 1998] and ellipsis resolution [Hardt, 1998]. $$$$$ A Rule-Based Approach To Prepositional Phrase Attachment Disambiguation

Brill and Resnik (1994) used the supervised transformation-based learning method and lexical and conceptual classes derived from WordNet, achieving 82% precision on 500 randomly selected examples. $$$$$ They then suggest using lexical preference, estimated from a large corpus of text, as a method of re- solving attachment ambiguity, a technique the}' call "lexical association."

This huge number of tokens can be explained by the fact that the lexicon used for tokenization and tagging integrates many multi-word expressions which are not part of these mantic lexicon for (Brill and Resnik, 1994) and 0.77 for (LauerandDras, 1994)), but a direct comparison is difficult inasmuch as only three-word sequences (V N P, for (Brill and Resnik, 1994) and N N N for (Lauer and Dras, 1994)) were used for evaluation in those works, and the language studied is English. $$$$$ ZIn transformation #8, word token amount appears because it was used as the head noun for noun phrases representing percentage amounts, e.g. "5%."
