Fidditch is one such deterministic parser, designed to provide a syntactic analysis of text as a tool for locating examples of various linguistically interesting structures (Hindle 1983). $$$$$ Other cases (examples 610 below) are only interpretable given the assumption that certain words, which are potentially part of the syntactic structure, are to be removed from the syntactic analysis.
Fidditch is one such deterministic parser, designed to provide a syntactic analysis of text as a tool for locating examples of various linguistically interesting structures (Hindle 1983). $$$$$ Because it is a deterministic parser, it produces only one analysis for each sentence.

Hindle (1983) addressed the problem of correcting self repairs by adding rules to a deterministic parser that would remove the necessary text. $$$$$ Because it is a deterministic parser, it produces only one analysis for each sentence.
Hindle (1983) addressed the problem of correcting self repairs by adding rules to a deterministic parser that would remove the necessary text. $$$$$ The copy editing rules remove a constituent, no matter how large, from the view of the parser.

 $$$$$ Although the self-corrected string is edited from the syntactic analysis, it is nevertheless available for semantic interpretation.

Example: I think that you get - it is more strict in Catholic schools. (Hindle 1983). $$$$$ For example, in sentence (1), the speaker initially said / but meant we.

(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration. $$$$$ The status of the material that is corrected by selfcorrection and is expunged by the editing rules is somewhat odd.

RIM builds upon Labov (1966) and Hindle (1983) by conceptually extending the EDIT SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS that repairs are acoustically or phonetically marked at the point of interruption of fluent speech. $$$$$ Two features are essential to the self-correction system: 1) every self-correction site (whether it results in the expunction of words or not) is marked by a phonetically identifiable signal placed at the right edge of the potential expunction site; and 2) the expunged part is the left-hand member of a pair of copies, one on each side of the editing signal.

One proposal for repair processing that lends itself to both incremental processing and the integration of speech cues into repair detection is that of Hindle (1983), who defines a typology of repairs and associated correction strategies in terms of extensions to a deterministic parser. $$$$$ The editing system that I will describe is implemented on top of a deterministic parser, called Fidditch. based on the processing principles proposed by Marcus (1980).

An hypothesized acoustic phonetic edit signal, "a markedly abrupt cut-off of the speech signal" (Hindle, 1983 ,p.123), is assumed to mark the interruption of fluent speech (cf.

Importantly, Hindle's system allows for non surface-based corrections and sequential application of correction rules (Hindle, 1983, p. 123). $$$$$ SURFACE COPY EDITOR.
Importantly, Hindle's system allows for non surface-based corrections and sequential application of correction rules (Hindle, 1983, p. 123). $$$$$ Such cases where the Surface Copy Editor must apply are rare, and it may therefore be that there exists an optimal parser grammar that would make the Surface Copy Editor redundant; all strings would be edited by the syntactically based Category and Stack Copy rules.

RIM incorporates two main assumptions of Hindle (1983): (1) correction strategies are linguistically rule-governed, and (2) linguistic ues must be available to signal when a disfluency has occurred and to 'trigger' correction strategies. $$$$$ Thus, the observed pattern of self-correction introduces empirical constraints on the set of features that are available for syntactic rules.

Other than syntactic knowledge includes grammar specific recovery rules such as recta-rules (Weishedel and Sondheimer, 1983), semantic or pragmatic knowledge which may depend on a particular domain (Carbonell and Hayes, 1983) or the characteristics of the ill-formed utterances observed in human discourse (Hindle, 1983). $$$$$ The category copying rules are generalizations of simple copying, applied to a knowledge of linguistic categories.
