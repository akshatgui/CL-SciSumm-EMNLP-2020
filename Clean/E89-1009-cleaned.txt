Several lexical representation formalisms addressing these desiderata have been proposed, e.g. DATR [Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b, 1990]; LRL [Copestake, 1992]; [Russell et al 1991]. $$$$$ de Smedt (1984), Flickinger et al.

Analyses in Network Morphology are implemented in DATR, a formal language for representing lexical knowledge designed and implemented by Roger Evans and Gerald Gazdar (Evans and Gazdar, 1989). $$$$$ This fact has not gone unnoticed by a number of researchers working on lexical knowledge representation, e.g.

DATR was originally introduced by Evans and Gazdar (1989a; 1989b) as a simple, non monotonic language for representing lexical inheritance hierarchies. $$$$$ a declarative language for representing a restricted class of inheritance networks, permitting both multiple and default inheritance.
DATR was originally introduced by Evans and Gazdar (1989a; 1989b) as a simple, non monotonic language for representing lexical inheritance hierarchies. $$$$$ The operation of path closure is non-monotonic

The original publications on DATR sought to provide the language with (1) a formal theory of inference (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a) and (2) a model-theoretic semantics (Evans and Gazdar, 1989b). $$$$$ Inference In DATR
