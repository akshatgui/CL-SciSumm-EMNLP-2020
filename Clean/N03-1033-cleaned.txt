The algorithms were trained and tested using version 3 of the Penn Treebank, using the training, development, and test split described in Collins (2002) and also employed by Toutanova et al (2003) in testing their supervised tagging algorithm. $$$$$ We extracted tagged sentences from the parse trees.5 We split the data into training, development, and test sets as in (Collins, 2002).

We used the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003 ) v3.1, with the MEMM model. $$$$$ Words surrounding the current word have been occasionally used in taggers, such as (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), Brill’s transformation based tagger (Brill, 1995), and the HMM model of Lee et al. (2000), but nevertheless, the only lexicalization consistently included in tagging models is the dependence of the part of speech tag of a word on the word itself.

For the discriminative distortion models, we tag the pre-processed input using the log-linear POS tagger of Toutanova et al (2003). $$$$$ The per-state models in this paper are log-linear models, building upon the models in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and (Toutanova and Manning, 2000), though some models are in fact strictly simpler.
