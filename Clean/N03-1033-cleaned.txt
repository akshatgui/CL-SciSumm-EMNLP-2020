Recently, Toutanova et al (2003) presented a supervised conditional Markov Model part-of-speech tagger (CMM) which exploited information coming from both left and right contexts. $$$$$ In essence, there is no difference between inference on this network and a second-order left-to-right CMM or HMM.

The algorithms were trained and tested using version 3 of the Penn Treebank, using the training, development, and test split described in Collins (2002) and also employed by Toutanova et al (2003) in testing their supervised tagging algorithm. $$$$$ We extracted tagged sentences from the parse trees.5 We split the data into training, development, and test sets as in (Collins, 2002).

We used the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al, 2003 ) v3.1, with the MEMM model. $$$$$ Words surrounding the current word have been occasionally used in taggers, such as (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), Brill’s transformation based tagger (Brill, 1995), and the HMM model of Lee et al. (2000), but nevertheless, the only lexicalization consistently included in tagging models is the dependence of the part of speech tag of a word on the word itself.

For the discriminative distortion models, we tag the pre-processed input using the log-linear POS tagger of Toutanova et al (2003). $$$$$ The per-state models in this paper are log-linear models, building upon the models in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and (Toutanova and Manning, 2000), though some models are in fact strictly simpler.

We use the log-linear tagger of Toutanova et al (2003), which gives 96.8% accuracy on the test set. $$$$$ Model L+R, using both tags simultaneously (but with only the individual-direction features) gives a much better accuracy of 96.57%.

We also added part of speech (POS) tags to the data using the tagger of Toutanova et al (2003), and used the tags to decide if mentions were plural or singular. $$$$$ The part of speech tagged data used in our experiments is the Wall Street Journal data from Penn Treebank III (Marcus et al., 1994).
We also added part of speech (POS) tags to the data using the tagger of Toutanova et al (2003), and used the tags to decide if mentions were plural or singular. $$$$$ Models LL, RR, and CR use only the vertical features and a single set of tag-triple features: the left tags (t−2, t−1 and t0), right tags (t0, t+1, t+2), or centered tags (t−1, t0, t+1) respectively.
