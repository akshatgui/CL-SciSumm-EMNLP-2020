 $$$$$ Words or n-gramsappearing in less than 0.5% of the training set sen tences do not constitute a feature.
 $$$$$ While hashtag labels arespecific to Twitter data, the obtained feature vectors are not heavily Twitter-specific and in the fu ture we would like to explore the applicability ofTwitter data for sentiment multi-class identifica tion and classification in other domains.

Evaluation is performed on several datasets of tweets that have been annotated for polarity: the Stanford Twitter Sentiment set (Go et al, 2009), Davidov et al (2010) use 15 emoticons and 50 Twitter hash tags as proxies for sentiment in a similar manner, but their evaluation is indirect. $$$$$ Others combine additional feature types for this decision (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al, 2005; Bloom et al, 2007; McDonald et al, 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008a; Melville et al, 2009).
