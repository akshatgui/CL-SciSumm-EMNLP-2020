Hobbs and Shieber (1987) extend this formalism to support operators (such as not) and present an enumeration algorithm that is more efficient than the naive wrapping approach. $$$$$ While this algorithm can sometimes result in a significant savings over the naive approach, it by no means solves the entire quantifier scoping problem, as we have already pointed out.

The sentence has 42 readings (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987), and it is easy to imagine how the number of readings grows exponentially (or worse) in the length of the sentence. $$$$$ But for the sentence there are not six different readings, but only five.
The sentence has 42 readings (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987), and it is easy to imagine how the number of readings grows exponentially (or worse) in the length of the sentence. $$$$$ The reduction in number of readings for a given sentence is not significant for sentence (1), but in the sentence there are only 42 valid readings, as opposed to the 120 readings the naive algorithm would generate, and this Copyright 1987 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

In summary, however, the analysis is slightly more restrictive than that of Hobbs and Shieber (1987), making predictions regarding the scope of topicalized or wh-moved constituents, relative scope of embedded quantifiers, and possibly even syntactic structure of complex NPs. $$$$$ It will ultimately yield a reading in which r outscopes d but is outscoped by c; the complex term for c is still available for an application that will give it wide Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 53 Jerry R.

In summary, however, the analysis is slightly more restrictive than that of Hobbs and Shieber (1987), making predictions regarding the scope of topicalized or wh-moved constituents, relative scope of embedded quantifiers, and possibly even syntactic structure of complex NPs. $$$$$ So by the induction hypothesis, the computation of y terminates and p(y) < m. Also, the computation of 8 is assumed to terminate (as mentioned above) with 8 missing the complex term t that occurs in a (and possibly other complex terms embedded within 1).

For example, in processing (22) (adapted from Hobbs and Shieber 1987), which Park 1995 claims to have only four readings, rather than the five predicted by their account, such a system can build both readings for the S/NP every representative of three companies saw and decide which is more likely, before building both compatible readings of the whole sentence and similarly resolving with respect to statistical or contextual support: (22) Every representative of three companies aw some sample. $$$$$ But for the sentence there are not six different readings, but only five.

[Hobbs and Shieber 1987] presented an algorithm to generate quantifier scopings from a representation of predicate-argument relations and the relations of grammatical subordination. $$$$$ The syntactic structure of a sentence often manifests quite clearly the predicate-argument structure and relations of grammatical subordination.
