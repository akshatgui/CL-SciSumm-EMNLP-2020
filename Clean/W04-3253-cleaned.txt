For instance, instead of representing the polarity of a term using a binary value, Mullen and Collier (2004) use Turney's (2002) method to assign a real value to represent term polarity and introduce a variety of numerical features that are aggregate measures of the polarity values of terms selected from the document under consideration. $$$$$ We describe the methods used to assign values to selected words and phrases, and we introduce a method of bringing them together to create a model for the classification of texts.

Mullen and Collier (2004) used SVMs and expanded the feature set for representing documents with favor ability measures from a variety of diverse sources. $$$$$ This paper introduces an approach to sentiment analysis which uses support vector machines (SVMs) to bring together diverse sources of potentially pertinent information, including several favorability measures for phrases and adjectives and, where available, knowledge of the topic of the text.
Mullen and Collier (2004) used SVMs and expanded the feature set for representing documents with favor ability measures from a variety of diverse sources. $$$$$ The present approach emphasizes the use of a variety of diverse information sources, and SVMs provide the ideal tool to bring these sources together.

 $$$$$ A SO value of zero would indicate a completely neutral semantic orientation.
 $$$$$ The approach presented here is flexible and suggests promising avenues of further investigation.

Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004) integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors and some syntactic relations into the features of SVM. $$$$$ The three values correspond to the potency (strong or weak), activity (active or passive) and the evaluative (good or bad) factors introduced in Charles Osgoodâ€™s Theory of Semantic Differentiation (Osgood et al., 1957).
Mullen and Collier (Mullen and Collier, 2004) integrated PMI values, Osgood semantic factors and some syntactic relations into the features of SVM. $$$$$ In addition to the features employed with the first dataset, this dataset allows the use those features described in 3.3 which make use of topic information, namely the broader PMI derived SO values and the topicsentence Osgood values.

 $$$$$ A SO value of zero would indicate a completely neutral semantic orientation.
 $$$$$ The approach presented here is flexible and suggests promising avenues of further investigation.

Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). $$$$$ The present approach emphasizes the use of a variety of diverse information sources, and SVMs provide the ideal tool to bring these sources together.
Another method is to use proximal information of the query and the word, using syntactic structure such as dependency relations of words that provide the graphical representation of the text (Mullen and Collier, 2004). $$$$$ The present models may also be further expanded with features representing other information sources, which may include other types of semantic annotation (Wiebe, 2002), or features based on more sophisticated grammatical or dependency relations or on zone information.

Mullen and Collier (2004) manually annotated named entities in their dataset (i.e. title of the record and name of the artist for music record reviews), and utilized presence and position features in their ML approach. $$$$$ In each record review, references (including co-reference) to the record being reviewed were tagged as THIS WORK and references to the artist under review were tagged as THIS ARTIST.
Mullen and Collier (2004) manually annotated named entities in their dataset (i.e. title of the record and name of the artist for music record reviews), and utilized presence and position features in their ML approach. $$$$$ 2 The second dataset consists of 100 record reviews from the Pitchfork Media online record review publication,3 topic-annotated by hand.

Mullen and Collier (2004), for example, uses WordNet to add information about words found within text, and consequently reports improved classification performance in a sentiment analysis task. $$$$$ This paper introduces an approach to sentiment analysis which uses support vector machines (SVMs) to bring together diverse sources of potentially pertinent information, including several favorability measures for phrases and adjectives and, where available, knowledge of the topic of the text.
Mullen and Collier (2004), for example, uses WordNet to add information about words found within text, and consequently reports improved classification performance in a sentiment analysis task. $$$$$ A continual challenge in the task of sentiment analysis of a text is to home in on those aspects of the text which are in some way representative of the tone of the whole text.
