 $$$$$ Finally, although the case study of accent restoration in Spanish and French was chosen for its diversity of ambiguity types and plentiful source of data for fully automatic and objective evaluation, the algorithm solves a worthwhile problem in its own right with promising commercial potential.

Until now, many methods have been proposed for this problem including winnow-based algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1999), differential grammars (Powers, 1998), transformation based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994). $$$$$ This paper presents a general-purpose statistical decision procedure for lexical ambiguity resolution based on decision lists (Rivest, 1987).

In cases like (Yarowsky, 1995), unsupervised methods offer accuracy results than rival supervised methods (Yarowsky,1994) while requiring only a fraction of the data preparation effort. $$$$$ In particular, precision seems to be at least as good as that achieved with Bayesian methods applied to the same evidence.

Decision lists (Rivest, 1987) have been used for a variety of natural language tasks, including accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 2000), finding the past tense of English verbs (Mooney and Califf, 1995), and several other problems. $$$$$ Accent restoration is merely an instance of a closelyrelated class of problems including word-sense disambiguation, word choice selection in machine translation, homograph and homophone disambiguation, and capitalization restoration.

The standard algorithm for learning decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994) is very simple. $$$$$ Decision Lists For Lexical Ambiguity Resolution: Application To Accent Restoration In Spanish And French
The standard algorithm for learning decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994) is very simple. $$$$$ Step 7: Using the Decision Lists Once these decision lists have been created, they may be used in real time to determine the accent pattern for ambiguous words in new contexts.

Yarowsky (1994) suggests two improvements to the standard algorithm. $$$$$ The given algorithm may be used to solve each of these problems, and has been applied without modification to the case of homograph disambiguation in speech synthesis (Sproat, Hirschberg and Yarowsky, 1992).
Yarowsky (1994) suggests two improvements to the standard algorithm. $$$$$ In a comparative study (Yarowsky, 1994), the decision list algorithm outperformed both an N-Gram tagger and Bayesian classifier primarily because it could effectively integrate a wider range of available evidence types than its competitors.

Accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 2000), and other problems all fall into this framework, and typically use similar feature types. $$$$$ Accent restoration is merely an instance of a closelyrelated class of problems including word-sense disambiguation, word choice selection in machine translation, homograph and homophone disambiguation, and capitalization restoration.

They include those using Naive Bayes (Gale et al 1992a), Decision List (Yarowsky 1994), Nearest Neighbor (Ng and Lee 1996), Transformation Based Learning (Mangu and Brill 1997), Neural Network (Towell and 1 In this paper, we take English-Chinese translation as example; it is a relatively easy process, however, to extend the discussions to translations between other language pairs. $$$$$ This was expanded upon by (Gale et al., 1992), and in a class-based variant by (Yarowsky, 1992).

Yarowsky (1994) notes that conceptual spelling correction is part of a closely related class of problems which include word sense disambiguation, word choice selection in machine translation, and accent and capitalization restoration. $$$$$ Thus while accent restoration may not be be the prototypical member of the class of lexical-ambiguity resolution problems, it is an especially useful one for describing and evaluating a proposed solution to this class of problems.

Lemmatization allows for more compact and generalizable data by clustering all inflected forms of an ambiguous word together, an effect already commented on by Yarowsky (1994). $$$$$ For example, if lemmatization procedures are available, collocational measures for morphological roots will tend to yield more succinct and generalizable evidence than measuring the distributions for each of the inflected forms.
Lemmatization allows for more compact and generalizable data by clustering all inflected forms of an ambiguous word together, an effect already commented on by Yarowsky (1994). $$$$$ The incorporation of word (and optionally part-of-speech) trigrams allows the modeling of many local syntactic constraints, while collocational evidence in a wider context allows for more semantic distinctions.

As has already been noted by Yarowsky (1994), using lemmas helps to produce more concise and generic evidence than inflected forms. $$$$$ Note that it's not necessary to determine the actual parts-of-speech of words in context; using only the most likely part of speech or a set of all possibilities will produce adequate, if somewhat diluted, distributional evidence.
As has already been noted by Yarowsky (1994), using lemmas helps to produce more concise and generic evidence than inflected forms. $$$$$ Use of a morphological analyzer (developed by Tzoukermann and Liberman (1990)) allowed distributional measures to be computed for associations of lemmas (morphological roots), improving generalization to different inflected forms not observed in the training data.

Yarowsky (1994) defined a basic set of features that has been widely used (with some variations) by other WSD systems. $$$$$ Basic corpus analysis will indicate which is the most common pattern for each word, and may be used in conjunction with or independent of dictionaries and other lexical resources.

Despite their simplicity, Decision Lists (Dlist for short) as defined in Yarowsky (1994) have been shown to be very effective for WSD (Kilgarriff & Palmer, 2000). $$$$$ Decision Lists For Lexical Ambiguity Resolution: Application To Accent Restoration In Spanish And French

In general, the strategy adopted to model syntagmatic relations in WSD is to provide bigrams and trigrams of collocated words as features to describe local contexts (Yarowsky, 1994). $$$$$ Perhaps surprisingly, this strategy appears to yield the same or even slightly better precision than the combination of evidence approach when trained on the same features.

Yarowsky (1994 and 1995), Mihalcea and Moldovan (2000), and Mihalcea (2002) have made further research to obtain large corpus of higher quality from an initial seed corpus. $$$$$ Thus the following results must be interpreted as agreement rates with the corpus accent pattern; the true percent correct may be several percentage points higher.

In general, the strategy adopted to model syntagmatic relations is to provide bigrams and trigrams of collocated words as features to describe local contexts (Yarowsky, 1994), and each word is regarded as a different instance to classify. $$$$$ I have restricted feature conjuncts to a much narrower complexity than allowed in the original model— namely to word and class trigrams.

As baseline, we report the result of a standard approach consisting on explicit bigrams and trigrams of words and POS tags around the words to be disambiguated (Yarowsky, 1994). $$$$$ Such words were given a part-of-speech tag consisting of the union of the possibilities (eg ADJECTIVE-NOUN), as in Kupiec (1989).

Yarowsky (1994) argued the optimal value is sensitive to the type of ambiguity. $$$$$ Sorting by this value will list the strongest and most reliable evidence first6.
