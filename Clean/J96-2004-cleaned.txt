Following the works of Carletta (1996) and Artstein and Poesio (2008), there is an increasing consensus within the field that in order to properly gauge the reliability of an annotation effort, chance-corrected measures of inter-annotator agreement should be used. $$$$$ Unfortunately, as a field we have not yet come to agreement about how to show reliability of judgments.

(Cohen, 1960, introduced to computational linguistics by Carletta, 1996) and pi (Scott, 1955). $$$$$ We discuss what is wrong with reliability measures as they are currently used for discourse and dialogue work in computational linguistics and cognitive science, and argue that we would be better off as afield adopting techniques from content analysis.

The reliability of the annotation was evaluated using the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ Assessing Agreement On Classification Tasks

(Carletta 1996) is another method of comparing inter-annotator agreement. $$$$$ Comparing naive and expert coding as KID do can be a useful exercise, but rather than assessing the naive coders' accuracy, it in fact measures how well the instructions convey what these researchers think they do.
(Carletta 1996) is another method of comparing inter-annotator agreement. $$$$$ In Passonneau and Litman, the reason for comparing to the majority opinion is less clear.

We measured inter-annotator agreement with the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) using the 1,391 items that two annotators scored in common. $$$$$ Assessing Agreement On Classification Tasks

To measure inter-annotator agreement, we compute Cohen's Kappa (Carletta, 1996) from the two sets of annotations. $$$$$ Measure (3) still falls foul of the same problem with expected chance agreement as measure (2) because it does not take into account the number of categories occurring in the coding scheme.
To measure inter-annotator agreement, we compute Cohen's Kappa (Carletta, 1996) from the two sets of annotations. $$$$$ In assessing the amount of agreement among coders of category distinctions, the kappa statistic normalizes for the amount of expected chance agreement and allows a single measure to be calculated over multiple coders.

Obtained percent agreement of 0.988 and coefficient (Carletta, 1996) of 0.975 suggest high convergence of both annotations. $$$$$ One would expect measure (1)'s results to be high under any circumstances, and it is not affected by the density of boundaries.
Obtained percent agreement of 0.988 and coefficient (Carletta, 1996) of 0.975 suggest high convergence of both annotations. $$$$$ We suggest that this measure be adopted more widely within our own research community.

P (A) is the observed agreement between annotators and P (E) is the probability of agreement due to chance (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ When there is no agreement other than that which would be expected by chance, K is zero.

Annotation was highly reliable with a kappa (Carletta, 1996) of 3. $$$$$ Currently, computational linguists and cognitive scientists working in the area of discourse and dialogue argue that their subjective judgments are reliable using several different statistics, none of which are easily interpretable or comparable to each other.
Annotation was highly reliable with a kappa (Carletta, 1996) of 3. $$$$$ Silverman et al. treat all coders indistinguishably, although they do build an interesting argument about how agreement levels shift when a number of less-experienced transcribers are added to a pool of highly experienced ones.

With the help of the kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) proposes to represent the dialog success independently from the task intrinsic complexity, thus opening the way to task generic comparative evaluation. $$$$$ The concerns of these researchers are largely the same as those in the field of content analysis (see especially Krippendorff [1980] and Weber [1985]), which has been through the same problems as we are currently facing and in which strong arguments have been made for using the kappa coefficient of agreement (Siegel and Castellan 1988) as a measure of reliability!
With the help of the kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996) proposes to represent the dialog success independently from the task intrinsic complexity, thus opening the way to task generic comparative evaluation. $$$$$ Whether we have reached (or will be able to reach) a reasonable level of agreement in our work as a field remains to be seen; our point here is merely that if, as a community, we adopt clearer statistics, we will be able to compare results in a standard way across different coding schemes and experiments and to evaluate current developments—and that will illuminate both our individual results and the way forward.

To test the reliability of the annotation, we first considered the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) which is used extensively in empirical studies of dis course (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ We first explain what effect chance expected agreement has on each of these measures, and then argue that we should adopt the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan 1988) as a uniform measure of reliability.

Inter-annotator agreement was sufficient (κ = 0.77 on average (Carletta, 1996)). $$$$$ At one time, it was considered sufficient when working with such judgments to show examples based on the authors' interpretation (paradigmatically, (Grosz and Sidner [1986], but also countless others).
Inter-annotator agreement was sufficient (κ = 0.77 on average (Carletta, 1996)). $$$$$ If there are two categories occurring in equal proportions, on average the coders would agree with each other half of the time

In addition to raw inter-tagger agreement, the kappa statistic, which removes from the agreement rate the amount of agreement that is expected by chance (Carletta, 1996), was also determined. $$$$$ When there is no agreement other than that which would be expected by chance, K is zero.

Following the suggestions in (Carletta, 1996), Core et al. consider kappa scores above 0.67 to indicate significant agreement and scores above 0.8 reliable agreement. $$$$$ For instance, consider the following arguments for reliability.
Following the suggestions in (Carletta, 1996), Core et al. consider kappa scores above 0.67 to indicate significant agreement and scores above 0.8 reliable agreement. $$$$$ KID make no comment about the meaning of their figures other than to say that the amount of agreement they show is reasonable; Silverman et al. simply point out that where figures are calculated over different numbers of categories, they are not comparable.

In order to test the reliability of our annotation, we double coded about 18% of the data, namely 21 sub-dialogues comprising 213 pronouns, on which we computed the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ The concerns of these researchers are largely the same as those in the field of content analysis (see especially Krippendorff [1980] and Weber [1985]), which has been through the same problems as we are currently facing and in which strong arguments have been made for using the kappa coefficient of agreement (Siegel and Castellan 1988) as a measure of reliability!

As reported elsewhere the resulting Kappa statistics (Carletta, 1996) over the annotated data yields 0.7. $$$$$ Currently, computational linguists and cognitive scientists working in the area of discourse and dialogue argue that their subjective judgments are reliable using several different statistics, none of which are easily interpretable or comparable to each other.

Since co-reference is a clustering task, any general-purpose method for evaluating a response partition against a key partition (e.g., Kappa (Carletta, 1996)) can be used for coreference scoring (see Popescu-Belis et al (2004)). $$$$$ KID make no comment about the meaning of their figures other than to say that the amount of agreement they show is reasonable; Silverman et al. simply point out that where figures are calculated over different numbers of categories, they are not comparable.

The reliability for the two annotation tasks (statistics (Carletta, 1996)) was of 0.94 and 0.90 respectively. $$$$$ Assessing Agreement On Classification Tasks

From the first effort an inter-annotator agreement (Carletta, 1996) of 0.89 for Cohen's kappa was obtained. $$$$$ Assessing Agreement On Classification Tasks
