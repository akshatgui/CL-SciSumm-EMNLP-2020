Computational approaches are mostly concerned with inferring implicitly expressed metonymic relations in English texts (Fass 1991). $$$$$ Among computational approaches, Indurkhya's (1988) Constrained Semantic Transference theory of metaphor can be viewed as a formalization of Black's interaction theory (ibid., p. 129).

In his program, (Fass 1991) makes use of formal definitions of several kinds of metonymic relations. $$$$$ In CS, seven kinds of semantic relation are distinguished

Our view of relations in a concept network being the interpretations of metonymies is strongly reminiscent of older work in metonymy resolution such as Hobbs et al1993), Fass (1991), Markert and Hahn (2002) or the use of a generative lexicon. $$$$$ Sentences (4), (5) and (6) also have twin interpretations.

Fass (Fass, 1991) uses selectional preference violation technique to detect metaphors. $$$$$ The contextual constraint violation may be a preference violation, as in the selection restrictions view of metaphor.

Wilks (1978) advocates that the typically hard constraints that define a literal semantics should instead be modeled as soft preferences that can accommodate the violations that arise in metaphoric utterances, while Fass (1991) builds on this view to show how these violation scan be repaired to thus capture the literal intent be hind each metaphor. $$$$$ The theory of metaphor in Preference Semantics (Wilks 1975; 1978) consists of a selection restrictions view and a comparison view.

One of the first attempts to identify and interpret metaphorical expressions in text automatically is the approach of Fass (1991). $$$$$ What is crucial in the comparison approach, then, is finding the correct ground in a metaphor.

Another system ,met* (Fass, 1991), is designed to distinguish both metaphor and metonymy from literal text, providing special techniques for processing these instances of figurative language. $$$$$ Metaphor and metonymy are kinds of figurative language or tropes.

For example, 'the rock is becoming brittle with age' (Reddy, 1969, p. 242), has "a literal interpretation when uttered about a stone and a metaphorical one when said about a decrepit professor emeritus" (Fass, 1991, p. 54). $$$$$ The main problem with the selection restrictions view is that perfectly well-formed sentences exist that have a metaphorical interpretation and yet contain no selection restriction violations (Johnson 1980; Ortony 1980; Reddy 1969); for example, in (3), there is a literal interpretation when uttered about a stone and a metaphorical one when said about a decrepit professor emeritus.

A similar path-finding methodology for deriving metonymies was used by the met* system (Fass, 1991), in which connections between the sense frames of textual concepts are retrieved from a lexicon of the size of 500 word senses. $$$$$ All the terms in sense-frames are word senses with their own sense-frames or words used in a particular sense that could be replaced by word senses.
