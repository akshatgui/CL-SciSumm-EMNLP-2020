Details of the mention detection and coreference system can be found in (Florian et al, 2004). $$$$$ The Entity Detection and Tracking task (EDT henceforth) has close ties to the named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution tasks, which have been the focus of attention of much investigation in the recent past (Bikel et al., 1997; Borthwick et al., 1998; Mikheev et al., 1999; Miller et al., 1998; Aberdeen et al., 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al., 2001), and have been at the center of several evaluations

However, Florian et al (2006) used some gazetteers and the output of other Information Extraction (IE) models as additional features, which provided significant gains ((Florian et al, 2004)). $$$$$ Hence, we used the output of these pre-existing taggers and used them as additional feature streams for the mention detection models.

We use an information extraction toolkit (Florian et al, 2004) to analyze each event argument. $$$$$ (Zhang et al., 2002).
We use an information extraction toolkit (Florian et al, 2004) to analyze each event argument. $$$$$ Good performance in many natural language processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing and named entity recognition, has been shown to depend heavily on integrating many sources of information (Zhang et al., 2002; Jing et al., 2003; Ittycheriah et al., 2003).

In the case when some in-domain labeled training data is available, we show how to use SCL together with the classifier combination techniques of Florian et al (2004) to achieve even greater performance. $$$$$ We selected two methods which satisfy these criteria

In this case, we use classifiers as features as described in Florian et al (2004). $$$$$ (Zhang et al., 2002).
In this case, we use classifiers as features as described in Florian et al (2004). $$$$$ As described in Section 2.6, the mention detection systems make use of a large set of features.

In this case, we make use of the out-of-domain data by using features of the source domain tagger's predictions in training and testing the target domain tagger (Florian et al, 2004). $$$$$ For instance, a pre-existing tagger may identify dates or occupation mentions (not used in ACE), among other types.

Aside from Florian et al (2004), several authors have also given techniques for adapting classification to new domains. $$$$$ (Zhang et al., 2002).
Aside from Florian et al (2004), several authors have also given techniques for adapting classification to new domains. $$$$$ Both methods can integrate arbitrary types of information and make a classification decision by aggregating all information available for a given classification.

This is because, similar to many NLP tasks, good performance has been shown to depend heavily on integrating many sources of information (Florian et al, 2004). $$$$$ The Entity Detection and Tracking task (EDT henceforth) has close ties to the named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution tasks, which have been the focus of attention of much investigation in the recent past (Bikel et al., 1997; Borthwick et al., 1998; Mikheev et al., 1999; Miller et al., 1998; Aberdeen et al., 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al., 2001), and have been at the center of several evaluations

Initially, the corpus is automatically annotated with NE types in the source and target languages using NE identifiers similar to the systems described in (Florian et al, 2004) for NE detection. $$$$$ This approach allows the system to automatically correlate the (different) mention types to the desired output.

In addition, feature-based integration has been used by Taskar et al (2005), who trained a discriminative word alignment model using features derived from the IBM models, and by Florian et al (2004), who trained classifiers on auxiliary data to guide named entity classifiers. $$$$$ In addition, the mention detection model crucially uses feature streams derived from different named entity classifiers.

These features were described in (Florian et al, 2004), and are not discussed here. $$$$$ The Entity Detection and Tracking task (EDT henceforth) has close ties to the named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution tasks, which have been the focus of attention of much investigation in the recent past (Bikel et al., 1997; Borthwick et al., 1998; Mikheev et al., 1999; Miller et al., 1998; Aberdeen et al., 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al., 2001), and have been at the center of several evaluations

We also note that while Florian et al (2004) and Blitzer et al (2006) observe that including the label of a source classifier as a feature on small amounts of target data tends to improve over using either the source alone or the target alone, we did not observe that for our data. $$$$$ The Entity Detection and Tracking task (EDT henceforth) has close ties to the named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution tasks, which have been the focus of attention of much investigation in the recent past (Bikel et al., 1997; Borthwick et al., 1998; Mikheev et al., 1999; Miller et al., 1998; Aberdeen et al., 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al., 2001), and have been at the center of several evaluations
