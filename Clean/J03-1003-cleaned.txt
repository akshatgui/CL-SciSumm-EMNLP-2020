Identifying sets of objects originally followed the incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995), as in (Bateman 1999), (Stone 2000) and (Krahmer et al 2003), with limited coverage, since only few attributes typically apply to all intended referents and to none of the potential distractors. $$$$$ The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades, including Appelt (1985), Reiter (1990), Dale and Haddock (1991), Dale (1992), Dale and Reiter (1995), Horacek (1997), Stone and Webber (1998), Krahmer and Theune (1998, 2002), Bateman (1999), and van Deemter (2000, 2002).

(in line with the human preference for basic level values; cf. Krahmer et al 2003. $$$$$ According to Dale and Reiter (1995) and Reiter (1990), human speakers have a general preference for basic level values and move to more specific (subsumed) values only if these are more informative.
(in line with the human preference for basic level values; cf. Krahmer et al 2003. $$$$$ For a given attribute, the basic level edges should be assigned the lowest costs, and those farthest away from the basic level edge should have the highest costs.

We are currently exploring whether Krahmer et als (2003) graph-based approach to GRE is able to provide a better coverage of the data $$$$$ We propose to formalize a scene (i.e., a domain of objects and their properties and relations) as a labeled directed graph and describe the content selection problem (which properties and relations to include in a description for an object?) as a subgraph construction problem.

The major exceptions here may be (a) van Deemter's (2002) algorithm for sets; recall that we excluded from the human data used here 16 references that involved sets; and, as noted above, (b) Krahmer et als (2003) graph-based approach to GRE, which may perform better than the Relational Algorithm on descriptions using relations. $$$$$ In addition, many algorithms still have difficulties with the generation of relational descriptions (descriptions that include references to other objects to single out the target object from its distractors).

They distinguish three types of preciseness, i.e. precise, imprecise, or very imprecise pointing, and integrate pointing into the graph-based algorithm proposed by [Krahmer et al, 2003]. $$$$$ It is worth pointing out that there are various alternatives to full subgraph isomorphism that have a lower complexity.

Algorithms for the generation of referring expressions commonly use this as a starting point, proposing that properties are organized in some linear order (Dale and Reiter, 1995) or weighted order (Krahmer et al, 2003) as input. $$$$$ Graph-Based Generation Of Referring Expressions
Algorithms for the generation of referring expressions commonly use this as a starting point, proposing that properties are organized in some linear order (Dale and Reiter, 1995) or weighted order (Krahmer et al, 2003) as input. $$$$$ In what is probably the key reference on the topic, Dale and Reiter (1995) describe and discuss a number of algorithms for the generation of referring expressions.

Similarly, one of the strengths of the Graph-Based Algorithm (Krahmer et al, 2003) is its ability to generate expressions that involve relations between objects, and these include spatial ones (next to, on top of, etc.). $$$$$ Graph-Based Generation Of Referring Expressions
Similarly, one of the strengths of the Graph-Based Algorithm (Krahmer et al, 2003) is its ability to generate expressions that involve relations between objects, and these include spatial ones (next to, on top of, etc.). $$$$$ For instance, the generation of relational expressions (i.e., referring expressions that include references to other objects) is enhanced by the fact that both properties and relations are formalized in the same way, namely, as edges in a graph.

In addition, we plan to experiment with assigning costs to planning operators in a metric planning problem (Hoffmann, 2002) in order to model the cognitive cost of an RE (Krahmer et al, 2003) and compute minimal-cost instruction sequences. $$$$$ Thus, for each v E VH and for each e E EH

(Krahmer et al, 2003) describe an approach to GRE in which a cost function guides search for a suitable description, and show that some existing GRE algorithms fit into this framework. $$$$$ In addition, the user has the possibility of specifying the cost function in whatever way he or she sees fit.

Recent work has formalised NLG algorithms for referring expression generation in terms of algorithms for finding an appropriate subgraph of a graph representing the domain knowledge [Krahmer et al, 2003]. $$$$$ It is unclear how such statistical work on generation can be combined with older, rule-based work such as the algorithms just discussed.
Recent work has formalised NLG algorithms for referring expression generation in terms of algorithms for finding an appropriate subgraph of a graph representing the domain knowledge [Krahmer et al, 2003]. $$$$$ The problem of finding a referring expression for an object is treated as finding a subgraph of the scene graph that is isomorphic to the intended referent but not to any other object.

The Graph based algorithm (Krahmer et al, 2003), for example, searches for the cheapest description for a target, and distinguishes cheap attributes (such as color) from more expensive ones (orientation). $$$$$ If that does not suffice, first absolute attributes like color are tried, followed by relative ones such as size.

Although Krahmer et al claim that their method can handle n-ary relations (Krahmer et al, 2003), they provide node tails. $$$$$ Moreover, the approach is fully general and applies to n-ary relations (and relation/property combinations) as well.

A possible direction would be to enhance the algorithm proposed by Krahmer et al (Krahmer et al., 2003). $$$$$ First, we assign salience weights to the vertices in the scene graph using the salience weights definition proposed by Krahmer and Theune.
A possible direction would be to enhance the algorithm proposed by Krahmer et al (Krahmer et al., 2003). $$$$$ For example, Bauckhage et al. (1999) describe an assembly system in which computer vision is used to convert a workspace with various building blocks into a labeled directed scene graph.

The graph-based REG algorithm (Krahmer et al, 2003), for example, models preferences in terms of costs, where cheaper is more preferred. $$$$$ First, the list of preferred attributes can be modeled in terms of the cost function

In the graph-based algorithm (Krahmer et al, 2003), which we refer to as Graph, information about domain objects is represented as a labelled directed graph, and REG is modeled as a graph-search problem. $$$$$ Graph (i) refers to all vertices of the graph in Figure 3 (every object in the scene is next to some other object), graph (ii) can refer to both d1 and d2, and graph (iii) is distinguishing in that it can refer only to d1.
