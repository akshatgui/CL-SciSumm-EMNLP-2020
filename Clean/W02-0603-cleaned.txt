We previously presented two segmentation algorithms suitable for agglutinative languages (Creutz and Lagus, 2002). $$$$$ This model is especially suitable for languages with agglutinative morphological structure.
We previously presented two segmentation algorithms suitable for agglutinative languages (Creutz and Lagus, 2002). $$$$$ This is likely to be partially due to the model structure of the presented methods which is especially suitable for languages such as Finnish.

A Poisson distribution can be justified and has been used in order to model the length distribution of word and morph tokens [e.g., (Creutz and Lagus, 2002)], but for morph types we have chosen the gamma distribution, which has a thicker tail. $$$$$ Let M be the morph codebook (the vocabulary of morph types) and D = m1m2 ... mn the sequence of morph tokens that makes up the string of words.

The search for the optimal model given our input data corresponds closely to the recursive segmentation algorithm presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002). $$$$$ The Viterbi algorithm is used for searching for the optimal segmentation given a model.

We utilize an evaluation method for segmentation of words presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002). $$$$$ However, the linguistic evaluation is in general not so straightforward.

For highly inflecting languages more generally, morphological analysis is often treated as a segment and-normalise problem, amenable to analysis by weighted finite state transducer (wFST), for example, Creutz and Lagus (2002) for Finnish. $$$$$ D´ejean (1998) concentrates on the problem of finding the list of frequent affixes for a language rather than attempting to produce a morphological analysis of each word.

Creutz and Lagus (2002) proposed two unsupervised methods for word segmentation, one based on maximum description length, and one based on maximum likelihood. $$$$$ The first method is based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and works online.

Finnish is also the language for which the algorithm for the unsupervised morpheme discovery (Creutz and Lagus, 2002) was originally developed. $$$$$ Unsupervised Discovery Of Morphemes
Finnish is also the language for which the algorithm for the unsupervised morpheme discovery (Creutz and Lagus, 2002) was originally developed. $$$$$ If effective methods can be devised for the unsupervised discovery of morphemes, they could aid the formulation of a linguistic theory of morphology for a new language.

Similarly, Creutz and Lagus (2002) use an MDL formulation for word segmentation. $$$$$ In this case, we use as cost function the likelihood of the data, i.e., P(data
