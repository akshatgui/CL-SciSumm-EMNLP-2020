This is the same sort of preference that is addressed by property-sharing constraint (Kameyama, 1986). $$$$$ This property-sharing constraint requires that two pronominal expressions that retain the same Cb across adjacent utterances share a certain common grammatical property.

Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ A constraint is proposed in the Centering approach to pronoun resolution in discourse.
Kameyama (1986) proposed a fourth transition type, Center Establishment (EST), for utterances E.g., in Bruno was the bully of the neighborhood. $$$$$ Accounting for the effect of parallelism in Cb-establishment The given property-sharing constraint has so far been proposed for pronominal elements that retain the same Cb in adjacent utterances.

In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context. $$$$$ One of them is the use of pronominal expressions, as expressed in the
In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context. $$$$$ I will use the words retain and continue in non-technical sense in this paper.

Kameyama (1986) emphasized the importance of a property-sharing constraint. $$$$$ This property-sharing constraint requires that two pronominal expressions that retain the same Cb across adjacent utterances share a certain common grammatical property.

 $$$$$ Then I will propose an additional dimension of the shared property called the &quot;speaker identification&quot; property.
 $$$$$ I have also greatly profited from discussions with Aravind Joshi and comments on an earlier version by N. Abe, M. Papalaskari, R. Rubinoff, J. Smudski, and

There are two versions of the centering theory that have been applied to Japanese zero pronoun resolution $$$$$ The basic Centering rule in Japanese can be obtained by changing the word pronoun to zero pronominal in (1) (Kameyama 1985).
There are two versions of the centering theory that have been applied to Japanese zero pronoun resolution $$$$$ 13The importance of SUBJECT in centering is also discussed in Grosz et. al.
