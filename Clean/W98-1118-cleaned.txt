A wide variety of machine learning methods have been applied to this problem, including Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al 1997), Maximum Entropy methods (Borthwick et al 1998, Chieu and Ng 2002), Decision Trees (Sekine et al 1998), Conditional Random Fields (McCallum and Li 2003), Class-based Language Model (Sun et al 2002), Agent-based Approach (Ye et al 2002) and Support Vector Machines. $$$$$ This approach is essentially the same as (Sekine et al., 1998).

Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997), named entity recognition (Borthwick et al, 1998), partial parsing (Inui and Inui, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002) and question answering (Chu-Carroll et al, 2003). $$$$$ M.E. was first applied to named entity recognition at the MUC-7 conference by (Borthwick et al., 1998) and (Mikheev and Grover, 1998).

For instance, maximum entropy may be used when a high diversity of knowledge sources are to be taken into account (Borthwick et al, 1998). $$$$$ Exploiting Diverse Knowledge Sources Via Maximum Entropy In Named Entity Recognition
For instance, maximum entropy may be used when a high diversity of knowledge sources are to be taken into account (Borthwick et al, 1998). $$$$$ More MENE test results and discussion of the formal run can be found in (Borthwick et al., 1998).

It is straightforward to see that this problem may be resolved using dynamic programming, as did Borthwick et al (1998). $$$$$ More MENE test results and discussion of the formal run can be found in (Borthwick et al., 1998).
