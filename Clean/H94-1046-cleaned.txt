First, the similarity and relatedness measures used in the system may rely on SemCor data (Miller et al., 1994). $$$$$ This similarity can be attributed to the limited size of the semantic oncordance: no co-occurrence data were available for 28% of the polysemous words, so the most-frequent heuristic had to he used; moreover, those words for which co-occurrence data were available tended to occur in their most frequent senses.

The sense-tagged corpus SEMCOR, prepared by (Miller et al, 1994), contains a substantial subset of the Brown corpus tagged with the refined senses of WORDNET. $$$$$ If the syntactically tagged word (word/pos) has more than one sense in WordNet, consult the semantic concordance to determine which sense occurred most often in that corpus and assign that sense to it; if there is a fie, select one of the equally frequent senses at random.

However, as reported in (Miller et al, 1994), there are not enough training examples per word in SP. $$$$$ If the word has more than one sense in WordNet, con- suit the semantic co-occurrence matrix to determine what senses of the word co-occur in the training material with other words in the test sentence.

It is a balanced corpus and it has more than 200K words that are manually sense tagged as a product of the semantic concordance (SemCor) effort using WordNet [Miller et al 1994]. $$$$$ At the ARPA Human Language Technology Workshop in March 1993, Miller, Leacock, Tengi, and Bunker [7] described a semantic concordance that combines passages from the Brown Corpus [3] with the WordNet lexical d~t_~base [2] in such a way that every open-class word in the text (every noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) carries both a syntactic tag and a semantic tag pointing to the appropriate sense of that word in WordNet.

(Miller et al, 1994) found that automatic assignment of polysemous words in Brown Corpus to senses in WordNet was 58% correct with a heuristic of most frequently occurring sense. $$$$$ When statistics for sense- frequancies were derived from a semantic concordance, the assumption that each word is used in its most frequently occurring sense was correct 69% of the time; when that figure was calculated for polysemous words alone, it dropped to 58%.
