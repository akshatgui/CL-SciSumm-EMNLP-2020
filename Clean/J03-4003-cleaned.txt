Reranking of n-best lists has recently become popular in several natural language problems, including parsing (Collins, 2003), machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002) and web search (Joachims, 2002). $$$$$ This article describes three statistical models for natural language parsing.

All the COL03 systems are results obtained using the restriction of the output of Collins (2003) parser. $$$$$ In Model 2, we extend the parser to make the complement/adjunct distinction, which will be important for most applications using the output from the parser.
All the COL03 systems are results obtained using the restriction of the output of Collins (2003) parser. $$$$$ The results are given below.

My guess is that the features used in e.g., the Collins (2003) or Charniak (2000) parsers are probably close to optimal for English Penn Treebank parsing (Marcus et al, 1993), but that other features might improve parsing of other languages or even other English genres. $$$$$ Two models (Collins 2000; Charniak 2000) outperform models 2 and 3 on section 23 of the treebank.

The corpora are first parsed using Collins's parser (Collins, 2003) with the boundaries of all the entity mentions kept. $$$$$ In Model 2, we extend the parser to make the complement/adjunct distinction, which will be important for most applications using the output from the parser.
The corpora are first parsed using Collins's parser (Collins, 2003) with the boundaries of all the entity mentions kept. $$$$$ Section 0 of the treebank was parsed with models 1 and 2 as before, but the parse trees were restricted to include rules already seen in training data.

To generate parse trees, we use the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al, 2006), and use Collins head rules (Collins, 2003) to head-out binarize each tree. $$$$$ In the three models a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree.

As pointed out by an anonymous reviewer of Collins (2003), removing outermost punctuation might discard useful information. $$$$$ 13 As one of the anonymous reviewers of this article pointed out, this choice of discarding the sentence-final punctuation may not be optimal, as the final punctuation mark may well carry useful information about the sentence structure.

We suspect that identities of punctuation marks (Collins, 2003, Footnote 13) - both sentence-final and sentence-initial - could be of extra assistance in grammar induction, specifically for grouping imperatives, questions, and so forth. $$$$$ Each derivation corresponds to a tree-sentence pair that is well formed under the grammar.

The first, proposed by (Johnson, 1998), is the annotation of parental history, and the second encodes a head-outward generation process (Collins, 2003). $$$$$ Note that the first item of the conjunct is taken as the head of the phrase. process, namely, the generation of the coordinator tag/word pair, parameterized by the P,, parameter.

Collins (2003) proposes to generate the head of a phrase first and then generate its sisters using Markovian processes, thereby exploiting head/sister-dependencies. $$$$$ In particular, the model in Collins (1997) failed to generate punctuation, a deficiency of the model.

This dimension is orthogonal to the vertical (Collins, 2003) and horizontal (Johnson, 1998) dimensions previously outlined by Klein and Manning (2003), and it can not be collapsed into any one of the previous two. $$$$$ Similar observations have been made in the context of tagging problems using maximum-entropy models (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001; Klein and Manning 2002).

(1994), and Magerman (1995) can suffer from very similar problems to the “label bias” or “observation bias” problem observed in tagging models, as described in Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira (2001) and Klein and Manning (2002).

Even when the breakdown for particular node types is presented (e.g. Collins, 2003), the interaction between node errors is not taken into account. $$$$$ We also give a breakdown of precision and recall results in recovering various types of dependencies.

Inspired by the work of Collins (2003), the generative model builds trees by recursively creating nodes at each level according to a Markov process. $$$$$ In this case the verb is “invisible” to the top level, as it is generated recursively below the NP object.

Motivated by Collins syntactic parsing models (Collins, 2003), we consider the generation process for a hybrid sequence from an MR production as a Markov process. $$$$$ Seneff (1992) describes the use of Markov models for rule generation, which is closely related to the Markov-style rules in the models in the current article.
