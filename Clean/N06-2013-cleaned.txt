Furthermore, it is not necessarily optimal in that (i) manually engineered segmentation schemes can outperform a straightforward linguistic morphological segmentation, e.g., (Habash and Sadat, 2006), and (ii) it may result in even worse performance than a word-based system, e.g., (Durgar El-Kahlout and Oflazer, 2006). $$$$$ We use the phrase-based SMT system, Portage (Sadat et al., 2005).

Habash and Sadat (2006) perform morphological decomposition of Arabic words, such as splitting of prefixes and suffixes. $$$$$ It is limited to splitting off punctuations and numbers from words and removing any diacritics that appear in the input.

More aggressive segmentation results in fewer OOV tokens, but automatic evaluation metrics indicate lower translation quality, presumably because the smaller units are being translated less idiomatically (Habash and Sadat, 2006). $$$$$ The anecdotal intuition in the field is that reduction of word sparsity often improves translation quality.

A morphological analysis of the Arabic text is then done using the Arabic morphological analyzer and disambiguation tool MADA (Nizar Habash and Roth, 2009), with the MADA-D2 since it seems to be the most efficient scheme for large data (Habash and Sadat, 2006). $$$$$ However, for small amounts of training data, it is best to apply English-like tokenization using part-of-speech tags, and sophisticated morphological analysis and disambiguation.
