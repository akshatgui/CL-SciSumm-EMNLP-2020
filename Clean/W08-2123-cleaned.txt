One is gold-standard syntactic input, and other two are based on automatically parsing results of two parsers, the state-of-the-art syntactic parser described in (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) 7 (it is referred to Johansson) and an integrated parser described as the following (referred to MST ME). $$$$$ Rather than training the models on gold- standard syntactic input, we created an automati- cally parsed training set by 5-fold cross-validation.

The comparison indicates that our integrated system outputs a result quite close to the state-of-the-art by the pipeline system of (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) as the same syntactic structure input is adopted. $$$$$ CoNLL 2008

It is worth noting that our system actually competes with two independent sub-systems of (Johansson and Nugues, 2008), one for verbal predicates, the other for nominal predicates. $$$$$ We trained one set of classifiers for verb predicates and another for noun predicates.

Semantic role classifiers rely heavily on lexical features (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b), and this may lead to brittleness; in order to increase robustness, we added features based on hierarchical clusters constructed using the Brown algorithm (Brown et al, 1992). $$$$$ All classifiers in the pipeline were L2-regularized linear logistic regres- sion classifiers, implemented using the efficient LIBLINEAR package (Lin et al., 2008).

SRL based on FrameNet is thus not a novel task, although very few systems are known capable of completing a general frame-based annotation process over raw texts, noticeable exceptions being discussed for example in (Erk and Pado, 2006), (Johansson and Nugues, 2008b) and (Coppola et al., 2009). $$$$$ A widely used framework for fitting the weight vector is the max-margin model (Taskar et al., 2003), which is a generalization of the well- known support vector machines to general cost- based prediction problems.
