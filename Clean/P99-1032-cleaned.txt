Specifically, each sentence was assigned a subjective or objective classitication, according to concensus lags derived by a stalistical analysis of the chisses assigned by three human judges (see (Wiebe et al, 1999) for further information). $$$$$ As applied here, the observed variables are the classifications assigned by the judges.

Other approaches to annotator quality control include using EM-based algorithms for estimating annotator bias (Wiebe et al 1999, Ipeirotis et al 2010). $$$$$ Goodman's procedure is a specialization of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), which is implemented in the freeware program CoCo (Badsberg, 1995).

Wiebe et al (1999) classified sentence level subjectivity using syntactic classes such as adjectives, pronouns and modal verbs as features. $$$$$ However, the object of the sentence is not presented as material that is factual to the reporter, so the sentence is classified as subjective.

We followed (Wiebe et al, 1999) in rationalizing the subjective vs. the objective categories. $$$$$ Such sentences may be either subjective or objective.

Our experimental results show that the subjectivity classifier performs well (77% recall with 81% precision) and that the learned nouns improve upon previous state-of-the-art subjectivity results (Wiebe et al, 1999). $$$$$ We also present the results of a probabilistic classifier developed on the resulting annotations.

Row (2) is a Naive Bayes classifier that uses the WBO features, which performed well in prior research on sentence-level subjectivity classification (Wiebe et al, 1999). $$$$$ In the method we use for developing classifiers (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), a search is performed to find a probability model that captures important interdependencies among features.

In contrast, our work classifies individual sentences, as does the research in (Wiebe et al, 1999). $$$$$ Let nj denote the number of sentences that judge 1 classifies as i and judge 2 classifies as j, and let be the probability that a randomly selected sentence is categorized as i by judge 1 and j by judge 2.

Bruc eand Wiebe (1999) annotated 1,001 sentences as subjective or objective, and Wiebe et al (1999) described a sentence-level Naive Bayes classifier using as features the presence or absence of particular syntactic classes (pronouns, adjectives, cardinal numbers, modal verbs, adverbs), punctuation, and sentence position. $$$$$ A binary feature is included for each of the following

While words and n-grams had little performance effect for the opinion class, they increased the recall for the fact class around five fold compared to the approach by Wiebe et al (1999). $$$$$ Then, the latent class model is

Following (Wiebe et al, 1999), if the primary goal of a sentence is judged as the objective reporting of information, it was labeled as OBJ. $$$$$ The definitions of the categories in our coding manual are intention-based

Again, our feature set is richer than Wiebe et al (1999). $$$$$ Thus, it is used to define the bias-corrected tags for the second data set as well.

Previous work on sentence-level subjectivity classification (Wiebe et al, 1999) used training corpora that had been manually annotated for subjectivity. $$$$$ In related work (Wiebe et al., in preparation), we found that article types, such as announcement and opinion piece, are significantly correlated with the subjective and objective classification.

 $$$$$ We are grateful to Matthew T. Bell and Richard A. Wiebe for participating in the annotation study, and to the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

According to the coding manual (Wiebe et al, 1999), subjective sentences are those expressing evaluations, opinions, emotions, and speculations. $$$$$ From the coding manual

One judge annotated all articles in four datasets of the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus (Marcus et al, 1993) (W9-4, W9-10, W9-22, and W9 33, each approximately 160K words) as well as the corpus of Wall Street Journal articles used in (Wiebe et al, 1999) (called WSJ-SE below). $$$$$ A second corpus is annotated by the same four judges according to the new coding manual.

Additionally, it may be possible to refine the classications automatically using methods such as those described in (Wiebe et al, 1999). $$$$$ This model can be evaluated using CoCo as described on pages 289-290 of Bishop et al. (1975).
Additionally, it may be possible to refine the classications automatically using methods such as those described in (Wiebe et al, 1999). $$$$$ The results of the second tagging experiment are analyzed using the methods described in section 3, and bias-corrected tags are produced for the second data set.

During the past few years, the problem of polarity recognition has been usually faced as a step beyond the identification of the subjectivity or objectivity of texts (Wiebe et al, 1999). $$$$$ Linguistic categorizations usually do not cover all instances perfectly.
