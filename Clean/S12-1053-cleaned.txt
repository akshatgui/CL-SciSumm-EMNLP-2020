Recently, a new dataset including "Unknown" pairs has been used in the "Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchronization" task at SemEval-2012 (Negri et al, 2012). $$$$$ Semeval-2012 Task 8

 $$$$$ Accuracy results are reported in Table 3.
 $$$$$ The authors would also like to acknowledge Giovanni Moretti from CELCT for evaluation scripts and technical assistance, and the volunteer translators that contributed to the creation of the dataset

For a comprehensive description of the task see (Negri et al, 2012). $$$$$ FBK [cross lingual, compositional & multiclass] (Mehdad et al., 2012a) uses cross-lingual matching features extracted from lexical phrase tables, semantic phrase tables, and dependency relations (Mehdad et al., 2011; Mehdad et al., 2012b; Mehdad et al., 2012c).
For a comprehensive description of the task see (Negri et al, 2012). $$$$$ ICT [pivoting, compositional] (Meng et al., 2012) adopts a pivoting method (using Google Translate and an in-house hierarchical MT system), and the open source EDITS system (Kouylekov and Negri, 2010) to calculate similarity scores between monolingual English pairs.

Spanish data sets provided in the task 8 of SemEval 2012 (Negri et al, 2012). $$$$$ Semeval-2012 Task 8

The SemEval-2012 CLTE task (Negri et al, 2012) asks participants to judge entailment pairs in four language combinations, defining four target entailment relations, for ward, backward, bidirectional and no entailment. $$$$$ Semeval-2012 Task 8

Cross-Lingual Text Entailment (CLTE), besides introducing the extra dimension of cross-linguality, also requires to determine the exact direction of the entailment relation, to provide content synchronization (Negri et al, 2012). $$$$$ Semeval-2012 Task 8

In this paper we have presented the DirRelCond3 systems that participated at the CLTE task (Negri et al., 2012) from SemEval-2012. $$$$$ Semeval-2012 Task 8
