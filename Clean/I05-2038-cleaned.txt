We first converted the gold standard annotation of the GENIA treebank (Tateisi et al, 2005) into a dependency representation using the Stanford parser tools (de Marneffe et al, 2006) and then determined the shortest paths in the dependency analyses connecting each relevant entity with each NE. $$$$$ We have made the ?gold standard?
