The only recipe that is implicitly given in the large literature on parsing to date is to have human annotators build parse trees for a sample set from the domain of interest, and consequently use them to compute a PARSEVAL (Black et al, 1991) score that is indicative of the intrinsic performance of the parser. $$$$$ Notice that "Number of Standard-Parse Constituents in Candidate" and "Number of Candidate-Parse Constituents in Standard" are merely different names for the same object--the intersection of the set of standard-parse constituents with the set of candidate-parse constituents.

Nevertheless, we agree with the widespread sentiment that dependency-based evaluation of parsers avoids many of the problems of the traditional Parseval measures (Black et al, 1991), and to the extent that the Stanford dependency representation is an effective representation for the tasks envisioned, it is perhaps closer to an appropriate task based evaluation than some of the alternative dependency representations available. $$$$$ We propose an evaluation pro- cedure with these characteristics

In particular, metrics like attachment score for dependency parsers (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) and Parseval for constituency parsers (Black et al, 1991) suffer from being an average over a highly skewed distribution of different grammatical constructions. $$$$$ The average Crossing Parentheses rate over all our grammars was .4%, with a corresponding Recall score of 94%.
