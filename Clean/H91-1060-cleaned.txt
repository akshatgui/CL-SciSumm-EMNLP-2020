We evaluated our parser using the standard PARSEVAL measures (Black et al, 1991): labelled precision, labelled recall, and labelled F-measure (Prec., Rec., and F1, respectively), which are based on the number of non-terminal items in the parser's output that match those in the gold-standard parse. $$$$$ (b) "Recall" and "Precision" of Parse Being Evaluated As a preliminary to computing Recall: Number of Standard-Parse Constituents in Candidate Total Number of Standard-Parse Constituents and Precision: Number of Candidate-Parse Constituents in Standard Total Number of Candidate-Parse Constituents the total number of constituents in the standard parse, and in the candidate parse, are simply counted.

The only recipe that is implicitly given in the large literature on parsing to date is to have human annotators build parse trees for a sample set from the domain of interest, and consequently use them to compute a PARSEVAL (Black et al, 1991) score that is indicative of the intrinsic performance of the parser. $$$$$ Notice that "Number of Standard-Parse Constituents in Candidate" and "Number of Candidate-Parse Constituents in Standard" are merely different names for the same object--the intersection of the set of standard-parse constituents with the set of candidate-parse constituents.

Nevertheless, we agree with the widespread sentiment that dependency-based evaluation of parsers avoids many of the problems of the traditional Parseval measures (Black et al, 1991), and to the extent that the Stanford dependency representation is an effective representation for the tasks envisioned, it is perhaps closer to an appropriate task based evaluation than some of the alternative dependency representations available. $$$$$ We propose an evaluation pro- cedure with these characteristics: it judges a parse based only on the constituent boundaries it stipulates (and not the names it assigns to these constituents); it compares the parse to a "hand-parse" of the same sentence from the University of Pennsylvania Tree- bank; and it yields two principal measures for each parse submitted.
