We used a feature set which included the current, next, and previous word; the previous two tags; various capitalization and other features of the word being tagged (the full feature set is described in (Collins 2002a)). $$$$$ We used the following features (several of the features were inspired by the approach of (Bikel et. al 1999), an HMM model which gives excellent results on named entity extraction)

(Collins 2002a) describes experiments on the same named-entity dataset as in this paper, but using explicit features rather than kernels. $$$$$ This paper describes algorithms which rerank the top N hypotheses from a maximum-entropy tagger, the application being the recovery of named-entity boundaries in a corpus of web data.

The true segmentation can now be compared with the N-best list in order to train an averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002a). $$$$$ The voted perceptron algorithm can be considerably more efficient to train, at some cost in computation on test examples.

However, due to the computational issues with the voted perceptron, the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002a) is used instead. $$$$$ The second approach uses the voted perceptron algorithm.

To reduce the time complexity, we adapted the lazy update proposed in (Collins, 2002b), which was also used in (Zhang and Clark, 2007). $$$$$ This will generate a feature string for each of the entities in a candidate, this time using the values rather than .

For all objectives, we use the same standard set of feature templates, following Kazama and Torisawa (2007) with additional token shape like those in Collins (2002b) and simple gazetteer features. $$$$$ We will use “feature templates” to describe the features that we used.

This approach has been used earlier by (Collins, 2002). $$$$$ Another attractive property of the voted perceptron is that it can be used with kernels, for example the kernels over parse trees described in (Collins and Duffy 2001; Collins and Duffy 2002).

This result is used to explain the convergence of weighted or voted perceptron algorithms (Collins, 2002a). $$$$$ Ranking Algorithms For Named Entity Extraction

Collins (2002) augmented a baseline NE tagger with a re-ranker that used only local, NE-oriented features. $$$$$ As a baseline model we used a maximum entropy tagger, very similar to the ones described in (Ratnaparkhi 1996; Borthwick et.

Each shape replaces characters by their types (case sensitive letters, digits, and punctuation), and deletes repeated types - e.g., Confidence and 2,664,098 are respectively mapped to Aa and 0,0+,0+ (Collins, 2002b). $$$$$ The word with each character mapped to its type, but repeated consecutive character types are not repeated in the mapped string.
