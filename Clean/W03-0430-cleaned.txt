Part of the features we used for our CRF classifier are common features that are widely used in NER (McCallum and Li, 2003), as shown below. $$$$$ Given these modelsâ€™ great flexibility to include a wide array of features, an important question that remains is what features should be used?
Part of the features we used for our CRF classifier are common features that are widely used in NER (McCallum and Li, 2003), as shown below. $$$$$ We start with no features, and over several rounds of feature induction: (1) consider a set of proposed new features, (2) select for inclusion those candidate features that will most increase the log-likelihood of the correct state path s(j), and (3) train weights for all features.
