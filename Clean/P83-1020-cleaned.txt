This model is interesting in that it does not allow the parser to employ delay tactics, such as using a lookahead buffer (Marcus (1980), Marcus et al (1983)), or waiting for the head of a phrase to appear in the input before constructing that phrase (Abney (1987, 1989), Pritehett (1992)). $$$$$ (Marcus 19801, (Church 801 and (Berwick 821).

The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node. $$$$$ These constraints include the following: The Rightmost Daughter Constraint, that only the rightmost daughter of a node can be lowered under a sibling node at any given point in the parsing process; and The No Crossover Constraint, that no node can be lowered under a sibling which is not contiguous to it, and some others.
The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node. $$$$$ If it asserts that D(V, Cl), this violates the Rightmost Daughter Constraint, because only C2 can be lowered under a sibling.

More on Dominance Links Dominance links are quite common in tree description formalisms, where they were already in use in D-theory (Marcus et al, 1983) and in quasi-tree semantics for fb TAGs (Vijay-Shanker, 1992). $$$$$ One final introductory comment: That D-theory expresses syntactic structure in terms of dominance rather than direct dominance may be reminiscent of [Lasnik & Kupin 19771 (henceforth L-K), but our use of the dominance predicate differs fundamentally from the L-K formulation both in the primacy of the predicate to the theory, and in the theory of syntax implied.

S /npvp Mary/ V S th inks /npvp^ John M&C suggest various possibilities for packing the partial syntax trees, including using Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi 1987) or Description Theory (Marcus et al 1983). $$$$$ Rather than constructing a tree, a natural language parser based on these ideas will construct a single description which can be viewed as a partial description of each of a family of trees.
