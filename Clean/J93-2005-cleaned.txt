Pustejovsky confronted with the problem of automatic acquisition more extensively in [Pustejovsky et al 1993]. $$$$$ It is these lexical structures that are then statistically tuned against the corpus, following the methods outlined in Anick and Pustejovsky (1990) and Pustejovsky (1992).
Pustejovsky confronted with the problem of automatic acquisition more extensively in [Pustejovsky et al 1993]. $$$$$ This process and the corpus tuning for both argument typing and subcategorization acquisition are described in Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky (1992) and Pustejovsky et al. (1992).

We inferred the bracketing by modifying an algorithm initially proposed by Pustejovsky et al (1993). $$$$$ We describe research on conversion of a machine-tractable dictionary (Wilks et al. 1993) into a usable lexical knowledge base (Boguraev 1991).

(Pustejovsky et al., 1993) points out that the existing approaches to resolving the ambiguity of noun phrases fall roughly into two camps: adjacency and dependency. $$$$$ This process and the corpus tuning for both argument typing and subcategorization acquisition are described in Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky (1992) and Pustejovsky et al.

(Pustejovsky et al., 1993) points out that the existing approaches to resolving the ambiguity of noun phrases fall roughly into two camps: adjacency and dependency. $$$$$ In this example we look at the behavior of noun phrases and the prepositional phrases that follow them.

 $$$$$ Many properties of a word sense or the semantic relationships between word senses are available in MRDs, but this information can only be identified computationally through some analysis of the definition text of an entry (Atkins 1991).
 $$$$$ We would also like to thank Mats Rooth, Scott Waterman, and four anonymous reviewers for useful comments and discussion.

Finally, (Pustejovsky et al, 1993) present an interesting framework for the acquisition of semantic relations from corpora not only relying on statistics, but guided by theoretical lexicon principles. $$$$$ We will assume, for this paper, the general framework of a generative lexicon as outlined in Pustejovsky (1991).

The best known early work on automated unsupervised NC bracketing is that of Lauer (1995) who introduces the probabilistic dependency model for the syntactic disambiguation of NCs and argues against the adjacency model, proposed by Marcus (1980), Pustejovsky et al (1993) and Resnik (1993). $$$$$ We describe research on conversion of a machine-tractable dictionary (Wilks et al. 1993) into a usable lexical knowledge base (Boguraev 1991).

Pustejovsky et al (1993) show how statistical techniques, such as mutual information measures can contribute to automatically acquire lexical information regarding the link between a noun and a predicate. $$$$$ Such information about how nouns relate to other lexical items and their concepts might prove to be much more useful in full-text information retrieval than what has come from standard statistical techniques.
Pustejovsky et al (1993) show how statistical techniques, such as mutual information measures can contribute to automatically acquire lexical information regarding the link between a noun and a predicate. $$$$$ Techniques for identifying explicit information in machine-readable dictionaries have been developed by many researchers (Boguraev et al. 1989; Slator 1988; Slator and Wilks 1987; Guthrie et al.

For example, Pustejovsky et al (1993) use generalized syntactic patterns for extracting qualia structures from a partially parsed corpus. $$$$$ This process and the corpus tuning for both argument typing and subcategorization acquisition are described in Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky (1992) and Pustejovsky et al.

Concerning relatedness measure, additional corpus-based measures such as Web-basedmeasures (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007) or measures based on syntactic relations (Pustejovsky et al, 1993) could appear to be useful for improving the ranking of the extracted relations. $$$$$ In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference relations can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.
