In addition, Dagan and Itai (1991) undertook additional pre-editing such as the removal of sentences for which the parser failed to produce a reasonable parse, cases where the antecedent was not an NP etc.; Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) manually removed 30 occurrences of pleonastic pronouns (which could not be recognised by their pleonastic recogniser) as well as 6 occurrences of it which referred to a VP or prepositional constituent. $$$$$ (Kennedy and Boguraev,

Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), for example, need additional information about whether a certain discourse referent is embedded or not, plus a pointer to the COREF class associated to the referent, while Mitkov's approach needs a score associated to each noun phrase. $$$$$ 1 The connection between a dis- course referent and its COREF class is mediated through the COREF object as follows

As expected, the results reported in Table 1 do not match the original results published by Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), Baldwin (1997) and Mitkov (1998b) where the algorithms were tested on different data, employed different pre-processing tools, resorted to different degrees of manual intervention and thus provided no common ground for any reliable comparison. $$$$$ (Kennedy and Boguraev,

The grammar in Figure 4 will only parse coordinated prepositional phrases (pp), coordinated noun phrases (np), pronouns (p), conjunctions (conj) and verbs (verb) in whatever order that they appear in the text and it will allow us to work in a similar way that the algorithm mentioned in Kennedy and Boguraev (1996). $$$$$ This is accomplished by running a set of patterns which identify NPs that occur locally to ad- verbs, relative pronouns, and noun-preposition r noun- complementizer sequences over the tagged text in con- junction with the basic NP patterns described above.
