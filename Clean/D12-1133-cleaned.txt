In parsing, Bohnet and Nivre (2012) and Bohnet et al (2013) propose a model for joint morphological analysis, part-of speech tagging and dependency parsing using a Usingeval.pl from Buchholz and Marsi (2006). $$$$$ A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing
In parsing, Bohnet and Nivre (2012) and Bohnet et al (2013) propose a model for joint morphological analysis, part-of speech tagging and dependency parsing using a Usingeval.pl from Buchholz and Marsi (2006). $$$$$ Finally, as noted in the introduction, although joint tagging and parsing is rare in dependency parsing, most state-of-the-art parsers based on PCFG models naturally incorporate part-of-speech tagging and usually achieve better parsing accuracy (albeit not always tagging accuracy) with a joint model than with a pipeline approach (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

Bohnet and Nivre (2012)'s transition-based system jointly performs POS tagging and dependency parsing, which shows higher accuracy than ours. $$$$$ A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing
Bohnet and Nivre (2012)'s transition-based system jointly performs POS tagging and dependency parsing, which shows higher accuracy than ours. $$$$$ To our knowledge, this is the first joint system that performs labeled dependency parsing.

Bohnet and Nivre (2012) introduced a transition-based system that jointly performed POS tagging and dependency parsing. $$$$$ A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing
Bohnet and Nivre (2012) introduced a transition-based system that jointly performed POS tagging and dependency parsing. $$$$$ In this section, we start by defining a transition system for joint tagging and parsing based on the non-projective transition system proposed in Nivre (2009).
