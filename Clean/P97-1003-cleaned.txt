The last two counts (CAUS and ANIM) were performed on a 29-million word parsed corpus (gall Street Journal 1988, provided by Michael Collins (Collins, 1997)). $$$$$ Results on Wall Street Journal text show that the parser performs at 88.1/87.5% constituent precision/recall, an average improvement of 2.3% over (Collins 96).
The last two counts (CAUS and ANIM) were performed on a 29-million word parsed corpus (gall Street Journal 1988, provided by Michael Collins (Collins, 1997)). $$$$$ A PCFG can be lexicalised by associating a headword with each non-terminal in a parse tree; thus far, (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94) and (Collins 96), which both make heavy use of lexical information, have reported the best statistical parsing performance on Wall Street Journal text.

These sentences were parsed with the Collins' parser (Collins, 1997). $$$$$ The parser was trained on sections 02 - 21 of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 93) (approximately 40,000 sentences), and tested on section 23 (2,416 sentences).
These sentences were parsed with the Collins' parser (Collins, 1997). $$$$$ The model in (Collins 96) is deficient, that is for most sentences S, ET P(T I S) < 1, because probability mass is lost to dependency structures which violate the hard constraint that no links may cross.

Substantial improvements have been made to parse western language such as English, and many powerful models have been proposed (Brill 1993, Collins 1997). $$$$$ We use the PARSEVAL measures (Black et al. 91) to compare performance

This model is very similar to the markovized rule models in Collins (1997). $$$$$ The work makes two advances over previous models

In particular, empty nodes (represented as -NONE in the tree bank) were turned into rules that generated the empty string (), and there was no collapsing of categories (such as PRT and ADVP) as is of ten done in parsing work (Collins, 1997, etc.). $$$$$ In a PCFG, for a tree derived by n applications of context-free re-write rules LH Si RHS, 1 i n, The re-write rules are either internal to the tree, where LHS is a non-terminal and RHS is a string of one or more non-terminals; or lexical, where LHS is a part of speech tag and RHS is a word.

For example, the lexicalized grammars of Collins (1997) and Charniak (1997) and the state split grammars of Petrov et al (2006) are all too large to construct unpruned charts in memory. $$$$$ Three Generative Lexicalized Models For Statistical Parsing

Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing have emphasized the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (Collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly, but context-free phrase-structure grammars do not. $$$$$ In this paper we first propose a new statistical parsing model, which is a generative model of lexicalised context-free grammar.

 $$$$$ Adjuncts in the Penn Treebank We add the &quot;-C&quot; suffix to all non-terminals in training data which satisfy the following conditions

We use a mechanism similar to (Collins, 1997) but adapted to Chinese data to find lexical heads in the tree bank data. $$$$$ The addition of lexical heads leads to an enormous number of potential rules, making direct estimation of P(RHS I LHS) infeasible because of sparse data problems.

Judge et al (2006) produced a corpus of 4,000 questions annotated with syntactic trees, and obtained an improvement in parsing accuracy for Bikel's reimplementation of the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) by training a new parser model with a combination of newspaper and question data. $$$$$ Results on Wall Street Journal text show that the parser performs at 88.1/87.5% constituent precision/recall, an average improvement of 2.3% over (Collins 96).

In addition to portability experiments with the parsing model of (Collins, 1997), (Gildea, 2001) provided a comprehensive analysis of parser portability. $$$$$ Model 1 is essentially a generative version of the model described in (Collins 96).
In addition to portability experiments with the parsing model of (Collins, 1997), (Gildea, 2001) provided a comprehensive analysis of parser portability. $$$$$ In Model 3 we give a probabilistic treatment of wh-movement, which is derived from the analysis given in Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al. 95).

In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the model, all sentences were first automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997). $$$$$ For unknown words, the output from the tagger described in (Ratnaparkhi 96) is used as the single possible tag for that word.

Our model is thus a simplification of more sophisticated models which integrate PCFGs with features, such as those in Magerman (1995), Collins (1997) and Goodman (1997). $$$$$ The work makes two advances over previous models

This statistical technique of labeling predicate argument operates on the output of the probabilistic parser reported in (Collins, 1997). $$$$$ A post-processing stage could add this detail to the parser output, but we give two reasons for making the distinction while parsing

At last, the dependency parser presented in (Collins, 1997) is used to generate the full parse. $$$$$ Figure 1 shows a tree which will be used as an example throughout this paper.
