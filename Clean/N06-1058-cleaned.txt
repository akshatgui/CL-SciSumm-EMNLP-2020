Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) have shown that creating synthetic reference sentences by substituting synonyms from Wordnet into the original reference sentences can increase the number of exact word matches with an MT system's output and yield significant improvements in correlations of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores with human judgments of translation adequacy. $$$$$ This synthetic reference then replaces the original human reference in automatic evaluation.

Deriving lexical relatedness between terms has been a topic of interest with applications in word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al, 2005), paraphrasing (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006), question answering (Prager et al, 2001), and machine translation (Blatz et al, 2004) to name a few. $$$$$ These techniques are widely used in NLP applications, including language modeling, information extraction, and dialogue processing (Haghighi et al., 2005; Serafin and Eugenio, 2004; Miller et al., 2004).

Banerjee and Lavie (2005) and Chan and Ng (2008) use WordNet, and Zhou et al (2006) and Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) exploit large collections of automatically-extracted paraphrases. $$$$$ Examples of such knowledge sources include stemming and TF-IDF weighting (Babych and Hartley, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).

Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) used paraphrases of the reference translations to improve automatic MT evaluation. $$$$$ The key findings of our work are as follows

Some researchers extract synonyms as paraphrases (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006), while some others use looser definitions, such as hypernyms and holonyms (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997). $$$$$ As a solution to this problem, researchers use multiple references to refine automatic evaluation.
Some researchers extract synonyms as paraphrases (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006), while some others use looser definitions, such as hypernyms and holonyms (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997). $$$$$ Thus, among many possible paraphrases of the reference, we are interested only in those that use words appearing in the system output.

Training a classifier for word paraphrasing, Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) used occurrences of the rule's RHS as positive context examples, and randomly picked negative examples. $$$$$ For the negative examples, a random position in a sentence is selected for extracting the context.

Metrics in the Rouge family allow for skip n-grams (Lin and Och, 2004a); Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) take paraphrasing into account; metrics such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and GTM (Melamed et al., 2003) calculate both recall and precision; METEOR is also similar to SIA (Liu and Gildea, 2006) in that word class information is used. $$$$$ Automatic Paraphrasing and Entailment Our work is closely related to research in automatic paraphrasing, in particular, to sentence level paraphrasing (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004).

In text summarization (Zhou et al, 2006) and machine translation (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006), summaries comparison based on sentence similarity has been applied for automatic evaluation. $$$$$ In practice, this comparison breaks down to n-gram overlap between the reference and the machine output. machine translation from the NIST 2004 MT evaluation.

In addition, to allow for the possibility of valid lexical differences between the translation and the references, we follow Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) and Owczarzak et al (2006) in adding a number of paraphrases in the process of evaluation to raise the number of matches between the translation and the reference, leading to a higher score. $$$$$ Papineni et al.

Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) and Owczarzak et al (2006) use paraphrases during BLEU and NIST evaluation to increase the number of matches between the translation and the reference; the paraphrases are either taken from WordNet in Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) or derived from the test set itself through automatic word and phrase alignment in Owczarzak et al (2006). $$$$$ For example, Pang et al. (2003) expand a set of reference translations using syntactic alignment, and generate new reference sentences that could be used in automatic evaluation.
