Moreover, the TEASE collection of entailment rules (Szpektor et al, 2004) consists of 136 templates provided as input, plus all the learned templates. $$$$$ For each verb entry in the lexicon, we provided the judges with the corresponding pivot template and the list of related candidate entailment templates found by the system.

TEASE (Szpektor et al, 2004) discovers binary relation templates from the Web base don sets of representative entities for given binary relation templates. $$$$$ Web searching is then used to find occurrences of the input anchor set, resulting in new templates that are supposed to specify the same relation as the original one (“born in”).

TEASE (Szpektor et al., 2004) discovers dependency sub-parses from the Web, based on sets of representative entities for a given lexical item. $$$$$ They limit the allowed structure of templates only to paths in dependency parses connecting two anchors.

Yet the current precision of acquisition algorithms is typically still mediocre, as illustrated in Table 1 for Dirt (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and TEASE (Szpektor et al, 2004), two prominent acquisition algorithms whose outputs are publicly available. $$$$$ Algorithms for paraphrase acquisition address two problems

Indeed, only few earlier works reported inter-judge agreement level, and those that did reported rather low Kappa values, such as 0.54 (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) and 0.55 0.63 (Szpektor et al, 2004). $$$$$ Interesting algorithms are presented in (Pang et al., 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2003).

Other types of relations that have been studied by pattern-based approaches include question answer relations (such as birthdates and inventor) (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), synonyms and antonyms (Lin et al, 2003), general purpose analogy (Turney et al, 2003), verb relations (including similarity, strength, antonym, enable ment and temporal) (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), entailment (Szpektor et al, 2004), and more specific relations, such as purpose, creation (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), LivesIn, and EmployedBy (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007). $$$$$ These include multiple translations of the same text (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) and corresponding articles from multiple news sources (Shinyama et al., 2002; Pang et al., 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2003).
