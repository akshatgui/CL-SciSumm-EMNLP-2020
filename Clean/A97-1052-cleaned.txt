In contrast, the system of (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) distinguishes 163 verbal subcategorisation classes by means of a statistical shallow parser, a classifier of subcategorisation classes, and a priori estimates of the probability that any verb will be a member of those classes. $$$$$ We achieve this performance by exploiting a more sophisticated robust statistical parser which yields complete though 'shallow' parses, a more comprehensive subcategorization class classifier, and a priori estimates of the probability of membership of these classes.

It is a well-documented fact (Briscoe and Carroll,1997) that subcategorisation frames (and their frequencies) vary across domains. $$$$$ This gives us an estimate of the accuracy of the relative frequencies of classes output by the system.
It is a well-documented fact (Briscoe and Carroll,1997) that subcategorisation frames (and their frequencies) vary across domains. $$$$$ These problems are compounded by the fact that predicate subcategorization is closely associated to lexical sense and the senses of a word change between corpora, sublanguages and/or subject domains (Jensen, 1991).
