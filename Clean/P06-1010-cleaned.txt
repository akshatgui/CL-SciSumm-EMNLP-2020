In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration; note that (Tao and Zhai, 2005) compares several different metrics for time correlation, as we also note below and see (Sproat et al., 2006). $$$$$ In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration.

However, several techniques for mining name transliterations from monolingual and comparable corpora have been studied (Pasternack and Roth, 2009), (Goldwasser and Roth, 2008), (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), (Sproat et al, 2006), (Udupa et al,2009b). $$$$$ Comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the literature (e.g.,(Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Franz et al., 1998; Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Masuichi et al., 2000; Sadat et al., 2003)), but transliteration in the context of comparable corpora has not been well addressed.

These include studying the query logs (Brill et al, 2001), unrelated corpora (Rapp, 1999), and comparable corpora (Sproat et al 2006). $$$$$ (Meng et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2004), the problem has been cast as the problem of producing, for a given Chinese name, an English equivalent such as one might need in a machine translation system.

An initial PSM is bootstrapped using limited prior knowledge such as a small amount of transliterations, which may be obtained by exploiting co-occurrence information (Sproat et al, 2006). $$$$$ For training data we have a small list of 721 names in Roman script and their Chinese equivalent.3 Pronunciations for English words are obtained using the Festival text-tospeech system (Taylor et al., 1998); for Chinese, we use the standard pinyin transliteration of the characters.

In transliteration extraction, mining translations or transliterations from the ever-growing multilingual Web has become an active research topic, for example, by exploring query logs (Brill et al., 2001) and parallel (Nie et al, 1999) or comparable corpora (Sproat et al, 2006). $$$$$ (Meng et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2004), the problem has been cast as the problem of producing, for a given Chinese name, an English equivalent such as one might need in a machine translation system.

(Sproat et al 2006) have compared names from comparable and contemporaneous English and Chinese texts, scoring matches by training a learning algorithm to compare the phonemic representations of the names in the pair, in addition to taking into account the frequency distribution of the pair over time. $$$$$ We further normalize the raw frequency vector so that it becomes a frequency distribution over all the time points (days).
(Sproat et al 2006) have compared names from comparable and contemporaneous English and Chinese texts, scoring matches by training a learning algorithm to compare the phonemic representations of the names in the pair, in addition to taking into account the frequency distribution of the pair over time. $$$$$ In both scoring methods described above, scoring of each candidate transliteration pair is independent of the other.

For example, (Sproat et al, 2006) presents a supervised system that achieves a MRR score of 0.89, when evaluated over a dataset consisting of 400 English NE and 627 Chinese words. $$$$$ We generated 627 Chinese candidates.
For example, (Sproat et al, 2006) presents a supervised system that achieves a MRR score of 0.89, when evaluated over a dataset consisting of 400 English NE and 627 Chinese words. $$$$$ We evaluated two strategies for combining the two methods.

(Sproat et al 2006) report an oracle accuracy of 85%, but it depends on the source of the candidate transliterations. $$$$$ The work we report is ongoing.
