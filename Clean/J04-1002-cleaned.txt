To determine whether semantic restrictions are being violated, domain information from ontologies/thesauri such as WordNet could be used and/or statistical techniques as used by Mason (2004). $$$$$ This regularity, detectable with a shallow linguistic analysis, is used to find the metaphorical interconcept mappings, which can then be used to infer the existence of higher-level conventional metaphors.

Previous work on automated metaphor detection includes Fass (1991), Martin (1990), and Mason (2004). $$$$$ Two of the most broadly effective computational models of metaphor are Fass (1991) and Martin (1990), in both of which metaphors are detected through selectionalpreference violations and interpreted using an ontology.
Previous work on automated metaphor detection includes Fass (1991), Martin (1990), and Mason (2004). $$$$$ Martin (1990) describes the Metaphor Interpretation, Denotation, and Acquisition System (MIDAS), a computational model of metaphor interpretation.

The CorMet system (Mason, 2004) dynamically mines domain specific corpora to find less frequent usages and identifies conceptual metaphors. $$$$$ CorMet’s domain-specific corpora are obtained from the Internet.
The CorMet system (Mason, 2004) dynamically mines domain specific corpora to find less frequent usages and identifies conceptual metaphors. $$$$$ CorMet uses gradients in selectional preferences learned from dynamically mined, domain-specific corpora to identify metaphoric mappings between concepts.

Mason (2004) shows how statistical analysis can automatically detect and extract conventional metaphors from corpora, though creative metaphors still remain a tantalizing challenge. $$$$$ Although MIDAS can quickly understand novel metaphors that are the descendants of metaphors in its memory, it cannot interpret compound metaphors or detect intermetaphor relationships besides inheritance.
Mason (2004) shows how statistical analysis can automatically detect and extract conventional metaphors from corpora, though creative metaphors still remain a tantalizing challenge. $$$$$ Since not all novel metaphors are descendants of common conventional metaphors, MIDAS’s coverage is limited.

 $$$$$ In the MILITARY domain, the object of assault selects strongly for fortification but not social group, whereas the selectional preferences for the object of attack are the opposite.
 $$$$$ CorMet demonstrates the viability of a computational, corpus-based approach to conventional metaphor but requires more work before it can constitute a viable NLP tool.

By finding semantic differences between the selectional preferences, it can articulate the higher-order structure of conceptual metaphors ((Mason, 2004), p. 24), finding mappings like LIQUID -> MONEY. $$$$$ CorMet finds conventional metaphors by finding systematic differences in selectional preferences between domains.

CorMet (Mason, 2004) is designed to extract known conventional metaphors from domain-specific textual corpora, which are derived from Google queries. $$$$$ CorMet’s domain-specific corpora are obtained from the Internet.

The CMI system described in this paper is informed largely by CorMet (Mason, 2004). $$$$$ CorMet first uses the selectional-preference-learning algorithm described in Resnik (1993), then clustering over the results.

Our method is different from automated work on metaphor recognition such as (Mason, 2004) and (Gedigian et al, 2006) in that it includes nouns as parts of speech. $$$$$ Queries for domain-specific documents containing a particular verb are composed of a conjunction of domain-specific terms and a disjunction of forms of the verb that are more likely to be verbs than other parts of speech.
