Although Mani et al (2006) use the links introduced by closure to boost the amount of training data for a tlink classifier, this technique is not suitable for our learning task since the closure might easily propagate errors in the automatic annotations. $$$$$ We can see that even after closure, the baseline of learning from unclosed human annotations is much poorer than ME-C, and is in fact substantially worse than the majority class on event ordering.
Although Mani et al (2006) use the links introduced by closure to boost the amount of training data for a tlink classifier, this technique is not suitable for our learning task since the closure might easily propagate errors in the automatic annotations. $$$$$ This means that for preprocessing new data sets to produce noisily annotated data for this classification task, it is far better to use machinelearning from closed human annotations rather than machine-learning from closed annotations produced by an intuitive baseline.

As such, it emphasizes robustness at Web scale, without taking advantage of existing specification languages for representing events and temporal expressions occurring in text (Pustejovsky et al, 2003), and forgoing the potential benefits of more complex methods that extract temporal relations from relatively clean text collections (Mani et al, 2006). $$$$$ TimeML (Pustejovsky et al. 2005) (www.timeml.org) is an annotation scheme for markup of events, times, and their temporal relations in news articles.
