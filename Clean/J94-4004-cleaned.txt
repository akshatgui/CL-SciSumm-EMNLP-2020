Using these simple, language agnostic measures allows one to look for divergence types such as those described by Dorr (1994). $$$$$ Introducing the notion of language-to-interlingua divergence allows the translation mapping to be defined in terms of a representation that is general enough to carry over to several different language pairs.

Theoretically, it is well-known that two languages often do not express the same meaning in the same way (Dorr, 1994). $$$$$ The one not shown here corresponds to the possessional sense of haben, i.e., the meaning corresponding to the word have in English.

One of the reasons for this difference is due to the different language pairs under study; (Meyers et al, 1998) deals with two languages that are closely related syntactically (Spanish and English) while we are dealing with languages that syntactically are quite divergent, Korean and English (Dorr, 1994). $$$$$ (See Barnett et al.

We suggest that alignment constraints such as this one can be used to define most of the possible syntactic divergences between languages (Dorr, 1994), and that only a handful of them are necessary for two given languages (we have identified 11 general alignment constraints necessary for Korean to English transfer so far). $$$$$ In particular, the solution given here eliminates the need for transfer rules and relies instead on parameterized mappings that are defined and applied uniformly across all languages.

However, structural divergences between languages (Dorr, 1994) which are due to either systematic differences between languages or loose translations in real corpora pose a major challenge to syntax-based statistical MT. $$$$$ This paper demonstrates that a systematic solution to the divergence problem can be derived from the formalization of two types of information
