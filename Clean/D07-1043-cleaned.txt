There are many possible methods for evaluating clustering quality (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ The problem of matchingcan manifest itself either by not evaluating the en tire membership of a cluster, or by not evaluating every cluster.

We evaluate both the inferred phonetic categories and words using the clustering evaluation measure V-Measure (VM; Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ We describe a document clustering experiment and evaluate its results using V-measure, high lighting the interaction between homogeneity and completeness.

This section presents the measures of unsupervised evaluation, i.e V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) and (2) paired F-Score (Artiles et al, 2009). $$$$$ We describe several popular external cluster evaluation measures and draw some comparisons to V-measure in Section 3.

V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) assesses the quality of a clustering solution by explicitly measuring its homogeneity and its completeness. $$$$$ V-measure is an entropy-based measure which explicitly measures how successfully the criteria of homogeneity and completeness have been satisfied.
V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) assesses the quality of a clustering solution by explicitly measuring its homogeneity and its completeness. $$$$$ First, Q0 does not explicitly calculate the degree of completeness of the clustering solution.

Homogeneity refers to the degree that each cluster consists of data points primarily belonging to a single GS class, while completeness refers to the degree that each GS class consists of data points primarily assigned to a single cluster (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ A clustering result sat isfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only data points which are members of a single class.

The V-measure (VM) (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) is an information theoretic metric that reports the harmonic mean of homogeneity (each cluster should contain only instances of a single class) and completeness (all instances of a class should be members of the same cluster). $$$$$ Homogeneity

A significant limitation of F-Score is that it does not evaluate the make up of clusters beyond the majority class (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ (Meila, 2007).

These two limitations define the matching problem of F-Score (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) which can lead to $$$$$ This problem can be trivially addressed by fixing the classcluster matching function and including it in the def inition of the measure as in H . However, a secondand more critical problem is the ?problem of matching?
These two limitations define the matching problem of F-Score (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) which can lead to $$$$$ cluster ing, these measures only consider the contributions from those clusters that are matched to a target class.This is a major problem, as two significantly differ ent clusterings can result in identical scores.

ubsequently, we present the use of V measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) as an evaluation measure that can overcome the current limitations of F-Score. $$$$$ V-Measure

As it can be observed, F-Score assesses the quality of a clustering solution by considering two different angles, i.e. homogeneity and completeness (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ The homogenity and completeness of a clustering solution run roughly in opposition

The former situation is present, due to the fact that F-Score does not consider the make-up of the clusters beyond the majority class (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ Consider, two degenerate clustering solutions.

This happens when each Gs class is included in all clusters with a distribution equal to the distribution of sizes (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ Note that H(C

This is due to the fact that V-measure considers as the worst solution in terms of completeness the one, in which each class is represented by every cluster, and specifically with a distribution equal to the distribution of cluster sizes (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007). $$$$$ That is, the class distribution within each cluster should beskewed to a single class, that is, zero entropy.

Two evaluation metrics are used during the unsupervised evaluation in order to estimate the quality of the clustering solutions, the V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) and the paired F Score (Artiles et al, 2009). $$$$$ Therefore, in order for the goodness of two clustering solutions to be compared using one these measures, an identicalpost-processing algorithm must be used.
