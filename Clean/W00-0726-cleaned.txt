Text chunking consists of dividing text into syntactically related non overlapping groups of words (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Text chunking consists of dividing a text into phrases in such a way that syntactically related words become member of the same phrase.
Text chunking consists of dividing text into syntactically related non overlapping groups of words (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ We have presented an introduction to the CoNLL-2000 shared task: dividing text into syntactically related non-overlapping groups of words, so-called text chunking.

Unlike the shallow phrases defined for the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), base phrases correspond directly to constituents that appear in full parses, and hence can provide a straightforward constraint on edges within a chart parser. $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task: Chunking

For the chunker, we ran fnTBL over the lemmatised tagged data, training over CoNLL 2000 style (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) chunk converted versions of the full Brown and WSJ corpora. $$$$$ An overview of the chunk types in the training data can be found in table 1.

The data set, extracted from the WSJ Penn Tree bank, and first used in the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), contains 211,727 training examples and 47,377 test instances. $$$$$ For the CoNLL shared task, we have chosen to work with the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the widely used data set for base noun phrase recognition (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): WSJ sections 15-18 of the Penn Treebank as training material and section 20 as test materia13.

Our chunks were derived from the Tree bank trees using the conversion described by Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz (2000). $$$$$ There are several difficulties when converting trees into chunks.

(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) Unlike a parse tree, a set of syntactic chunks has no hierarchical information on how sequences of words relate to each other. $$$$$ We have chosen to work with a corpus with parse information, the Wall Street Journal WSJ part of the Penn Treebank II corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), and to extract chunk information from the parse trees in this corpus.
(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) Unlike a parse tree, a set of syntactic chunks has no hierarchical information on how sequences of words relate to each other. $$$$$ Johansson (2000) uses context-sensitive and contextfree rules for transforming part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences to chunk tag sequences.
