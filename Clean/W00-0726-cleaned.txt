This data set was used for CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

Text chunking consists of dividing text into syntactically related non overlapping groups of words (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Text chunking consists of dividing a text into phrases in such a way that syntactically related words become member of the same phrase.
Text chunking consists of dividing text into syntactically related non overlapping groups of words (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ We have presented an introduction to the CoNLL-2000 shared task

Unlike the shallow phrases defined for the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), base phrases correspond directly to constituents that appear in full parses, and hence can provide a straightforward constraint on edges within a chart parser. $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

For the chunker, we ran fnTBL over the lemmatised tagged data, training over CoNLL 2000 style (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) chunk converted versions of the full Brown and WSJ corpora. $$$$$ An overview of the chunk types in the training data can be found in table 1.
For the chunker, we ran fnTBL over the lemmatised tagged data, training over CoNLL 2000 style (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) chunk converted versions of the full Brown and WSJ corpora. $$$$$ Both he and Buchholz et al. use data generated by the script that produced the CoNLL-2000 shared task data sets.

The data set, extracted from the WSJ Penn Tree bank, and first used in the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), contains 211,727 training examples and 47,377 test instances. $$$$$ For the CoNLL shared task, we have chosen to work with the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the widely used data set for base noun phrase recognition (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)

We annotate the same set of 800 tweets mentioned previously with tags from the CoNLL shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz,2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

Our chunks were derived from the Tree bank trees using the conversion described by Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz (2000). $$$$$ There are several difficulties when converting trees into chunks.
Our chunks were derived from the Tree bank trees using the conversion described by Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz (2000). $$$$$ Tjong Kim Sang (2000) trained and tested five memory-based learning systems to produce different representations of the chunk tags.

The shallow parse tags define non hierarchical base constituents (chunks), as defined for the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) Unlike a parse tree, a set of syntactic chunks has no hierarchical information on how sequences of words relate to each other. $$$$$ We have chosen to work with a corpus with parse information, the Wall Street Journal WSJ part of the Penn Treebank II corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), and to extract chunk information from the parse trees in this corpus.
(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) Unlike a parse tree, a set of syntactic chunks has no hierarchical information on how sequences of words relate to each other. $$$$$ Johansson (2000) uses context-sensitive and contextfree rules for transforming part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences to chunk tag sequences.

We used the same data set as the CoNLL 2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

The project provided a data set for this task at the CoNLL-2000 workshop (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

Chunking was the shared task of CoNLL-2000, the workshop on Computational Natural Language Learning, held in Lisbon, Portugal in 2000 (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

The task was extended to additional phrase types for the CoNLL 2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), which is now the standard evaluation task for shallow parsing. $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

NP chunking results have been reported on two slightly different data sets $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

Headwords are obtained from a parse tree with the script used for the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

In the chunk inventory devised for the CoNLL-2000 test chunking shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000), a dedicated particle chunk type once again exists. $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

Indeed, all the best systems in the CoNLL shared task competitions (e.g. Chunking (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000)) make extensive use of lexical information. $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task

The conversion program is the same as used for the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000). $$$$$ Introduction To The CoNLL-2000 Shared Task
