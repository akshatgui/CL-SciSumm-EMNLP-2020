[Interest] is a binary version of the word sense disambiguation data from (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ Unlike several previous approaches to word sense disambiguation ([29], [5], [7], [10]), nothing in this approach limits the selection of sense tags to a particular number or type of meaning distinctions.

One set was extracted from a hand-tagged corpus (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) and the other by our algorithm. $$$$$ In total, 2,476 usages2 of interest as a noun3 were automatically extracted from the corpus and manually assigned sense tags corresponding to the LDOCE definitions.
One set was extracted from a hand-tagged corpus (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) and the other by our algorithm. $$$$$ Portions of the test set that are not covered by the estimates of the parameters made from the training set are not tagged and, therefore, counted as wrong.

 $$$$$ As such, decomposable models are models that can be expressed as a product of marginals,1 where each marginal consists of only interdependent variables.

We also make use of these properties in formulating the empirical classifiers as described in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ In this paper, a different approach to formulating a probabilistic model is presented along with a case study of the performance of models produced in this manner for the disambiguation of the noun describe a method for formulating probabilistic models that use multiple contextual features for word-sense disambiguation, without requiring untested assumptions regarding the form of the model.
We also make use of these properties in formulating the empirical classifiers as described in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994). $$$$$ Our approach to combining these two paradigms hinges on the network representations of our probabilistic models as described in Section 4 and will make use of the methods presented in [21].

An example of the type of feature used is the part-of-speech of the word to the right; see (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) for the other ones we use. $$$$$ Techniques for identifying the optimum feature to use in disambiguating a word are presented in [7], [30] and [5].
An example of the type of feature used is the part-of-speech of the word to the right; see (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) for the other ones we use. $$$$$ Further, different types of variables, such as class-based and collocation-specific ones, can be used in combination with one another.

The Interest data set developed by Bruce and Wiebe (1994) has been previously used for WSD (Ng and Lee, 1996). $$$$$ During tagging, 107 usages were removed from the data set due to the authors' inability to classify them in terms of the set of LDOCE senses.

The next significant hand tagging task was reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), where 2,476 usages of interest were manually assigned with sense tags from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE). $$$$$ We selected as the set of tags all non-idiomatic noun senses of defined in the electronic version of Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) ([23]).
