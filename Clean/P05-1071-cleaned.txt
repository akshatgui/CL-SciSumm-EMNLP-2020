Both Diab et al (2004) and Habash and Rambow (2005) use support-vector machines with local features; the former for tokenization, POS tagging, and base phrase chunking; the latter for full morphological disambiguation. $$$$$ They use the same SVMbased learner we do, Yamcha, for three different tagging tasks

Habash and Sadat (2006) use the Arabic morphological analyzer MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005) to segment the Arabic source; they propose various segmentation schemes. $$$$$ We use the ALMORGEANA morphological analyzer (Habash, 2005), a lexeme-based morphological generator and analyzer for Arabic.5 A sample output of the morphological analyzer is shown in Figure 1.

Most available Arabic NLP tools and resources model morphology using surface inflectional features and do not mark rationality; this includes the PATB (Maamouri et al, 2004), the Buckwalter morphological analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) and tools using them such as the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic (MADA) system (Habash and Rambow, 2005). $$$$$ The data we use comes from the Penn Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004).

The algorithm we proposed in (Habash and Rambow, 2005) for choosing the best BAMA analysis simply counts the number of predicted values for the set of linguistic features in each candidate analysis. $$$$$ In addition, we define a second set of features which abstracts over the first set

MADA (Habash and Rambow, 2005) is used to pre-process the Arabic text for the translation model and 5-gram language model (LM). $$$$$ As a result of this process, we have the original text, with each word augmented with values for all the features in Figure 2.

Habash and Rambow (2005) use SVM-classifiers for individual morphological features and a simple combining scheme for choosing among competing analyses proposed by the dictionary. $$$$$ Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we do not use the notion of ambiguity class in the feature classifiers; instead we investigate different ways of using the results of the individual feature classifiers in directly choosing among the options produced for the word by the morphological analyzer.

To make our results more comparable to those by Habash and Rambow (2005), we converted the test set with the POS tags from the whole word tagger to their tokenization and to a reduced tag set of 15 tags. $$$$$ The large set of Arabic tags has been mapped (by the Linguistic Data Consortium) to this smaller English set, and the meaning of the English tags has changed.
