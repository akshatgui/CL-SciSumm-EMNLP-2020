These realizers, along with RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), accept tense as a parameter, but do not calculate it from a semantic representation of overlapping time intervals such as ours (though the Nigel grammar can calculate tense from speech, event, and reference time orderings, discussed below). $$$$$ REALPRO is really a realizer shell, which allows for a (run-time) configuration using specially formatted Linguistic Knowledge Bases (LKBs) which state grammar rules, lexical entries, and feature defaults.

We adopt Deep Syntactic Structures (DSyntSs) as a format for syntactic structures because they can be realized by the fast portable realizer RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ A Fast And Portable Realizer For Text Generation Systems

In this sense, they are functionally similar to the REALPRO system (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ REALPRO has the following characteristics, which we believe are unique in this combination

We automatically converted the phrase structure output of the Collins parser into the syntactic dependency representation used by our syntactic realizer, RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ The input to REALPRO is a syntactic dependency structure.
We automatically converted the phrase structure output of the Collins parser into the syntactic dependency representation used by our syntactic realizer, RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ We conclude that the uniformity of the syntactic constructions found in the sentences used in the above test sequence does not influence the results.

Discourse relations are essentially rhetorical structure theory (RST) relations [Mann and Thompson, 1987], and messages are represented using a deep-syntactic representation, which is loosely based on RealPro [Lavoie and Rambow, 1997]. $$$$$ The input to REALPRO is a syntactic dependency structure.

Currently, FLO supports the LinGOrealiser (Carrollet al, 1999), but we are also looking at FLO modules for RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) and FUF/SURGE (Elhadad et al, 1997). $$$$$ REALPRO is derived from previous systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1988; Iordanslcaja et al., 1992; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992), but represents a new design and a completely new implementation.

In the second phase, the sentence plan ranker (SPR) ranks sentence plans generated by the SPG, and then selects the top-ranked out put as input to the surface realizer, RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ While text and sentence planning may sometimes be combined, a realizer is almost always included as a distinct module.

As rightly pointed out by Belz (2008), traditional wide coverage realizers such as KPML (Bateman et al, 2005), FUF/SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1996) and RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), which were also intended as off-the-shelf plug-in realizers still tend to require a considerable amount of work for integration and fine-tuning of the grammatical and lexical resources. $$$$$ Instead, such projects use an off-the-shelf realizer, among which PENMAN (Bateman, 1996) and SURGE/FUF (Elhadad and Robin, 1996) are probably the most popular.

Realization is achieved with the RealPro surface realizer (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ Realization is fairly well understood both from a linguistic and from a computational point of view, and therefore most projects that use text generation do not include the realizer in the scope of their research.
Realization is achieved with the RealPro surface realizer (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ In this technical note and demo we present a new off-theshelf realizer, REALPRO.

The top ranked sentence plan output by the SPR is input to the RealPro surface realizer which produces a surface linguistic utterance (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997). $$$$$ Furthermore, there is no non-determinism in REALPRO

Finally, surface realization is performed by interfacing RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) with a language model. $$$$$ Typically, natural language generation is divided into several phases, namely text planning (determining output content and structure), sentence planning (determining abstract target language resources to express content, such as lexical items and syntactic constructions), and realization (producing the final text string) (Reiter, 1994).

The surface realization process is performed by RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow (1997)). $$$$$ The complexity of the generation algorithm derives primarily from the tree traversals which must be performed twice, when passing from DSyntS to SSyntS, and from SSyntS to the DMorphS.

Over the past several years, a significant consensus has emerged over the definition of the realisation task, through the development of realisers such as REALPRO (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), ALETH GEN (Coch, 1996), KPML (Bateman, 1997), FUF/SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1996), HALO GEN (Langkilde, 2000), YAG (McRoy et al, 2000), and OPENCCG (White, 2006).
