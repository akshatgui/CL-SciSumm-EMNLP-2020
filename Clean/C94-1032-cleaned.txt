N-gram models arc usually used for scoring (Gu et al, 1991) (Nagata, 1994), but their training requires the sentences of the corpus to be manualy segmented, and even class-tagged if class-based N-gram is used, as in (Nagata, 1994). $$$$$ Figure 5 shows tile percentage of sentences (not words) correctly segmented and tagged.

 $$$$$ In the forward search, we use a table called parse-list, whose key is the end position of the parse  structure, and wlm,se value is a list of parse structures that have the best partial path scores for each combined state at the end position.

Around 95% word segmentation accuracy is reported by using a word-based language model and the Viterbi-like dynamic programming procedure [Nagata, 1994, Takeuchi and Matsumoto, 1995, Yamamoto, 1996]. $$$$$ Since the segmentation accuracy of the proposed sys- tem is relatively high (97.7% recall and 97.2% precision for the top candidate) compared to the morphologi- cal analysis accuracy, it is likely that we can improve the part of speech assignment accuracy by refining the statistically-based tagging model.

Word Segmentation accuracy is expressed in terms of recall and precision as is done for bracketing of partial parses [Nagata, 1994, Sproat et al, 1996]. $$$$$ For open texts, tile morphological nalyzer achieved 95.1% recall and 94.6% precision for the top candidate, and 97.8% recall and 73.2% precision for the 5 best candidates.

Nagata (1994) proposed a stochastic word segmenter based on a word-gram model to solve the word segmentation problem. $$$$$ Once word hypotheses for unknown words are gener- ated, the proposed N-best algorithm will find tile most likely word segmentation a d part of speech assignment taking into account he entire sentence.

Fully stochastic language models (e.g. Nagata 1994), on the other hand, do not allow such manual cost manipulation and precisely for that reason, improvements in segmentation accuracy are harder to achieve. $$$$$ The reason is described later.
