Recent research indicates that using labeled and unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning (SSL) environment, with an emphasis on graph-based methods, can improve the performance of information extraction from data for tasks such as question classification (Tri et al, 2006), web classification (Liu et al., 2006), relation extraction (Chen et al, 2006), passage-retrieval (Otterbacher et al, 2009), various natural language processing tasks such as part of-speech tagging, and named-entity recognition (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008), word-sense disambiguation (Niu et al, 2005), etc. $$$$$ This paper provides evidence that the use of more unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can improve the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic chunking, and named entity recognition.
