Previous work has also used surface features in their parsers, but the focus has been on machine learning methods (Taskar et al, 2004), latent annotations (Petrov and Klein, 2008a; Petrov and Klein, 2008b), or implementation (Finkel et al, 2008). $$$$$ In reranking methods (Johnson et al., 1999; Collins, 2000; Shen et al., 2003), an initial parser is used to generate a number of candidate parses.

We use the terminology in (Taskar et al, 2004) for a generic structured output prediction, and define a part. $$$$$ Hence, in our experiments we use an online coordinate descent method analogous to the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) used for SVMs (Platt, 1999) and adapted to structured max-margin estimation in Taskar et al. (2003).

Taskar et al (2004) describe a max-margin approach; however, in this work training sentences were limited to be of 15 words or less. $$$$$ The primary contribution of this paper is the extension of the max-margin approach of Taskar et al. (2003) to context free grammars.

Collins and Roark (2004) and Taskar et al (2004) beat the generative baseline only after using the standard trick of using the output from a generative model as a feature. $$$$$ The first feature was the prediction of the generative baseline; this feature added little information, but made the learning phase faster.

Additionally, we exploit the flexibility of the discriminative framework both to improve the treatment of unknown words as well as to include span features (Taskar et al, 2004), giving the benefit of some input features integrally in our dynamic program. $$$$$ For example, O could include features which identify the rule used in the production, or features which track the rule identity together with features of the words at positions s, m, e, and neighboring positions in the sentence x.
