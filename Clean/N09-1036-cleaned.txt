One way to solve the mixing problem is for the sampler to make more global moves, e.g., with table label resampling (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009) or split-merge (Jain and Neal, 2000). $$$$$ Consider the problem of learning language from continuous speech

Johnson and Goldwater (2009) showed that word segmentation accuracy improves further if the model learns a nested hierarchy of collocations. $$$$$ While adaptor grammars cannot express the Goldwater et al. bigram model, they can get much the same effect by directly modelling collocations (Johnson, 2008).
Johnson and Goldwater (2009) showed that word segmentation accuracy improves further if the model learns a nested hierarchy of collocations. $$$$$ Because Colloc is adapted, the collocation adaptor grammar learns Collocations as well as Words.

The starting point and baseline for our extension is the adaptor grammar with syllable structure phonotactic constraints and three levels of collocational structure (5-21), as prior work has found that this yields the highest word segmentation token f-score (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ Here we present an adaptor grammar that models collocations together with these phonotactic constraints.

We use the standard hyperparameters values α = 1.0, β = 0.01 and τ = 1.0 and run the sampler for 1000 iterations, but one can use techniques like slice sampling to estimate the hyperparameters (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ First, we can integrate out θ, and second, we can infer values for the adaptor hyperparameters using sampling.

The Dirichlet parameters α are drawn independently from a Γ(1, 1) distribution, and are resampled using slice sampling at frequent intervals throughout the sampling process (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ After each Gibbs sweep through the parse trees t we resampled each of the adaptor parameters from the posterior distribution of the parameter using a slice sampler 10 times.
The Dirichlet parameters α are drawn independently from a Γ(1, 1) distribution, and are resampled using slice sampling at frequent intervals throughout the sampling process (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ This is easy to do in the context of Gibbs sampling, since this distribution is a minor variant of the distribution P(ti I t−i, wi) used during Gibbs sampling itself.

Hierarchical Bayes methods have been mainstream in unsupervised word segmentation since the dawn of hierarchical Dirichlet process (Goldwater et al, 2009) and adaptors grammar (Johnsonand Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ Dirichlet Processes and their associated predictive distributions, Chinese Restaurant Processes, are one kind of nonparametric Bayesian model that has received considerable attention recently, in part because they can be composed in hierarchical fashion to form Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) (Teh et al., 2006).

For the runs where adaptation was used we set the initial Pitman-Yor a and b parameters to 0.01 and 10 respectively, then slice sample (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ After each Gibbs sweep through the parse trees t we resampled each of the adaptor parameters from the posterior distribution of the parameter using a slice sampler 10 times.
For the runs where adaptation was used we set the initial Pitman-Yor a and b parameters to 0.01 and 10 respectively, then slice sample (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ This means that in batch initialization each initial parse tree is randomly generated without any adaptation at all.

 $$$$$ In the “Chinese Restaurant” metaphor samples produced by the adaptor are viewed as “customers” and zn is the index of the “table” that the nth customer is seated at.

This is the same set-up used by Liang and Klein (2009), Goldwater et al (2006), and Johnson and Goldwater (2009). $$$$$ The adaptor grammar algorithm is basically a Gibbs sampler of the kind widely used for nonparametric Bayesian inference (Blei et al., 2004; Goldwater et al., 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2006a), so it seems reasonable to expect that at least some of the details discussed below will be relevant to other applications as well.

It is substantially simpler than the non-parametric Bayesian models proposed by Johnson et al (2007), which require sampling procedures to perform inference and achieve an F1 of 87 (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ Nonparametric Bayesian methods produce state-of-the-art performance on this task (Goldwater et al., 2006a; Goldwater et al., 2007; Johnson, 2008).

While in principle, increasing the number of rejuvenation steps and particles will make this gap smaller and smaller, we believe the existence of the gap to be interesting in its own right, suggesting a general difference in learning behaviour between batch and incremental learners, especially given the similar results in Johnson and Goldwater (2009). $$$$$ That paper leaves unspecified a number of implementation details, which we show can make a crucial difference to segmentation accuracy.

Furthermore, adaptor grammars have largely been applied to the task of unsupervised structural induction from raw texts such as morphology analysis, word segmentation (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009), and dependency grammar induction (Cohen et al., 2010), rather than constituent syntax parsing. $$$$$ Nonparametric Bayesian methods produce state-of-the-art performance on this task (Goldwater et al., 2006a; Goldwater et al., 2007; Johnson, 2008).

We use the standard Brent corpus (Brent and Cartwright,1996), which includes 9,790 unsegmented phonemic representations of utterances of child-directed speech from the Bernstein-Ratner (1987) corpus. Johnson and Goldwater (2009) test three grammars for this segmentation task. $$$$$ Cumulatively these changes make a significant difference in word segmentation accuracy

GUnigram and GSyllable can be found in Johnson and Goldwater (2009). $$$$$ Nonparametric Bayesian methods produce state-of-the-art performance on this task (Goldwater et al., 2006a; Goldwater et al., 2007; Johnson, 2008).

For example, with GUnigram convergence typically takes 40 iterations with variational inference, while Johnson and Goldwater (2009) ran their sampler for 2,000 iterations, for which 1,000 were for burning in. $$$$$ For each setting in the experiments described in Table 1 we ran 8 samplers for 2,000 iterations (i.e., passes through the training data), and kept the sample parse trees from every 10th iteration after iteration 1000, resulting in 800 sample parses for every sentence.

This is a new application of adaptor grammars, which have so far been used in segmentation (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009) and named entity recognition (Elsner et al, 2009). $$$$$ This section informally introduces adaptor grammars using unsupervised word segmentation as a motivating application; see Johnson et al.

Johnson and Goldwater (2009) have proposed a novel method based on adaptor grammars, whose accuracy surpasses the aforementioned methods by a large margin, when appropriate assumptions are made regarding the structural units of a language. $$$$$ Given an appropriate adaptor grammar, the features learned by adaptor grammars can correspond to linguistic units such as words, syllables and collocations.

Modeling the corpus using hierarchical grammars that can model the input at varying levels (word collocations, words, syllables, onsets, etc.) provide the learner the most flexibility, allowing the learner to build structure from the individual phonemes and apply distributions at each level of abstraction (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009). $$$$$ But because it assumes that the probability of a word is determined purely by multiplying together the probability of its individual phonemes, it has no way to encode the fact that certain strings of phonemes (the words of the language) have much higher probabilities than other strings containing the same phonemes.
