The phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) technique is employed to identify and correct writing errors (Brockett et al, 2006). $$$$$ In this paper, we explore the use of a large-scale production statistical machine translation system to correct a class of ESL errors.

Recent work by Brockett et al (2006) utilized phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) techniques to correct ESL writing errors and demonstrated that this data-intensive SMT approach is very promising, but they also pointed out SMT approach relies on the availability of large amount of training data. $$$$$ Correcting ESL Errors Using Phrasal SMT Techniques

Brockett et al (2006) introduce errors involving mass/count noun confusions into English newswire text and then use the resulting parallel corpus to train a phrasal SMT system to perform error correction. $$$$$ Section 3 discusses the data used in our experiment, which is aimed at repairing a common type of ESL error that is not well-handled by current grammar checking technology: mass/count noun confusions.
Brockett et al (2006) introduce errors involving mass/count noun confusions into English newswire text and then use the resulting parallel corpus to train a phrasal SMT system to perform error correction. $$$$$ This class of errors (involving nouns that cannot be counted, such as information, pollution, and homework) is characteristically encountered in ESL writing by native speakers of several East Asian languages (Dalgish, 1983; Hua & Lee, 2004).1 We began by identifying a list of English nouns that are frequently involved in mass/count errors in by writing by Chinese ESL learners, by taking the intersection of words which: 2 CLEC tagging is not comprehensive; some common mass noun errors (e.g., make a good progress) are not tagged in this corpus.

Brockett et al (2006) showed that phrase-based statistical MT can help to correct mistakes made on mass nouns. $$$$$ Instead, wholesale replacement of the phrase knew many informations with the phrase learned a lot is needed to produce idiomatic-sounding output.
Brockett et al (2006) showed that phrase-based statistical MT can help to correct mistakes made on mass nouns. $$$$$ In this paper, we focus on countability errors associated with mass nouns.

Similar to our approach, Brockettet al (2006) view error correction as a Machine Translation problem. $$$$$ In particular, the SMT approach provides a natural mechanism for suggesting a correction, rather than simply stranding the user with a flag indicating that the text contains an error.
Similar to our approach, Brockettet al (2006) view error correction as a Machine Translation problem. $$$$$ In fact, the approach presented here benefits from all the advantages of statistical machine translation.

Note that our approach is different from that of Brockett et al (2006), as we do make use of a truly multi-lingual translation model. $$$$$ In this paper, we show that a noisy channel model instantiated within the paradigm of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993) can successfully provide editorial assistance for non-native writers.

To construct the training corpus, we followed the idea in Brockett et al (2006), and applied a similar strategy described in section 3.4 to the SRL system's training data to generate aligned pairs. $$$$$ Linearity of the training data may play a role, since the sentence pairs differ by only a few words.
To construct the training corpus, we followed the idea in Brockett et al (2006), and applied a similar strategy described in section 3.4 to the SRL system's training data to generate aligned pairs. $$$$$ On the whole, however, we expect the systemâ€™s order model to benefit from more training data.

Because of the great flexibility of the log-linear model, researchers have used the framework for other tasks outside SMT, including grammatical error correction (Brockett et al, 2006). $$$$$ In this paper, we show that a noisy channel model instantiated within the paradigm of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993) can successfully provide editorial assistance for non-native writers.
