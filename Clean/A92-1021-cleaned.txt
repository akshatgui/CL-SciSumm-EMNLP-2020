The noun phrase extraction module uses Brill's POS tagger [Brill (1992)] and a base NPchunker [Ramshaw and Marcus (1995)]. $$$$$ This is because a noun phrase is much more likely to immediately follow a preposition than to immediately follow infinitive TO.
The noun phrase extraction module uses Brill's POS tagger [Brill (1992)] and a base NPchunker [Ramshaw and Marcus (1995)]. $$$$$ Everything except for the proper noun discovery procedure is automatically acquired by the rule-based tagger7, making it much more portable than a stochastic tagger.

 $$$$$ The fact that the simple rule-based tagger can perform so well should offer encouragement for researchers to further explore rule-based tagging, searching for a better and more expressive set of patch templates and other variations on this simple but effective theme.

In order to include features describing verb tense, we use Brill's part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1992). Each part of speech (POS) is taken to be a feature, whose value is a count of the number of occurrences in the given utterance. $$$$$ A Simple Rule-Based Part Of Speech Tagger

In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the ME model in WSD tasks, all sentences containing the target word are automatically part-of speech (POS) tagged using the Brill POS tagger (Brill, 1992). $$$$$ Once the parameters of the model are estimated, a sentence can then be automatically tagged by assigning it the tag sequence which is assigned the highest probability by the model.

In the part-of-speech literature, whether taggers are based on a rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons, 1963), (Brill, 1992), (Voutilainen, 1993), or on a statistical one (Bahl and Mercer, 1976), (Leech et al, 1983), (Merialdo, 1994), (DeRose, 1988), (Church, 1989), (Cutting et al, 1992), there is a debate as to whether more attention should be paid to lexical probabilities rather than contextual ones. $$$$$ One area in which the statistical approach has done particularly well is automatic part of speech tagging, assigning each word in an input sentence its proper part of speech [Church 88; Cutting et al. 92; DeRose 88; Deroualt and Merialdo 86; Garside et al.

Compared to learning rule-based approaches such as the one by Brill (1992), a k-nn approach provides a uniform approach for all disambiguation tasks, more flexibility in the engineering of case representations, and a more elegant approach to handling of unknown words (see e.g. Cardie 1994). $$$$$ The rule-based tagger overcomes the limitations common in rule-based approaches to language processing
