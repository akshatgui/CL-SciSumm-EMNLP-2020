Very recently, Yamada and Knight (2001) described a model in which the noisy-channel takes as input a parsed sentence rather than simple words. $$$$$ To incorporate structural aspects of the language, our channel model accepts a parse tree as an input, i.e., the input sentence is preprocessed by a syntactic parser.

This example also shows that, one-level SCFG rule, even if informed by the Treebank as in (Yamada and Knight, 2001), is not enough to capture a common construction like this which is five levels deep (from VP to by). $$$$$ We first introduce our translation model with an example.

In applications such as the syntax based machine translation model of (Yamada and Knight, 2001), a low quality tree might lead to errorenous translation of the sentence. $$$$$ A Syntax-Based Statistical Translation Model
In applications such as the syntax based machine translation model of (Yamada and Knight, 2001), a low quality tree might lead to errorenous translation of the sentence. $$$$$ We have presented a syntax-based translation model that statistically models the translation process from an English parse tree into a foreignlanguage sentence.

We adapt the Japanese-to-English translation model of Yamada and Knight (2001) by transforming it from an English-tree-to-Japanese-string model to an English-tree-to-Japanese-tree model. $$$$$ Therefore, the probability of the Japanese sentence given the English parse tree is the sum of all these probabilities.

Yamada and Knight (2001) use a parser in the target language to train probabilities on a set of 609 operations that transform a target parse tree into a source string. $$$$$ Our model transforms a source-language parse tree into a target-language string by applying stochastic operations at each node.

Therefore, we have introduced a variation of the Inside-Outside algorithm as seen in (Yamada and Knight, 2001) for E step computation. $$$$$ We define an alpha probability and a beta probability for each major-node, in analogy with the measures used in the inside-outside algorithm for probabilistic context free grammars (Baker, 1979).

In part to deal with this problem, Yamada and Knight (2001) flatten the trees in a pre-processing step by collapsing nodes with the same lexical head-word. $$$$$ Second, a subtree was flattened if the node’s head-word was the same as the parent’s headword.
