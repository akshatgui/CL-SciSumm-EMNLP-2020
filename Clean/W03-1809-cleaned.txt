Bannard et al (2003) extended this research in looking explicitly at the task of classifying verb-particles as being compositional or not. $$$$$ Similarly to this research, McCarthy et al. in part used the similarity measure of Lin (1998a) to model compositionality, e.g., in taking the top N similar words to each VPC and looking at overlap with the top N similar words to the head verb.

Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ Baldwin et al. (2003) use LSA as a technique for analysing the compositionality (or decomposability) of a given MWE.
Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully compositional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ They do not go as far as to classify MWEs as being compositional or non-compositional, however.

They are also extremely diverse: for example ,onthe semantic dimension alone, MWEs cover an en tire spectrum, ranging from frozen, fixed idioms to free combinations of words (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ This use of entailment in exploring the semantics of verb and preposition combinations was first proposed by Hawkins (2000), and applied to VPCs by Lohse et al. (in preparation).

Note that although Lin characterizes his work as detecting non-compositionality, we agree with Bannard et al (2003) that it is better thought of as tapping into productivity.plore whether the light verbs themselves show different patterns in terms of how they are used semi productively in these constructions. $$$$$ Perhaps the singularly most influential work on MWE non-compositionality is that of Lin (1999).

Bannard (2005), extending work by Bannard et al (2003), instead considers the extent to which the verb and particle each contribute semantically to the VPC. $$$$$ The first of these loosely followed Lin in measuring the extent to which the component verb or particle of any VPC could be replaced with items of a similar semantic class to form a corpusattested VPC; WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) was used as the source for verb substitution candidates, and a hand-build semantic taxonomy for particles.

Semantically, the compositionality of MWEs is gradual, ranging from fully com positional to idiomatic (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ McCarthy et al. (2003) carry out research close in spirit to that described here, in taking VPC tokens automatically extracted from the BNC and using an automatically acquired thesaurus to classify their relative compositionality.

Bannard et al (2003), on the other hand, look at the separate contribution of the verb and particle, but assume that a binary decision on the compositionality of each is sufficient. $$$$$ Bannard (2002) used a combination of hand-built thesauri and corpus statistics to explore the compositionality of VPCs.

 $$$$$ Rather than intervene to customise example sentences to a prescribed sense, we accepted whatever composition of senses random sampling produced.
 $$$$$ We then implemented four different techniques and showed that they offer a significant improvement over a naive approach.

They do not fall cleanly into mutually exclusive classes, but populate the continuum between the two extremes (Bannard et al, 2003). $$$$$ The unique challenge posed by MWEs for empirical NLP is precisely that they do not fall cleanly into the binary classes of compositional and non-compositional expressions, but populate a continuum between the two extremes.

Bannard et al (2003) tested techniques using statistical models to infer the meaning of verb-particle constructions (VPCs), focus 2 In this lexicon, many MWEs are encoded as templates,. $$$$$ We then go on to report on the implementation of some techniques for using statistical models acquired from corpus data to infer the meaning of verb-particle constructions.
