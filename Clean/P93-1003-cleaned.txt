For instance, Kupiec (1993) uses statistical techniques and extracts bilingual noun phrases from parallel corpora tagged with terms. $$$$$ They can be used in bilingual concordances, for automatically constructing bilingual lexicons, and probabilistically quantified correspondences may be useful for statistical translation methods.

There is a long tradition of research into bilingual terminology extraction (Kupiec, 1993), (Gaussier, 1998). $$$$$ An Algorithm For Finding Noun Phrase Correspondences In Bilingual Corpora

Kupiec (1993) applied finite state transducer in his noun phrases recogniser for both English and French. $$$$$ The taggers provide part-of-speech categories which are used by finite-state recognizers to extract simple noun phrases for both languages.
Kupiec (1993) applied finite state transducer in his noun phrases recogniser for both English and French. $$$$$ Simple noun phrases (excluding pronouns and digits) are then extracted from the sentences by finite-state recognizers that are specified by regular expressions defined in terms of part-ofspeech categories.

Kupiec (1993) attempted to find noun phrase correspondences in parallel corpora using part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase recognition methods. $$$$$ The majority of errors that occur are not the result of incorrect tagging or noun phrase recognition, but are the result of the approximate nature of the correspondence model.

Kupiec (1993) also briefly mentions the use of finite state NP recognizers for both English and French to prepare the input for a program that identified the correspondences between NPs in bilingual corpora, but he does not directly discuss their performance. $$$$$ An Algorithm For Finding Noun Phrase Correspondences In Bilingual Corpora

We informally evaluated the MWE extraction tool following Kupiec (1993) by manually inspecting the mapping of the 100 most frequent terms. $$$$$ The term &quot;correspondence&quot; is used here to signify a mapping between words in two aligned sentences.

The plausible hypothesis that parallel sentences containing corresponding linguistic expressions is the major premise in Kupiec (1993). $$$$$ The words in sentences are first tagged with their corresponding part-of-speech categories.

Previous works that focus on multi-word translation correspondences from parallel corpora include noun phrase correspondences (Kupiec, 1993), fixed/flexiblecollocations (Smadja et al, 1996), n-gram word sequences of arbitrary length (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996), non-compositional compounds (Melamed, 2001), captoids (Moore, 2001), and named entities. $$$$$ An Algorithm For Finding Noun Phrase Correspondences In Bilingual Corpora

Kupiec (1993) focuses on noun-phrase translations only, Smadja et al (1996) limits to find French translation of English collocation identified by his Xtract system, and Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996) can exhaustively enumerate only rigid word sequences. $$$$$ Instances of the English collocation are found and the mutual information is calculated between the instances and various single word candidates in aligned French sentences.

Most bilingual terminology extraction systems first identify candidate terms in the source language based on predefined source patterns, and then select translation candidates for these terms in the target language (Kupiec, 1993). $$$$$ The prepositional phrase attaches to the noun phrase in one language and does not in the other.
