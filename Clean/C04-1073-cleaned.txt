Xia and McCord (2004) extracted reordering rules automatically from bilingual corpora for English-to-French translation; Collins et al (2005) used linguistically-motivated clause restructuring rules for German-to-English translation; Li et al (2007) modeled reordering on parse tree nodes by using a maximum entropy model with surface and syntactic features for Chinese-to-English translation; Katz-Brown and Collins (2008) applied a very simple reverse ordering to Japanese-to-English translation, which reversed the word order in Japanese segments separated by a few simple cues; Xu et al (2009) utilized a dependency parser with several hand-labeled precedence rules for re ordering English to subject-object-verb order like Korean and Japanese. $$$$$ 1 ndet la t det sg 2 subj France noun propn sg 3 top is verb vpres sg 4 ndet the det sg 5 nadj first adj 6 pred country noun cn sg 7 nadj western adj ?la t France is the first country western?

While our framework can be applied to any translation system in which it is possible to derive a token-level alignment from the input source tokens to the output target tokens, it is of particular practical interest when applied to a system that performs reordering as a preprocessing step (Xia and McCord, 2004). $$$$$ (a) sentence to be translated He  is  the first international student (b) part of the clump dictionary (c) one possible segmentation He        is   the   first       international      student (d) possible translations is => est,  the => le,  first => premier is the first => est le premier,   he => il international => international <>=.

Generally reordering rules are applied to the source language, but there have been attempts at target side reordering as well (Na et al, 2009). Reordering rules can be based on different levels of linguistic annotation, such as POS-tags (Niehues and Kolss, 2009), chunks (Zhang et al, 2007) or parse trees (Xia and McCord, 2004). $$$$$ p???H?v???U?=?j??v???

Preprocessing approaches can use either hand-written rules targeting known language differences (e.g. Collins et al (2005), Li et al (2009)), or automatically learnt rules (e.g. Xia and McCord (2004), Zhang et al (2007b)), which are basically language independent. $$$$$ p???H?v???U?=?j??v???

As a result, there is a large amount of previous research that handles the problem of reordering through the use of improved reordering models for phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al2005), hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2007), syntax-based translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001), or pre ordering (Xia and McCord, 2004). In particular, systems that use source language syntax allow for the handling of long distance reordering without large increases in The first author is now affiliated with the Nara Institute of Science and Technology. $$$$$ p???H?v???U?=?j??v???

Preprocessing approaches involving the use of a syntactic parse of the source sentence to change the word order to more closely match the word order of the target language have been studied by Niessen and Ney (2004), Xia and McCord (2004), Dra ?bek and Yarowsky (2004), Collins et al. $$$$$ (a) sentence to be translated He  is  the first international student (b) part of the clump dictionary (c) one possible segmentation He        is   the   first       international      student (d) possible translations is => est,  the => le,  first => premier is the first => est le premier,   he => il international => international <>=.
