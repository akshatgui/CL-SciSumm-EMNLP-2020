Existing methods for topic segmentation typically assume that fragments of text (e.g. sentences or sequences of words of a fixed length) with similar lexical distribution are about the same topic; the goal of these methods is to find the boundaries where the lexical distribution changes (e.g. Choi (2000), Malioutov and Barzilay (2006)). $$$$$ Existing work falls into one of two categories, lexical cohesion methods and multi-source methods (Yaari, 1997).
