(Brody and Lapata, 2009) apply such a model for word sense induction on a set of 35 target nouns. $$$$$ This served as our out-of-domain corpus, and contained approximately 730 thousand instances of the 35 target nouns in the Semeval lexical sample.

Tiered clustering is a discrete clustering method, as opposed to methods such as (Brody and Lapata, 2009) that assign a distribution of word senses to each word instance. $$$$$ Sense induction is thus typically viewed as an unsupervised clustering problem where the aim is to partition a word’s contexts into different classes, each representing a word sense.

This introduces the complication of choosing the right number of possible senses, hence a Bayesian approach to WSI was proposed which deals with this problem within a principled generative framework (Brody and Lapata, 2009). $$$$$ In this paper we adopt a novel Bayesian approach and formalize the induction problem in a generative model.
