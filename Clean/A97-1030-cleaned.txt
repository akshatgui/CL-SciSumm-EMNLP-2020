Since the introduction of this task in MUC-6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), numerous systems using various ways of exploiting entity-specific and local context features were proposed, from relatively simple character based models such as Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) and Klein et al (2003) to complex models making use of various lexical, syntactic ,morpho logical, and orthographical information, such as Wacholder et al (1997), Fleischman and Hovy (2002), and Florian et al (2003). $$$$$ Most proper name recognizers that have been reported on in print either take as input text tagged by part-of-speech (e.g., the systems of (Paik et al. 1993) and (Mani et al.

Ravin and Kazi (1999) further refined the method of solving co-reference through measuring context similarity and integrated it into Nominator (Wacholder et al, 1997), which was one of the first successful systems for named entity recognition and co-reference resolution. $$$$$ (See (Ravin and Wacholder 1996) for details.)

As Wacholder et al (1997) noted, it is fairly common for one of the mentions of an entity in a document to be a long, typical surface form of that entity (e.g., George W. Bush), while the other mentions are shorter surface forms (e.g., Bush). $$$$$ It is a fairly standard convention in an edited document for one of the first references to an entity (excluding a reference in the title) to include a relatively full form of its name.

Bush), while the other mentions are shorter surface forms (e.g., Bush). $$$$$ In a kind of discourse anaphora, other references to the entity take the form of shorter, more ambiguous variants.

 $$$$$ A reliable database provides both accuracy and efficiency, if fast look-up methods are incorporated.
 $$$$$ Because of these difficulties, we believe that for the forseeable future, practical applications to discover new names in text will continue to require the sort of human effort invested in Nominator.

We constructed a large, automatically annotated corpus by merging the output of Charniak's statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) with that of the IBM named entity recognition system Nominator (Wacholder et al,1997). $$$$$ Entity-type ambiguity is quite common, as places are named after famous people and companies are named after their owners or locations.

Approaches to this problem include Wacholder et al (1997), focusing on the variation of surface name for a given referent, and Smith and Crane (2002), resolving geographic name ambiguity. $$$$$ The man may refer to more than one male individual previously mentioned in the discourse or present in the non-linguistic context; J. Smith may similarly refer to more than one individual named Joseph Smith, John Smith, Jane Smith, etc.
