Given the fine-grained syntactic and semantic analysis of the HPSG grammar and its robustness (through SNLP integration), we decided to use the semantic representation (MRS, see (Copestake et al, 2001)) as additional input for IE. $$$$$ We have developed a framework for formally specifying semantics within constraint-based representations which allows semantic operations in a grammar to be tightly specified and which allows a representation of semantic content which is largely independent of the feature structure architecture of the syntactic representation.

The semantic representations used are flat semantic representations in the sense of [Copestake et al, 2001] and the semantic parameters (that is, the semantic indices representing the missing arguments of the semantic functors) are represented by unification variables. $$$$$ Some constraint-based grammar formalisms incorporate both syntactic and semantic representations within the same structure.

Recent work in semantic construction for HPSG (Copestake et al., 2001) supports our conjecture: the examples discussed there are compatible with our simplification. $$$$$ We can now define the following operation f over these denotations to create an algebra: Definition 5 Semantics of the Semantic Construction Algebra where G0 = {g : g(i1) = g(i02)} And this operation demonstrates that semantic construction is compositional: Theorem 2 Semantics of Semantic Construction is Compositional The mapping [] : hΣ, opi −→ hhI, I, Gi, fi is a homomorphism (so [op(a1, a2)] = f([a1], [a2])).

The original Grammar Matrix consisted of types defining the basic feature geometry, types associated with Minimal Recursion Semantics (e.g., (Copestake et al, 2001)), types for lexical and syntactic rules, and configuration files for the LKB grammar development environment (Copestake, 2002) and the PET system (Callmeier,2000). $$$$$ Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS: Copestake et al (1999), see also Egg (1998)) tightens up the specification of composition a little.

The Redwoods tree bank provides deeper semantics expressed in the Minimum Recursion Semantics formalism (Copestake et al, 2001), but in the present experiments we have not explored this fully. $$$$$ It is in many ways easier to work with than A-calculus based approaches (which we discuss further below) and has the great advantage of allowing generalizations about the syntax-semantics interface to be easily expressed.

The grammar is couched in the theoretical framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard; Sag 1994), with semantic representations in Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al 2001). $$$$$ For instance, although HPSG has the Semantics Principle (Pollard and Sag, 1994) this does not stop the composition process accessing arbitrary pieces of structure, so it is often not easy to conceptually disentangle the syntax and semantics in an HPSG.

Otherwise, composition strictly follows the semantic operations of the algebra of Copestake et al (2001): the composition rules only refer to the hook and slots of functors and arguments, to achieve the binding of argument variables and the encoding of scope constraints. $$$$$ We can assume that semantic composition always involves two arguments, since we can define composition in ternary rules etc as a sequence of binary operations.
