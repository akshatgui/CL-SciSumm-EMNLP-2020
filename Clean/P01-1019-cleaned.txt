Given the fine-grained syntactic and semantic analysis of the HPSG grammar and its robustness (through SNLP integration), we decided to use the semantic representation (MRS, see (Copestake et al, 2001)) as additional input for IE. $$$$$ We have developed a framework for formally specifying semantics within constraint-based representations which allows semantic operations in a grammar to be tightly specified and which allows a representation of semantic content which is largely independent of the feature structure architecture of the syntactic representation.

The semantic representations used are flat semantic representations in the sense of [Copestake et al, 2001] and the semantic parameters (that is, the semantic indices representing the missing arguments of the semantic functors) are represented by unification variables. $$$$$ Some constraint-based grammar formalisms incorporate both syntactic and semantic representations within the same structure.

The original Grammar Matrix consisted of types defining the basic feature geometry, types associated with Minimal Recursion Semantics (e.g., (Copestake et al, 2001)), types for lexical and syntactic rules, and configuration files for the LKB grammar development environment (Copestake, 2002) and the PET system (Callmeier,2000). $$$$$ Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS

The semantic interpretations are expressed using Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al, 2001), which provides the means to represent interpretations with a flat, underspecified semantics using terms of the predicate calculus and generalized quantifiers. $$$$$ Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS

The grammar is couched in the theoretical framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard; Sag 1994), with semantic representations in Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al 2001). $$$$$ For instance, although HPSG has the Semantics Principle (Pollard and Sag, 1994) this does not stop the composition process accessing arbitrary pieces of structure, so it is often not easy to conceptually disentangle the syntax and semantics in an HPSG.

Otherwise, composition strictly follows the semantic operations of the algebra of Copestake et al (2001) $$$$$ We can assume that semantic composition always involves two arguments, since we can define composition in ternary rules etc as a sequence of binary operations.
Otherwise, composition strictly follows the semantic operations of the algebra of Copestake et al (2001) $$$$$ HPSGs can be written which encode much of the algebra described here as constraints on types in the grammar, thus ensuring that the grammar is consistent with the rules on composition.

An MRS consists of a bag of labeled elementary predicates and their arguments, a list of scoping constraints, and a pair of relations that provide a hook into the representation - a label, which must outscope all the handles, and an index (Copestake et al, 2001). $$$$$ The third element (the lzt) is a bag of elementary predications Intuitively, the hook is a record of the value in the semantic entity that can be used to fill a hole in another entity during composition.
