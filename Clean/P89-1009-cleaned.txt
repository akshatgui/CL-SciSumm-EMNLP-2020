Full brevity, the strongest interpretation, is underlying Dale's algorithm (Dale, 1989), which produces a description entailing the minimal number of attributes possible, at the price of suffering NP-hard complexity. $$$$$ Suppose, also, that the domain includes a number of attributes (a I, a~, and so on), and that each attribute has a number of permissible values {v,,t, v,,2, and so on}; and that each entity is described by a set of attribute- value pairs.

Two other interpretations, the Greedy heuristic interpretation (Dale, 1989) and the local brevity interpretation (Reiter, 1990a) lead to algorithms that have polynomial complexity in the same order of magnitude. $$$$$ In order to permit the representation f enti- ties such as these, EPICURE makes use of a notion of a generalized physical object or physob].

Based on the Gricean Quantity maxim (Grice, 1975), and originally discussed by Appelt (1985), and further by Dale (1989), Reiter (1990) and Gardent (2002), this principle holds that descriptions should contain no more information than is necessary to distinguish an intended referent. $$$$$ The p~nciple of adequacy requires that a referring ex- pression should identify the intended referent un- ambiguously, and provide sufficient information to serve the purpose of the reference; and the princi- ple of e~ciency, pulling in the opposite direction, requires that the referring expression used must not contain more information than is necessary for the task at hand.

In ASGRE, this has been translated into a criterion which determines the adequacy of an attribute set, implemented in its most straightforward form in Full Brevity algorithms which select the smallest attribute set that uniquely refers to the intended referent (Dale, 1989). $$$$$ A mini- mal distinguishing description is then a set of such attribute-value pairs, where the cardinality of that set is such that there are no other sets of attribute- value pairs of lesser cardinality which are sufficient to distinguish the intended referent.

Due to its hill climbing nature, the IA avoids combinatorial search, unlike some predecessors which searched exhaustively for the briefest possible description of a referent (Dale, 1989), based on a strict interpretation of the GriceanMaxim of Quantity (Grice, 1975). $$$$$ In EPICURE, the process of constructing a description is driven by two principles, very like Gricean conversational maxims (Grice 1975).

Since the system knows which nodes in the semantic graph have already been mentioned it would also be possible to configure an external call to a GRE system (Dale, 1989) an application which infers the content of a referring expression given the current semantic context. $$$$$ From the deep semantic structure, a surface semantic structure is then constructed.
