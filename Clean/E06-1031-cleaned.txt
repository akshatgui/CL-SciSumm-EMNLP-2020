Others try to accommodate both syntactic and lexical differences between the candidate translation and the reference, like CDER (Leusch et al, 2006), which employs a version of edit distance for word substitution and reordering; METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), which uses stemming and WordNet synonymy; and a linear regression model developed by (Russo-Lassner et al., 2005), which makes use of stemming, Word Net synonymy, verb class synonymy, matching noun phrase heads, and proper name matching. $$$$$ An implementation of both approaches at the same time can be found in TER by (Snover et al., 2005).

Meteor, as well as several other proposed metrics such as GTM (Melamed et al, 2003), TER (Snover et al, 2006) and CDER (Leusch et al, 2006) aim to address some of these weaknesses. $$$$$ An implementation of both approaches at the same time can be found in TER by (Snover et al., 2005).

The CDER measure (Leusch et al, 2006) is based on edit distance, such as the well-known WER, but allows reordering of blocks. $$$$$ It is based on edit distance – such as the well-known word error rate (WER) – but allows for reordering of blocks.
The CDER measure (Leusch et al, 2006) is based on edit distance, such as the well-known WER, but allows reordering of blocks. $$$$$ WER, which is based on Levenshtein distance, penalizes the reordering of blocks even more heavily.

For the past decade, the task of measuring the performance of MT systems has relied heavily on lexical n-gram based MT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), NIST (Doddington, 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), PER (Tillmann et al, 1997), CDER (Leusch et al, 2006) and WER (Nieen et al, 2000) because of their support on fast and inexpensive evaluation. $$$$$ State-of-the-art measures such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or NIST (Doddington, 2002) aim at measuring the translation quality rather on the document level1 than on the level of single sentences.

In addition to the widely used BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) scores, we also evaluate translation quality with the recently proposed Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and four edit-distance style metrics, Word Error Rate (WER), Position independent word Error Rate (PER) (Tillmann et al., 1997), CDER, which allows block reordering (Leusch et al, 2006), and Translation Edit Rate (TER) (Snover et al, 2006). $$$$$ In this, the new measure differs significantly from the position independent error rate (PER) by (Tillmann et al., 1997).
