The Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) system uses features extracted from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) corresponding to the features that were used by G&J and G&P systems. $$$$$ In the CCG version, we replace the features above with corresponding features based on both the sentence’s CCG derivation tree (shown in Figure 1) and the CCG predicate-argument relations extracted from it (shown in Table 1).

This analysis allows recovery of verbal arguments of nominalised raising and control verbs, a construction which both Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) and Boxwell and White (2008) identify as a problem case when aligning Propbank and CCGbank. $$$$$ Figure 1 shows the derivations of an ordinary sentence, a relative clause and a right-node-raising construction.
This analysis allows recovery of verbal arguments of nominalised raising and control verbs, a construction which both Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) and Boxwell and White (2008) identify as a problem case when aligning Propbank and CCGbank. $$$$$ These relations are recovered with an accuracy of around 83% (labeled recovery) or 91% (unlabeled recovery) (Hockenmaier, 2003).

Conventionally there are two kinds of methods for role assignments, one is using only statistical information (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) and the other is combining with grammar rules (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003). $$$$$ In previous work using the PropBank corpus, Gildea and Palmer (2002) developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of Collins (1999).

Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) report that using features extracted from a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) representation improves semantic labeling performance on core arguments. $$$$$ Identifying Semantic Roles Using Combinatory Categorial Grammar
Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) report that using features extracted from a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) representation improves semantic labeling performance on core arguments. $$$$$ We compare a parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b) with the Collins parser.

However, this mismatch is significantly less than the 23% mismatch reported in (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) between the CCGBank and an earlier version of the PropBank. $$$$$ In our training data, 77% of PropBank arguments corresponded directly to a relation in the CCG predicate-argument representation, and the path feature was used for the remaining 23%.
However, this mismatch is significantly less than the 23% mismatch reported in (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) between the CCGBank and an earlier version of the PropBank. $$$$$ Because of the mismatch between the constituent structures of CCG and the Treebank, we score both systems according to how well they identify the head words of PropBank’s arguments.

In order to generalize the path feature (see Table 1 in Section 3) which is probably the most salient (while being the most data sparse) feature for SRL, previous work has extracted features from other syntactic representations, such as CCG derivations (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) and dependency trees (Hacioglu, 2004) or integrated features from different parsers (Pradhan et al, 2005b). $$$$$ In this paper, we examine how the syntactic representations used by different statistical parsers affect the performance of such a system.

For instance, Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) reported that a CCG-based parser gives improved results over the Collins parser. $$$$$ We compare a parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b) with the Collins parser.
For instance, Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) reported that a CCG-based parser gives improved results over the Collins parser. $$$$$ The CCG-based system outperforms the system based on the Collins parser on these core arguments, and has comparable performance when all PropBank labels are considered.

As with a previous approach in CCG semantic role labeling (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003), this feature shows the exact nature of the syntactic dependency between the predicate and the word we are considering, if any such dependency exists. $$$$$ The head word is a lexical feature, and provides information about the semantic type of the role filler.
As with a previous approach in CCG semantic role labeling (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003), this feature shows the exact nature of the syntactic dependency between the predicate and the word we are considering, if any such dependency exists. $$$$$ The parse tree path feature, designed to capture grammatical relations between constituents, is replaced with a feature defined as follows: If there is a dependency in the predicate-argument structure of the CCG derivation between two words w and w', the path feature from w to w' is defined as the lexical category of the functor, the argument slot i occupied by the argument, plus an arrow (← or →) to indicate whether w or w' is the categorial functor.

We also compare with the CCG-based SRL presented in (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) , which has a similar motivation as this paper, except they use the Combinatory Categorial Grammar formalism and the CCGBank syntactic Treebank which was converted from the Penn Tree bank. $$$$$ Identifying Semantic Roles Using Combinatory Categorial Grammar

As a result they show that the oracle f-score improves by over 2 points over the (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) oracle results for the numbered arguments only (A0,..., A5). $$$$$ We refer to PropBank’s numbered arguments as “core” arguments.
As a result they show that the oracle f-score improves by over 2 points over the (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) oracle results for the numbered arguments only (A0,..., A5). $$$$$ In Table 2, “core” indicates results on PropBank’s numbered arguments (ARG0...ARG5) only, and “all” includes numbered arguments as well as the ArgM roles.

In contrast to the approach in (Punyakanok et al, 2008), which tags constituents directly, we tag headwords and then associate them with a constituent, as in a previous CCG-based approach (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003). $$$$$ The probabilities P(ri

This feature has been shown (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) to be an effective substitute for tree path-based features. $$$$$ It is defined as the path from the predicate through the parse tree to the constituent in question, represented as a string of parse tree nonterminals linked by symbols indicating upward or downward movement through the tree, as shown in Figure 2.

We follow a previous CCG based approach (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) in using a feature to describe the PARG relationship between the two words, if one exists. $$$$$ In previous work using the PropBank corpus, Gildea and Palmer (2002) developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of Collins (1999).
We follow a previous CCG based approach (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) in using a feature to describe the PARG relationship between the two words, if one exists. $$$$$ If two words do not stand in a predicate-argument relation, the CCG system takes recourse to the path feature.

Using a version of Brutus incorporating only the CCG-based features described above, we achieve better results than a previous CCG based system (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003, henceforth G&H). $$$$$ In the CCG version, we replace the features above with corresponding features based on both the sentence’s CCG derivation tree (shown in Figure 1) and the CCG predicate-argument relations extracted from it (shown in Table 1).
