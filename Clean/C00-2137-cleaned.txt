The best F score and WER are obtained using the combination of all three dictionaries, HB-dict+GHM-dict+S-dict. Furthermore, the difference between the results using HB-dict+GHM-dict+S-dict and HB-dict+GHMdict is statistically significant (p 0.01), based on the computationally-intensive Monte Carlo method of Yeh (2000), demonstrating the contribution of Sdict. $$$$$ The results on the test; set, are: Method ~ ~  Precision F-score t i _l_556t  I 49.5% 47.5% Zl: 64.1% 35.2% Two questions being tested are whether the ap- parent ilnt)rovement in reca.ll and F-score f!rom using method I is significant.
