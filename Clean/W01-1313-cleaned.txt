These numbers compare favorably with the previous literature $$$$$ Mani and Wilson (2000) point out “over half of the errors [made by his time-stamper] were due to propagation of spreading of an incorrect event time to neighboring events”.
These numbers compare favorably with the previous literature $$$$$ The most relevant prior work is (Mani and Wilson, 2000), who implemented their system on news stories, introduced rules spreading time-stamps obtained with the help of explicit temporal expressions throughout the whole article, and invented machine learning rules for disambiguating between specific and generic use of temporal expressions (for example, whether Christmas is used to denote the 25th of December or to denote some period of time around the 25th of December).

Filatova and Hovy (2001) also explore temporal linking with events, but do not assume that events and time stamps have been provided by an external process. $$$$$ Though it seems most logical to recapitulate events in the order in which they happened, i.e. in chronological order, the events are often presented in a different sequence”.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) also explore temporal linking with events, but do not assume that events and time stamps have been provided by an external process. $$$$$ Our approach is to break the news stories into their constituent events and to assign timestamps—either time-points or time-intervals—to these events.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ Assigning Time-Stamps To Event-Clauses
Filatova and Hovy (2001) assign time stamps to clauses in which an event is mentioned. $$$$$ Such clauses are treated as one event and only one time-point will be assigned to them.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit temporal expressions within a text and apply this information throughout the whole article, assigning activity times to all clauses. $$$$$ Assigning Time-Stamps To Event-Clauses
Filatova and Hovy (2001) also process explicit temporal expressions within a text and apply this information throughout the whole article, assigning activity times to all clauses. $$$$$ There are many constraints on temporal expressions in this domain.

Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ When assigning a time to an event, we select the time to be either the most recently assigned date or, if the value of the most recently assigned date is undefined, to the date of the article.
Filatova and Hovy (2001) infer time values based on the most recently assigned date or the date of the article. $$$$$ If there is no verb in the event-clause then the most recently assigned date (or the date of the article) is assigned to the event-clause.

 $$$$$ This research can greatly improve the performance of time-stamper and might lead to a list of machine learning rules for time detection.
 $$$$$ In this paper we made an attempt to not just analyze and decode temporal expressions but to apply this analysis throughout the whole text and assign time-stamps to such type of clauses, which later could be used as separate sentences in various natural language applications, for example in multidocument summarization. text number of manually number of time point percentage of number created event-clauses correctly assigned to correct manually created clauses assignment target 1 7 6 85.71 target 2 27 20 74.07 target 3 5 4 80.00 target 4 28 26 92.85 target 5 33 30 90.91 target 6 58 37 63.79 Total 158 123 77.85
