Consider, for example, the following sentence, taken from the Hansard corpus of the proceedings of the Canadian parliament [Brown et al 1988]: (1) They know full well that the companies held tax money aside for collection later on the b~sis that the government said it was going to collect it. $$$$$ I l l  particular, we have chosen to work with the English and French languages because we were able to obtain the biqingual l lansard corpus of proceedings of the Canadian parliament containing 30 million words of text [8].

Parallel corpora have received a lot of attention since the advent of statistical machine translation (Brown et al, 1988) where they serve as training material for the underlying alignment models. $$$$$ Carry out steps 1 and 2 for all sentence pairs of tile training text.

The most successful translation models that are found in the literature exploit finite-state machinery. The approach started with the so-called IBM models (Brown et al, 1988), implementing a set of elementary operations, such as movement, duplication and translation, that independently act on individual words in the source sentence. $$$$$ The steps of the proposed translation process are: (1) Partition the source text into a set of fixed locutioris.

Developing a better TM is a fundamental issue for those applica tions. Researchers at IBM first described such a statistical TM in (Brown et al, 1988). $$$$$ Fundamental to the technique is a complex glossary of correspondence of fixed locutions.

Most algorithms for bilingual word alignment to date have been based on the probabilistic translation models first proposed by Brown et al (1988, 1990), especially Model I and Model 2. $$$$$ Our procedure will be based on a model (an admittedly crude one) of how Ertgtish words are generated from their French counterparts.

In the field of eomputationa.1 linguistics, mutual information [Brown et al, 1988],  2 [Church and Hanks, 1990], or a likelihood ratio test [Dunning, 199a] are suggested. $$$$$ The above normalization may seem arbitrary, but it has a sound underpinning from the field of Information Theory [ 10].

In general a statistical machine translation system is composed of three components: a language model, a translation model, and a decoder (Brown et al, 1988). The language model tells how probable a given sentence is in the source language, the translation model indicates how likely it is that a particular target sentence is a translation of a given source sentence, and the decoder is what actually takes a source sentence as input and produces its translation as output. $$$$$ While the only way to refute the many weighty objections to our ideas woukl be to construct a machine that actually carries out satisfactory translation, some mitigating comments are ill order, 7 l We do not hope to partition uniquely the source sentence into locutions.

This is the task of finding for a word in one language words of a similar meaning in a second language. The results of this can be used to aid manual construction of resources or directly aid translation. This task was first approached as a distributional similarity-like problem by Brown et al (1988). $$$$$ Our approach eschews the use of an internmdiate ,nechalfism (language) that would encode the "meaning" of tile source text.
