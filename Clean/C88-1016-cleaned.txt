Consider, for example, the following sentence, taken from the Hansard corpus of the proceedings of the Canadian parliament [Brown et al 1988] $$$$$ I l l  particular, we have chosen to work with the English and French languages because we were able to obtain the biqingual l lansard corpus of proceedings of the Canadian parliament containing 30 million words of text [8].

Parallel corpora have received a lot of attention since the advent of statistical machine translation (Brown et al, 1988) where they serve as training material for the underlying alignment models. $$$$$ Carry out steps 1 and 2 for all sentence pairs of tile training text.

The most successful translation models that are found in the literature exploit finite-state machinery. The approach started with the so-called IBM models (Brown et al, 1988), implementing a set of elementary operations, such as movement, duplication and translation, that independently act on individual words in the source sentence. $$$$$ The steps of the proposed translation process are

Developing a better TM is a fundamental issue for those applica tions. Researchers at IBM first described such a statistical TM in (Brown et al, 1988). $$$$$ Fundamental to the technique is a complex glossary of correspondence of fixed locutions.

Researchers at IBM first described such a statistical TM in (Brown et al, 1988). $$$$$ Forttmately, the difficulty can be alleviated by use of itcrative re-estimation, which is a technique that starts out by guessing the values of unknown quantities and gradually re-adjusts them so as to account better and better for given data [ 11 ].

Most algorithms for bilingual word alignment to date have been based on the probabilistic translation models first proposed by Brown et al (1988, 1990), especially Model I and Model 2. $$$$$ Our procedure will be based on a model (an admittedly crude one) of how Ertgtish words are generated from their French counterparts.

In the field of eomputationa.1 linguistics, mutual information [Brown et al, 1988],  2 [Church and Hanks, 1990], or a likelihood ratio test [Dunning, 199a] are suggested. $$$$$ The above normalization may seem arbitrary, but it has a sound underpinning from the field of Information Theory [ 10].

In general a statistical machine translation system is composed of three components $$$$$ While the only way to refute the many weighty objections to our ideas woukl be to construct a machine that actually carries out satisfactory translation, some mitigating comments are ill order, 7 l We do not hope to partition uniquely the source sentence into locutions.
In general a statistical machine translation system is composed of three components $$$$$ Laying aside for the time being the desirability of (idiomatic) word cluster - to - word cluster translation, what we areafter at first is to find for each word f in the (French) source language the list of words {e~, e2 ..... e,} of the (English) target language into which f can translate, and the probability P(e, I f  ) that such a translation takes place.

This is the task of finding for a word in one language words of a similar meaning in a second language. The results of this can be used to aid manual construction of resources or directly aid translation. This task was first approached as a distributional similarity-like problem by Brown et al (1988). $$$$$ Our approach eschews the use of an internmdiate ,nechalfism (language) that would encode the "meaning" of tile source text.
