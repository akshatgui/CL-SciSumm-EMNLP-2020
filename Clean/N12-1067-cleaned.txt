Dahlmeier and Ng (2012) propose an alternative evaluation scheme which, along with other properties, overcomes this by operating in terms of tokens rather than character offsets. $$$$$ The character edit offsets are automatically converted to token offsets.
Dahlmeier and Ng (2012) propose an alternative evaluation scheme which, along with other properties, overcomes this by operating in terms of tokens rather than character offsets. $$$$$ Character offsets make the evaluation procedure very brittle as a small change, e.g., an additional whitespace character, will affect all subsequent edits.

Unlike evaluating grammar error correction systems (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012), correction detection cannot refer to a gold standard. $$$$$ We present a novel method for evaluating grammatical error correction.

 $$$$$ By performing a simple breadth-first search, similar to the Viterbi algorithm, we can extract the lattice of all shortest paths that lead from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the Levenshtein matrix.

In order to overcome this problem, the Max Match (M2) scorer was proposed in (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b). $$$$$ In this work, we propose a method, called MaxMatch (M2), to overcome this problem.
In order to overcome this problem, the Max Match (M2) scorer was proposed in (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012b). $$$$$ We can see that the M2 scorer results in higher scores than the official scorer for all systems, showing that the official scorer missed some valid edits.
