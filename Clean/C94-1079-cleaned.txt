It is based on Principar, which is described in Lin (1994). $$$$$ Principle-based grammars, such as Govern- ment-Binding (GB) theory (Chomsky, 1981; Haegeman, 1991), offer many advantages over rule-based and unification-based grammars, such as the universality ofprinciples and mod- ularity of components in the grammar.

For the algorithm discussed in Section 4.1, we derived our descriptive properties using the output of the dependency analysis generated by the Minipar (Lin, 1994) dependency parser. $$$$$ Therefore, only (a) is output as the parse tree of the sentence.

 $$$$$ At that point, the initial message for the next lexical item is fed into the network.

Widely used dependency parsers which generate deep dependency representations include Minipar (Lin, 1994), which uses a declarative grammar, and the Stanford parser (Levy and Manning, 2004), which performs a conversion from a standard phrase-structure parse. $$$$$ The structure of the parse forest is similar to (Billot and Long, 1989) and (Tomita, 1986), but extended to include attribute values.
