Another recent method that has been proposed for training sequence models with constraints is Chang et al (2007). $$$$$ It is shown there that the improvement on the training examples via the constraints indeed boosts the learned model and the proposed method significantly outperforms the traditional semi-supervised framework.

Chang et al propose constraint-driven learning (CODL, Chang et al, 2007) which can be interpreted as a variation of self-training: Instances are selected for supervision based not only on the model's prediction, but also on their consistency with a set of user-defined constraints. $$$$$ Guiding Semi-Supervision with Constraint-Driven Learning
