This is implemented by Resnik and described in detail in [Resnik, 1999], calculates the similarity between all the words' senses of words in a set. $$$$$ The most recent end-product is an automatically acquired parallel corpus comprising 2491 English-French document pairs, approximately 1.5 million words per language.

Finally, I show that this algorithm performs competitively with the approach of Resnik (1999), in which only Association for Computational Linguistics. $$$$$ The candidate generation stage is followed by a candidate evaluation stage that represents the core of the approach, filtering out bad candidates from the set of generated page pairs.

The STRAND system (Resnik, 1999), for example, uses structural markup information from the pages, without looking at their content, to attempt to align them. $$$$$ Although the majority of Web content is in English, it also shows great promise as a source of multilingual content.

These were the same pairs for which human evaluations were carried out by Resnik (1999). $$$$$ The value of N is the number of pairs that were included, after excluding those for which the human judgement in the comparison was undecided.
These were the same pairs for which human evaluations were carried out by Resnik (1999). $$$$$ Moreover, at least for the confidently judged cases, STRAND is in agreement with the combined human judgment more often than the human judges agree with each other.

The STRAND scores are similar to those published by Resnik (1999). $$$$$ This section is a brief summary of the STRAND system and previously reported preliminary results (Resnik, 1998).
The STRAND scores are similar to those published by Resnik (1999). $$$$$ It employs a structural recognition algorithm exploiting the fact that Web pages in parallel translation are invariably very similar in the way they are structured — hence the 's' in STRAND.

It is capable of pulling parallel texts out of a large multilingual collection, and it rivals the performance of structure-based approaches to pair classification (Resnik, 1999), having better agreement with human judges. $$$$$ The problem is potentially acute if the generation stage happens to yield up many pairs of pages that come from online catalogues or other Web sites having large numbers of pages with a conventional structure.

Resnik (1999) addressed the issue of language identification for finding Web pages in the languages of interest. $$$$$ Language identification is performed on the plain-text versions of the pages.
Resnik (1999) addressed the issue of language identification for finding Web pages in the languages of interest. $$$$$ In the process, it was discovered that the most lightweight use of language identification, restricted to just the the language pair of interest, needed to be revised in favor of a strategy that includes identification over a wide range of languages.

The lack of large-scale parallel corpora no doubt has impeded progress in this direction, although attempts have been made to mine parallel corpora from the Web (Resnik, 1999). $$$$$ Resnik (1998) presented an algorithm called STRAND (Structural Translation Recognition for Acquiring Natural Data) designed to explore the Web as a source of parallel text, demonstrating its potential with a small-scale evaluation based on the author's judgments.
The lack of large-scale parallel corpora no doubt has impeded progress in this direction, although attempts have been made to mine parallel corpora from the Web (Resnik, 1999). $$$$$ However, I presume that if the number M of translation pairs on the Web is large, then half of M is also large.

First, parallel corpora, especially accurately aligned parallel corpora are rare, although attempts have been made to mine them from the Web (Resnik, 1999). $$$$$ STRAND (Resnik, 1998) is a languageindependent system for automatic discovery of text in parallel translation on the World Wide Web.
First, parallel corpora, especially accurately aligned parallel corpora are rare, although attempts have been made to mine them from the Web (Resnik, 1999). $$$$$ A second natural direction is the application of Web-based parallel text in applications such as lexical acquisition and cross-language information retrieval — especially since a sideeffect of the core STRAND algorithm is aligned &quot;chunks&quot;, i.e. non-markup segments found to correspond to each other based on alignment of the markup.

Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the web to generate corpora for languages where electronic resources are scarce, while Resnik (1999) describes a method for mining the web for bilingual texts. $$$$$ Mining The Web For Bilingual Text
Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the web to generate corpora for languages where electronic resources are scarce, while Resnik (1999) describes a method for mining the web for bilingual texts. $$$$$ Inspection of Web sites — those with bilingual text identified by STRAND and those without — suggests that the strategy of using Altavista to generate candidate pairs could be improved upon significantly by adding a true Web crawler to &quot;mine&quot; sites where bilingual text is known to be available, e.g. sites uncovered by a first pass of the system using the Altavista engine.

 $$$$$ The number inside the chunk token is the length of the text chunk, not counting whitespace; from this point on only the length of the text chunks is used, and therefore the structural filtering algorithm is completely language independent.
 $$$$$ Preliminary experiments using even small amounts of these data suggest that standard techniques, such as cross-language lexical association, can uncover useful data.

Resnik (1999) mined comparable corpora on the assumption that the pages which are comparable of each other share a similar structure (headers, paragraphs, etc.) when text is presented in many languages in the Web. $$$$$ Resnik (1998) presented an algorithm called STRAND (Structural Translation Recognition for Acquiring Natural Data) designed to explore the Web as a source of parallel text, demonstrating its potential with a small-scale evaluation based on the author's judgments.

Grefenstette (1999) used the Web for example-based ma chine translation; Kilgarriff (2001) investigated the type of noise in Web data; Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) used it as an additional resource for word sense disambiguation; Resnik (1999) mined the Web for bilingual texts; Turney (2001) used Web frequency counts to compute information retrieval-based mutual-information scores. $$$$$ Mining The Web For Bilingual Text

Mining the Web for bilingual text (Resnik, 1999) is not likely to provide sufficient quantities of high quality data. $$$$$ Mining The Web For Bilingual Text
Mining the Web for bilingual text (Resnik, 1999) is not likely to provide sufficient quantities of high quality data. $$$$$ I would conjecture that for English-French there is an order of magnitude more bilingual text on the Web than that uncovered in this early stage of research.

For example, Table 5 shows the abstract of Resnik (1999) and 5 selected sentences that cite it in AAN. $$$$$ For example, see Figure 2.
For example, Table 5 shows the abstract of Resnik (1999) and 5 selected sentences that cite it in AAN. $$$$$ The table also shows Cohen's lc, an agreement measure that corrects for chance agreement (Carletta, 1996); the most important value in the table is the value of 0.7 for the two human judges, which can be interpreted as sufficiently high to indicate that the task is reasonably well defined.

Many research ideas have exploited the Web in unsupervised or weakly supervised algorithms for natural language processing (e.g., Resnik (1999)). $$$$$ Text in parallel translation is a valuable resource in natural language processing.

In Resnik (1999), the Web is harvested in search of pages that are available in two languages, with the aim of building parallel corpora for any pair of target languages. $$$$$ Exploration of the Web suggests that parent pages and sibling pages cover the major relationships between parallel translations on the Web.
