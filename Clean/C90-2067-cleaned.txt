Another related line of work is the word sense disambiguation algorithm proposed in (Veronis and Ide, 1990), where a large neural network is built by relating words through their dictionary definitions. $$$$$ In this paper, we describe a means for automatically building very large neural networks (VLNNs) from definition texts in machine-readable dictionaries, and demonslrate he use of these networks for word sense disambiguation.

Current set of semantic relation types m MindNet These relation types may be contrasted with simple co-occurrence statistics used to create network structures from dictionaries by researchers including Veronis and Ide (1990), Kozima and Furugori (1993), and Wilks et al (1996). $$$$$ However, with one word as a basis, the relation is tenuous and wholly dependent upon a particular dictionary's wording.

Since the model estimation has been reduced to simple update calculations, the proposed model is similar to conventional spreading activation approaches, which have been applied, for example, to word sense disambiguation (Veronis and Ide, 1990). $$$$$ Our method brings together two earlier, independent approaches to word sense disambiguation
