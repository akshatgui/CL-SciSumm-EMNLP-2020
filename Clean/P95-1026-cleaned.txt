In comparison, (Yarowsky, 1995) achieved 91.4% correct performance, using 1380 contexts and the dictionary definitions in training. $$$$$ Remarkably good performance may be achieved by identifying a single defining collocate for each class (e.g. bird and machine for the word crane), and using for seeds only those contexts containing one of these words.

Another line of research is to pick up some high-quality auto-parsed training instances from unlabeled data using bootstrapping methods, such as self-training (Yarowsky, 1995), co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), and tri-training (Zhou and Li, 2005). $$$$$ The training sets (e.g.

This heuristic naturally reflects the broadly known assumption about lexical ambiguity presented in (Yarowsky, 1995), namely the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic. $$$$$ For these words, the table below measures the claim's accuracy (when the word occurs more than once in a discourse, how often it takes on the majority sense for the discourse) and applicability (how often the word does occur more than once in a discourse).
This heuristic naturally reflects the broadly known assumption about lexical ambiguity presented in (Yarowsky, 1995), namely the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic. $$$$$ They have been displaced by more broadly applicable collocations that better partition the newly learned classes.

This heuristic mimes the one-sense-per collocation heuristic presented in (Yarowsky, 1995). $$$$$ The algorithm is based on two powerful constraints — that words tend to have one sense per discourse and one sense per collocation — exploited in an iterative bootstrapping procedure.

Many of these tasks have been addressed in other fields, for example, hypothesis verification in the field of machine translation (Tran et al, 1996), sense disambiguation in speech synthesis (Yarowsky, 1995), and relation tagging in information retrieval (Marsh and Perzanowski, 1999). $$$$$ For example:

The idea of sense consistency was first introduced and extended to operate across related documents by (Yarowsky, 1995). $$$$$ In brief, if several instances of the polysemous word in a discourse have already been assigned SENSE-A, this sense tag may be extended to all examples in the discourse, conditional on the relative numbers and the probabilities associated with the tagged examples.

The well-known observation that words rarely exhibit more than one sense per discourse (Yarowsky, 1995) implies that features closely associated with a particular sense have a low probability of appearing in the same document as features associated with another sense. $$$$$ The observation that words strongly tend to exhibit only one sense in a given discourse or document was stated and quantified in Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992).

For the fine-grained track, it achieves 2nd place after that of Tugwell and Kilgarriff (2001), which used a decision list (Yarowsky, 1995) on manually selected corpora evidence for each inventory sense, and thus is not subject to loss of distinguishability in the glosses as Lesk variants are. $$$$$ In general, the decision-list algorithm is well suited for the task of sense disambiguation and will be used as a component of the unsupervised algorithm below.
