Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ Also, it is unlikely that an incorrect normalization will contract any associations at all, especially in view of the fact that these forms, because they normalize several original forms, tend to occur more often.
Word forms are treated as instances of one and the same word if either their actual or normalised forms are equal (Kay and Roscheisen,1993). $$$$$ In particular, both must occur as prefixes and suffixes of other forms.

The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ In particular, both must occur as prefixes and suffixes of other forms.
The morphology algorithm proposed by Kay and Roscheisen (1993) is applied for splitting potential suffixes and prefixes and for obtaining the normalised word forms. $$$$$ First a data structure, called the trie, is constructed in which information about the occurrences of potential prefixes and suffixes in the text is stored.

Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ The growing interest in the possibility of automatically aligning Large texts is attested to by independent work that has been done on it since the first description of our methods was made available (Kay and Roscheisen 1988).
Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment. $$$$$ Sentence Alignment Table (SAT).

Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ Another example is the completely automatic, statistical approach to translation taken by the research group at IBM (Brown et al. 1990), which takes a large corpus of text with aligned translations as its point of departure.
Several automatic sentence alignment approaches have been proposed based on sentence length (Brown et al, 1991) and lexical information (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993). $$$$$ In Section 5 we discuss other approaches to the alignment problem that were subsequently undertaken by other researchers (Gale and Church 1991; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).
