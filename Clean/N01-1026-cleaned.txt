(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) aim at pos tagging a target language corpus using English pos tags as well as estimation of lexical priors. $$$$$ Section 4.2.2 will discuss the estimation of P(tilti-i)• The following section describes the estimation of P(tiiwi), which using Bayes rule and direct (relatively noise-free) measurement of P(w) from the French data, can be used to calculate P(wiiti) as

Having said this, we follow in principle the algorithm proposed by (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) to estimate lexical priors. $$$$$ The major reason for estimating the lexical priors and tag sequence model separately is that a tag sequence bigram (or even trigram) model has far fewer parameters than the lexical prior model and thus can be estimated on a very conservatively chosen set of filtered, high confidence alignment data.
Having said this, we follow in principle the algorithm proposed by (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) to estimate lexical priors. $$$$$ After the lexical prior models have been trained (as above), sentences are also tested to identify those where the directly projected tag sequence (from the automatic alignments) is closely compatible with the estimated lexical prior probabilities for each word.

However, as was noted by (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), most words tend to have at most two pos. $$$$$ NNS(,), Table 1 shows the observed frequency distributions of English tags projected onto four French words from 1-to-1 alignments, for the core N/V/J/R/I POS tags.
However, as was noted by (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), most words tend to have at most two pos. $$$$$ Given the lower frequency of most content words, the potential risks of using these 1-to-n alignments are greater, but so are the benefits given that the 1-to-1 alignments tend to be both sparse and somewhat biased.

(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) propose the same algorithm as the one proposed here for their estimation of lexical priors, with the exception that they use automatic word alignments rather than our extraction algorithm for finding corresponding words. $$$$$ After the lexical prior models have been trained (as above), sentences are also tested to identify those where the directly projected tag sequence (from the automatic alignments) is closely compatible with the estimated lexical prior probabilities for each word.

As for (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) estimating lexical priors is merely an intermediate step, they do not report evaluation results for this step. $$$$$ The major reason for estimating the lexical priors and tag sequence model separately is that a tag sequence bigram (or even trigram) model has far fewer parameters than the lexical prior model and thus can be estimated on a very conservatively chosen set of filtered, high confidence alignment data.

Moreover, the success of joint bilingual learning may lend itself to many inherent multilingual NLP tasks such as POS tagging (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), name entity recognition (Yarowsky et al, 2001). $$$$$ Inducing Multilingual POS Taggers And NP Bracketers Via Robust Projection Across Aligned Corpora

Our work is closest to that of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001), but differs in two important ways. $$$$$ This further motivates the noise-robust training and stand-alone application of our current work.

This can be seen as a rough approximation of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001). $$$$$ A stand-alone POS tagger applicable to new data can be used to improve statistical MT translation models, both by supporting finer translation model granularity (e.g. wind/NN modeled distinctly from wind/VB), and by serving as a source of backoff alignment probabilities for previously unseen words.

Given that we have a parallel corpus where the German side overtly realizes T and V, this is a classical case of annotation projection (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001). $$$$$ The second limitation is the potential mismatch in the annotation needs of two languages; not all distinctions that may be desirable for one language (such as grammatical gender in French) are compatible or even present in a parallel language such as English.
