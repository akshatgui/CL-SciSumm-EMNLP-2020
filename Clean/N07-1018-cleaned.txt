Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), a special case of DBNs, are a classical method for important NLP applications such as unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Gael et al., 2009) and grammar induction (Johnson et al, 2007) as well as for ASR. $$$$$ Nonetheless, it is possible to define al gorithms that sample from this distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

Johnson et al (2007a) describe Gibbs samplers for Bayesian inference of PCFG rule probabilities, and these techniques can be used directly with adaptor grammars as well. $$$$$ Bayesian inference using MCMC is a technique of generic utility, much like Expectation-Maximizationand other general inference techniques, and we be lieve that it belongs in every computational linguist?s toolbox alongside these other techniques.Inferring a PCFG to describe the syntactic structure of a natural language is an obvi ous application of grammar inference techniques,and it is well-known that PCFG inference us ing maximum-likelihood techniques such as theInside-Outside (IO) algorithm, a dynamic program ming Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for PCFGs, performs extremely poorly on such tasks.We have applied the Bayesian MCMC methods de scribed here to such problems and obtain resultsvery similar to those produced using IO.

 $$$$$ Applying Bayes?
 $$$$$ We attribute this to the ability of the Bayesian prior to prefer sparse grammars.We expect that these algorithms will be of inter est to the computational linguistics community both because a Bayesian approach to PCFG estimation ismore flexible than the Maximum Likelihood meth ods that currently dominate the field (c.f., the use of a prior as a bias towards sparse solutions), and because these techniques provide essential building blocks for more complex models.
