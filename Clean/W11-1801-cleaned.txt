In the current BioNLP 11 Shared Task1 (Kim et al, 2011), we demonstrate its generalizability to different event extraction tasks by applying what is, to a large extent, the same system to every single task and subtask. $$$$$ The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter) series represents a community-wide move toward fine-grained information extraction (IE), in particular biomolecular event extraction (Kim et al., 2009; Ananiadou et al., 2010).

The BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (BioNLP ST 11) (Kim et al, 2011a), the follow-up event to the BioNLP 09 Shared Task (Kim et al, 2009), was organized from August 2010 (sample data release) to March 2011. $$$$$ Overview of BioNLP Shared Task 2011
The BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (BioNLP ST 11) (Kim et al, 2011a), the follow-up event to the BioNLP 09 Shared Task (Kim et al, 2009), was organized from August 2010 (sample data release) to March 2011. $$$$$ The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter) series represents a community-wide move toward fine-grained information extraction (IE), in particular biomolecular event extraction (Kim et al., 2009; Ananiadou et al., 2010).

For compatibility with the BioNLP ST 09 and its repeat as the GE task in 2011 (Kim et al, 2011b), the REL task training/development/test set division of the GENIA corpus abstracts matches that of the BioNLP ST? 09 data. $$$$$ As the second event of the series, BioNLP-ST 2011 preserves the general design and goals of the previous event, but adds a new focus on variability to address a limitation of BioNLP-ST 2009

These choices may be motivated in part by the success of systems using the tools in the previous shared task and the availability of the analyses as supporting resources (Stenetorp et al., 2011).
