For the sake of comparison, let us consider the following example which Pereira 1981 uses in order to illustrate Extraposition Grammar. $$$$$ The argument for XGs will start with a comparison with DCGs.

A number of nonconcatenative grammar formalisms has been put forward, such as head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extra position grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981). $$$$$ Extraposition Grammars
A number of nonconcatenative grammar formalisms has been put forward, such as head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extra position grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981). $$$$$ The relationship between MGs and DCGs is analogous to that between type-0 grammars and contextfree grammars.

Other non-concatenative formalisms are head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extra position grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981) and various exotic forms of tree adjoining grammar (Kroch and Joshi, 1986). $$$$$ Extraposition Grammars

Whereas head grammars provide for an account of verb fronting and cross-serial dependencies, Pereira, introducing extraposition grammars in (Pereira, 1981), is focused on displacement of noun phrases in English. $$$$$ Extraposition Grammars
Whereas head grammars provide for an account of verb fronting and cross-serial dependencies, Pereira, introducing extraposition grammars in (Pereira, 1981), is focused on displacement of noun phrases in English. $$$$$ With extraposition grammars, I attempt to provide a formalism in which such rules can be written.

XP -* NP While XG allows for elegant accounts of cross-serial dependencies and topicalization, it seems again hard to simultaneously account for verb and noun movement, especially if the bracketing constraint introduced in (Pereira, 1981), which requires that XG derivation graphs have a planar representation, is not relaxed. $$$$$ Now, an XG rule etc .

 $$$$$ To prevent this, I will add arguments to all non-terminals from Which a noun phrase might be extraposed.
 $$$$$ The computing facilities I used to experiment with XGs and to prepare this paper were made available by British Science Research Council grants.
