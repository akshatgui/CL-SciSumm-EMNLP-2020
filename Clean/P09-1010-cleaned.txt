Our approach is most closely related to the reinforcement learning algorithm for mapping text instructions to commands developed by Branavan et al (2009) (see Section 4 for more detail). $$$$$ In this paper, we presented a reinforcement learning approach for inducing a mapping between instructions and actions.

Previous work (Branavan et al, 2009) is only able to handle low-level instructions. $$$$$ We aim to map this text to the corresponding low-level commands and parameters.

Performing policy-gradient with this function is equivalent to training a fully supervised, stochastic gradient algorithm that optimizes conditional likelihood (Branavan et al, 2009). $$$$$ Thus, with this reward policy gradient is equivalent to stochastic gradient ascent with a maximum likelihood objective.
