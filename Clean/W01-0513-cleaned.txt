Indeed, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) provide evidence that suggests that WordNet is as effective an evaluation resource as the web for MWE detection methods, despite its inherent size limitations and static nature. $$$$$ WordNet has definite advantages as an evaluation resource.

Schone and Jurafsky (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001) applied Latent-Semantic Analysis (LSA) to the analysis of MWEs in the task of MWE discovery, by way of rescoring MWEs extracted from the corpus. $$$$$ As an attempt to improve MWU headword induction, we introduce several algorithms using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).

Regarding (i), Schone and Jurafsky (2001) compare the semantic vector of a phrase p and the vectors of its component words in two ways: one includes the contexts of p in the construction of the semantic vectors of the parts and one does not. $$$$$ Table 4 shows the algorithms’ compute semantic vectors for every proposed word performance (including proper nouns). n-gram C=X X ...X Since LSA involves word Though Internet dictionaries and WordNet are counts, we can also compute semantic vectors completely separate “gold standards,” results are surprisingly consistent.

Statistical association measures are frequently used for MWU detection and collocation extraction (e.g. Schone and Jurafsky (2001), Evert and Krenn (2001), Pecina (2010)). $$$$$ Many collocation-finders exist, so one might suspect that most could suffice for finding MWU dictionary headwords.

As our baseline, we use two methods of comparing semantic vectors: sj1 and sj2, both introduced by Schone and Jurafsky (2001). $$$$$ Although this strategy for evaluation is vectors for any word in a corpus (Schone and not flawless, it is reasonable and makes dynamic Jurafsky, 2000).

Examples include automatic thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994), word sense discrimination (Schutze, 1998) and disambiguation (McCarthy et al, 2004), collocation extraction (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001), text segmentation (Choi et al, 2001), and notably information retrieval (Salton et al, 1975). $$$$$ The principal work on segmentation has focused either on identifying words in phonetic streams (Saffran, et. al, 1996; Brent, 1996; de Marcken, 1996) or on tokenizing Asian and Indian languages that do not normally include word delimiters in their orthography (Sproat, et al, 1996; Ponte and Croft 1996; Shimohata, 1997; Teahan, et al., 2000; and many others).

By contrast, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) evaluate the identification of phrasal terms without grammatical filtering on a 6.7 million word extract from the TREC databases, applying both WordNet and on line dictionaries as gold standards. $$$$$ We evaluate using two completely separate gold standards: (1) WordNet and (2) a compendium of Internet dictionaries.

Since Schone and Jurafsky (2001) demonstrated similar results whether WordNet or on line dictionaries were used as a gold standard, WordNet was selected. $$$$$ One can conclude that WordNet may safely be used as a gold standard in future MWU headword evaluations.

There have also been a number of papers focusing on the detection of semantic non-compositional items in recent years beginning with the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2001). $$$$$ In other words, MWUs are typically non-compositional at some linguistic level.

Furthermore, lists of topical unigrams are often made only marginally interpretable by virtue of their non-compositionality, the principle that a collocation's meaning typically is not derivable from its constituent words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001). $$$$$ In other words, MWUs are typically non-compositional at some linguistic level.
