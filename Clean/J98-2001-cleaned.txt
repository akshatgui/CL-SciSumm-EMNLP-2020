Associative anaphora (e.g., Poesio and Vieira, 1998) and indirect anaphora (e.g., Murata and Nagao, 2000) are virtually the same phenomena that this paper is concerned with. $$$$$ Considering the difference between the relative importance of the same-head anaphora class in the first experiment and of the coreferent class in the second experiment we can estimate that approximately 15% of definite descriptions are coreferential and have a different head from their antecedents.

A serious problem when working with bridging reference sis the fact that subjects, when asked for judgments about bridging references in general, have a great deal of difficulty in agreeing on which expressions in the corpus are bridging references, and what their anchors are (Poesio and Vieira, 1998). $$$$$ There were only 7 definite descriptions classified by all three annotators as bridging references; in 5 of these cases (71%) the three annotators also agreed on a textual antecedent (i.e., on the discourse entity to which the bridging reference was related to).

Poesio and Vieira (1998) carried out corpus studies indicating that in corpora like the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank. $$$$$ First of all, we classified the definite descriptions included in 20 randomly chosen articles from the Wall Street Journal contained in the subset of the Penn Treebank corpus included in the ACL/DCI CD-ROM.12 All together, these articles contain 1,040 instances of definite description use.

Poesio and Vieira (1998) found that of the 1,400 definite descriptions in their corpus, only about 50% were subsequent mention or bridging references, whereas 50% were first mentions. $$$$$ On the positive side, we have two observations

In fact, it has been shown that the agreement of subjects annotating bridging (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) or discourse (Cimiano,2003) relations can be too low for tentative conclusion to be drawn (Carletta, 1996). $$$$$ And indeed, the agreement figures went up from K = 0.63 to K = 0.68 (ignoring doubts) when we did so, i.e., within the &quot;tentative&quot; margins of agreement according to Carletta (1996) (0.68 < x < 0.8).

Poesio and Vieira (1998) report lower human agreement on more fine-grained classifications of definite descriptions. $$$$$ Theories of definite descriptions such as (Christophersen 1939; Hawkins 1978; Webber 1979; Prince 1981; Heim 1982) identify two subtasks involved in the interpretation of a definite description

as Poesio and Vieira (1998) show, only about 2/3 of definite descriptions which are anaphoric have the same head as their antecedent. $$$$$ We assigned to this class those definite descriptions that stand in an anaphoric or associative anaphoric relation with an antecedent explicitly mentioned in the text, but that are not identified by the same head noun as their antecedent.
as Poesio and Vieira (1998) show, only about 2/3 of definite descriptions which are anaphoric have the same head as their antecedent. $$$$$ We also replaced the anaphoric (same head) class we had in the first experiment with a broader coreferent class including all cases in which a definite description is coreferential with its antecedent, whether or not the head noun was the same

In previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) we reported the results of corpus annotation experiments in which the subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in Wall Stree Journal articles. $$$$$ We ran two experiments, in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of 33 newspaper articles, containing a total of 1,412 definite descriptions.
