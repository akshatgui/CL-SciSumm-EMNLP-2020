Other approaches combine lattices or N-best lists from several different MT systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ Each time, the best possible cover for each part is recursively found, and the two scores are combined to give a score for the chart walk containing the two best subwalks.
Other approaches combine lattices or N-best lists from several different MT systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ These different splits are then compared with each other and with components from the chart spanning the whole region (if any), and the overall best result is Without dynamic programming, this would have a D 2 combinatorial time complexity.

that is hopefully better than any of its ingredients, an idea pionieered in (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ A less ambitious version of this idea would be to run the low-scoring engines only where there are gaps in the normally high-scoring engines.

Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) produced the first MEMT system by combining outputs from three different MT engines based on their knowledge of the inner workings of the engines. $$$$$ This assumes that we can reliably estimate scores in advance (not currently true for the expensive engines), and that the engines can be run on fragments.

Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997), named entity recognition (Borthwick et al, 1998), partial parsing (Inui and Inui, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002) and question answering (Chu-Carroll et al, 2003). $$$$$ The main option for human interaction in TWS currently is the Component Machine-Aided Translation (CMAT) editor (Frederking et al., 1993a).

Now back in machine translation, we do find some work addressing such concern $$$$$ Figure 1 presents a general view of the operation of our multi-engine MT system.
Now back in machine translation, we do find some work addressing such concern $$$$$ The best method we could find was counting the number of keystrokes in the TWS to convert the outputs of individual engines and the multi-engine configuration to a &quot;canonical&quot; human translation.

Brown and Frederking (1995) is a continuation of Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) with an addition of a n-gram based mechanism for a candidate selection. $$$$$ The EBMT scores are produced using a technique based on human judgements, as described in (Nirenburg et al., 1994a), submitted.
Brown and Frederking (1995) is a continuation of Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) with an addition of a n-gram based mechanism for a candidate selection. $$$$$ We plan to use a standard regression mechanism to modify the scoring system based on feedback from having humans select the best covers for test texts.

The first example of this approach was the multi-engine MT system (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), which builds a chart using the translation units inside each input system and then uses a chart walk algorithm to find the best cover of the source sentence. Rosti et al (2007a) collect source-to-target correspondences from the input systems, create a new translation option table using only these phrases, and re-decode the source sentence to generate better translations. $$$$$ The outputs from these engines (target language words and phrases) are recorded in a chart whose positions correspond to words in the source language input.

System combination procedures, on the other hand, generate translations from the output of multiple component systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ Figure 3 presents the chart walk algorithm used to produce a single, best, non-overlapping, contiguous combination (cover) of the available component translations, assuming correct component quality scores.

In Machine Translation (MT), there is a long tradition of combining multiple machine translations, as through a Multi-Engine MT (MEMT) architecture; the origins of this are generally credited to Frederking and Nirenburg (1994). $$$$$ Figure 1 presents a general view of the operation of our multi-engine MT system.

System combination procedures, on the other hand, generate translations from the output of multiple component systems by combining the best fragments of these outputs (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994). $$$$$ The chart manager selects the overall best cover from the collection of candidate partial translations by normalizing each component's quality score (positive, with larger being better), and then selecting the best combination of components with the help of the chart walk algorithm.
