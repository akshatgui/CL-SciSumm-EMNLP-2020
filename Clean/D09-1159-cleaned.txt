A previous work that used structured kernels in Sentiment Analysis is the approach of Wu et al (2009). $$$$$ Previous works on mining opinions can be divided into two directions

The results showed by Wu et al (2009) suggest that tree kernels on dependency trees are a good approach but we also plan to employ string kernels on this task. $$$$$ Dependency tree kernels has been proposed by (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).

We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines $$$$$ Dependency tree kernels has been proposed by (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).
We compared our aspect identification approach against two baselines $$$$$ However, in other domains, directly adjacent method is better than the learning based methods.

Afterwards, Wu et al (2009) utilized the dependency parser to extract the noun phrases and verb phrases from the reviews as the aspect candidates. $$$$$ A phrase dependency tree is defined as T = (V , E ), where V is the set of phrases, E is the dependency relations among the phrases in V representing by direct edges.
Afterwards, Wu et al (2009) utilized the dependency parser to extract the noun phrases and verb phrases from the reviews as the aspect candidates. $$$$$ While prepositional phrases (PPs) and adjectival phrases (ADJPs) are excluded.

Phrase dependency grammars have recently been used by Wu et al (2009) for feature extraction for opinion mining. $$$$$ Phrase Dependency Parsing for Opinion Mining
Phrase dependency grammars have recently been used by Wu et al (2009) for feature extraction for opinion mining. $$$$$ Opinion mining has recently received considerable attention.

For a monolingual task, Wu et al (2009) used a shallow parser to convert lexical dependencies from a dependency parser into phrase dependencies. $$$$$ To construct phrase dependency tree, we propose a method which combines results from an existing shallow parser and a lexical dependency parser.

We compared our approach against two state-of-the art methods $$$$$ Dependency tree kernels has been proposed by (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).

For example, Wu et al (2009) identified aspects based on the features explored by dependency parser. $$$$$ The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage, a sentence, a phrase and even a word (Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).

A wide spectrum of tasks have been studied under review mining, ranging from coarse-grained document-level polarity classification (Pang et al,2002) to fine-grained extraction of opinion expressions and their targets (Wu et al, 2009). $$$$$ The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage, a sentence, a phrase and even a word (Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).

For MaxEnt training, we tried three labeled data sets $$$$$ Then for each product feature, they annotated the opinion expression which has relation with it.

To test this hypothesis, we tried two quite different training data sets, one from the cell phone domain and the other from the DVD player domain, both used in (Wu et al, 2009). $$$$$ Our corpus is selected from them, which contains customer reviews of 11 products belong to 5 categories(Diaper, Cell Phone, Digital Camera, DVD Player, and MP3 Player).

In supervised approaches, various kinds of models were applied, such as HMM (Jin and Ho, 2009), SVM (Wu et al, 2009) and CRFs (Li et al, 2010). $$$$$ The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage, a sentence, a phrase and even a word (Somasundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).
