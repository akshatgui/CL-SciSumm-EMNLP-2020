Finally, there has been recent work on applying unsupervised multilingual learning to morphological segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008). $$$$$ This example illustrates the potential benefits of unsupervised multilingual learning.

 $$$$$ For each new phrase-pair, the model first chooses the number and type of morphemes to be generated.

(Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) use multilingual data to compute segmentations of Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English. $$$$$ We test our model on a multilingual corpus of short parallel phrases drawn from the Hebrew Bible and Arabic, Aramaic, and English translations.
(Snyder and Barzilay, 2008) use multilingual data to compute segmentations of Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English. $$$$$ We donâ€™t have gold standard segmentations for the English and Aramaic portions of the data, and thus restrict our evaluation to Hebrew and Arabic.

Snyder and Barzilay (2008) uses a set of aligned phrases across related languages to learn how to segment words with a Bayesian model and is otherwise fully unsupervised. $$$$$ Overview In order to simultaneously model probabilistic dependencies across languages as well as morpheme distributions within each language, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian model.2 Our segmentation model is based on the notion that stable recurring string patterns within words are indicative of morphemes.
Snyder and Barzilay (2008) uses a set of aligned phrases across related languages to learn how to segment words with a Bayesian model and is otherwise fully unsupervised. $$$$$ The number of words in such phrases ranges from one to four words in the Semitic languages and up to six words in English.

The very interesting study by Snyder and Barzilay (2008) on multilingual approaches to morphological segmentation was difficult to classify. $$$$$ Unsupervised Multilingual Learning for Morphological Segmentation
The very interesting study by Snyder and Barzilay (2008) on multilingual approaches to morphological segmentation was difficult to classify. $$$$$ In particular, we study the task of morphological segmentation of multiple languages.

Snyder and Barzilay (2008a; 2008b) consider learning morphological segmentation with non parametric Bayesian model from multilingual data. $$$$$ Unsupervised Multilingual Learning for Morphological Segmentation
Snyder and Barzilay (2008a; 2008b) consider learning morphological segmentation with non parametric Bayesian model from multilingual data. $$$$$ During testing, we do not allow the models to consider any multilingual evidence.

 $$$$$ For each new phrase-pair, the model first chooses the number and type of morphemes to be generated.

For a majority of our testing we borrow the parallel phrases corpus used in previous work (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), which we refer to as S&B. $$$$$ Given a parallel corpus, the annotations are projected from this source language to its counterpart, and the resulting annotations are used for supervised training in the target language.
For a majority of our testing we borrow the parallel phrases corpus used in previous work (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), which we refer to as S&B. $$$$$ The approach presented here differs from previous work in two significant ways.

Our work also has connections to multilingual tokenization (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008). $$$$$ Unsupervised Multilingual Learning for Morphological Segmentation
Our work also has connections to multilingual tokenization (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008). $$$$$ Abstract Morpheme Distribution To model the connections between morphemes across languages, we further define a model for bilingual morpheme pairs, or abstract morphemes.

Snyder and Barzilay (2008) use bilingual information but the segmentation is learned independently from translation modeling. $$$$$ In addition the model can incorporate character-to-character phonetic correspondences between alphabets as prior information, thus allowing the implicit modeling of cognates.
