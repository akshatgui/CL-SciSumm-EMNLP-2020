It has been shown in (Mikheev et al, 1999) that a NE Recognition system performs reasonably well for most classes even without gazetteers. $$$$$ Nevertheless, in a recent article Cucchiarelli et al.

Mikheev et al (1999) exploit label consistency information within a document using relatively ad hoc multi-stage labeling procedures. $$$$$ One such application is document retrieval or automated document forwarding

To date, Named Entity Recognition (NER) has only used gazetteers as evidence that a text span could be some kind of place name (LOCATION), even though their finite nature makes lists of names of limited use for classification (Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ Named Entity Recognition Without Gazetteers

Other work has supported the use of gazetteers in general but has found that lists of only moderate size are sufficient to provide most of the benefit (Mikheev et al, 1999). $$$$$ We show that, for the text type and task of this competition, it is sufficient to use relatively small gazetteers of well-known names, rather than large gazetteers of low-frequency names.

To investigate the role of gazetteers in NER, Mikheev et al (1999) combine grammar rules with maximum entropy models and vary the gazetteer size. $$$$$ Once this has been done, the system again applies the grammar rules.

Since many tagging systems utilise gazetteers of known entities, some research has focused on their automatic extraction from the web (Etzioni et al, 2005) or Wikipedia (Toral et al, 2008), although Mikheev et al (1999) and others have shown that larger NE lists do not necessarily correspond to increased NER performance. $$$$$ Nevertheless, in a recent article Cucchiarelli et al.
