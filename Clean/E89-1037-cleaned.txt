In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al (1989). $$$$$ In the following sections we outline these basic notions and show how they can be used to deal with certain interesting translation problems in a simple and straightforward way.
In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al (1989). $$$$$ In other cases there is a non-local dependency between the subcategorizing verb and a dislocated phrase.

We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ In this paper we sketch an approach to machine translation that offers several advantages compared to many of the other strategies currently being pursued.
We have shown in this paper that the approach to transfer between feature structures introduced in Kaplan et al 1989 can be exploited to deal with the translation of anaphoric dependeneins. $$$$$ The latter is introduced by the transfer entry for Again this f-structure satisfies the transfer description and is also assigned by the French grammar to the target sentence.

The first one applies semantic transfer model via the methodology similar to the lexical functional grammar (Kaplan et al., 1989) and it is develop with the intention of public use. $$$$$ Our approach uses the equality- and description-based mechanisms of Lexical-Functional Grammar.
The first one applies semantic transfer model via the methodology similar to the lexical functional grammar (Kaplan et al., 1989) and it is develop with the intention of public use. $$$$$ As introduced by Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), lexical-functional grammar assigns to every sentence two levels of syntactic representation, a constituent structure (c-structure) and a functional structure (f-structure).

 $$$$$ Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), for example, discuss a level of semantic structure that encodes predicate-argument relations and quantifier scope, information that does not enter into the kinds of syntactic generalizations that the f-structure supports.

Kaplan et al (1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. $$$$$ This approach permits the mapping between source and target to depend on information from various levels of linguistic abstraction while still preserving the modularity of linguistic components and of source and target grammars and lexicons.
Kaplan et al (1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified. $$$$$ We also achieve modularity of a more basic sort: our correspondence mechanism permits contrastive transfer rules that depend on but do not duplicate the specifications of independently motivated grammars of the source and target languages (Isabelle and Macklovitch, 1986; Netter and Wedekind, 1986).

Kaplan et al (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. $$$$$ We sketch and illustrate an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between separate levels of linguistic representation, as in the of codescriptions.
Kaplan et al (1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation. $$$$$ We will illustrate our proposal with examples that have posed challenges for some other approaches.

Kaplan et al (1989) discussed such differences in embedding and offered two alternative analyses that rely only on codescriptive specifications. $$$$$ Differences in embedding.
