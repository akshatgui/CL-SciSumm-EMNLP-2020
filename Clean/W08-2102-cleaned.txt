This strategy is similar to the one employed by Carreras et al (2008) to prune the search space of the actual parser. $$$$$ We describe a method that leverages a simple, first-order dependency parser to restrict the search space of the TAG parser in training and testing.

This approach can be seen as trade-off between phrase based reranking experiments (Collins, 2000) and the approach of Carreras et al (2008) where a discriminative model is used to score lexical features representing unlabelled dependencies in the Tree Adjoining Grammar formalism. $$$$$ We show that efficient training is feasible, using a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) based parsing formalism.

Our system also compares favourably with the system of Carreras et al (2008) that relies on a more complex generative model, namely Tree Adjoining Grammars, and the system of Suzuki et al (2009) that makes use of external data (unannotated text). $$$$$ Recent work (Petrov et al., 2007; Finkel et al., 2008) describes log-linear GLMs applied to PCFG representations, but does not make use of dependency features.

Carreras et al (2008) use coarse-to-fine pruning with dependency parsing, but in that case, a graph based dependency parser provides the coarse pass, with the fine pass being a far-more-expensive tree adjoining grammar. $$$$$ We show that efficient training is feasible, using a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) based parsing formalism.
Carreras et al (2008) use coarse-to-fine pruning with dependency parsing, but in that case, a graph based dependency parser provides the coarse pass, with the fine pass being a far-more-expensive tree adjoining grammar. $$$$$ A crucial advantage of our approach is that it considers a very large set of alternatives in Y(x), and can thereby avoid search errors that may be made in the first-pass parser.1 Another approach that allows efficient training of GLMs is to use simpler syntactic representations, in particular dependency structures (McDonald et al., 2005).

Suzuki et al (2009) and phrase-structure annotations in the case of Carreras et al (2008). $$$$$ In global linear models (GLMs) for structured prediction, (e.g., (Johnson et al., 1999; Lafferty et al., 2001; Collins, 2002; Altun et al., 2003; Taskar et al., 2004)), the optimal label y* for an input x is where Y(x) is the set of possible labels for the input x; f(x, y) E Rd is a feature vector that represents the pair (x, y); and w is a parameter vector.

Many edges can be ruled out beforehand, either based on the distance in the sentence between the two words (Eisner and Smith, 2010), the predictions of a local ranker (Martins et al2009), or the marginals computed from a simpler parsing model (Carreras et al2008). $$$$$ For the first-order model, the methods described in (Eisner, 2000) can be used for the parsing algorithm.

The key idea in our approach is to allow highly flexible reordering operations, in combination with a discriminative model that can condition on rich features of the source-language input string. Our approach builds on a variant of tree adjoining grammar (TAG; (Joshi and Schabes, 1997)) (specifically, the formalism of (Carreras et al, 2008)). $$$$$ The parsing formalism we use is related to the tree adjoining grammar (TAG) formalisms described in (Chiang, 2003; Shen and Joshi, 2005).

To continue our example, the resulting entry would be as follows $$$$$ The combination of the left and right modifier structures has led to flat structures, for example the rule VP → ADVP VP NP in the above tree.
To continue our example, the resulting entry would be as follows $$$$$ For example, on section 22 of the treebank, if derivations are first extracted using the method described in this section, then mapped back to parse trees using the method described in section 2.3, the resulting parse trees score 100% precision and 99.81% recall in labeled constituent accuracy, indicating that very little information is lost in this process.
