Approaches to the induction of morphology as presented in e.g. Schone and Jurafsky (2001) or Goldsmith (2001) show that the morphological properties of a small subset of languages can be induced with high accuracy, most of the existing approaches are motivated by applied or engineering concerns, and thus make assumptions that are less cognitively plausible. $$$$$ Previous morphology induction approaches have fallen into three categories.

Schone and Jurafsky (2001) select words with frequency higher than 5 to induce morphological segmentation. $$$$$ Hence, the last category of research is also knowledge-free but attempts to induce, for each morphological variants of each other.

Presupposing input driven learning, it has been shown in the literature that initial segmenations into words (or word-like units) is possible with unsupervised methods (e.g. Brent and Cartwright (1996)), that induction of morphology is possible (e.g. Goldsmith (2001), Schone and Jurafsky (2001)) and even the induction of syntactic structures (e.g. Van Zaanen (2001)). $$$$$ In English, for example, this yielded 30535 possible rules.

These models include the signature of (Goldsmith 2001), the conflation set of (Schone and Jurafsky 2001), the paradigm of (Brent et. al. 2002), and the inflectional class of (Monson 2004). $$$$$ Brent, et al. (1995) used minimum description length (MDL) to find the most data-compressing suffixes.

In later work, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) extend their technique to identify not only suffixes but also prefixes and circumfixes by building both forward and backward tries over a corpus. $$$$$ Our algorithm is also applied to German and Dutch and evaluated on its ability to find prefixes, suffixes, and circumfixes in these languages.
In later work, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) extend their technique to identify not only suffixes but also prefixes and circumfixes by building both forward and backward tries over a corpus. $$$$$ In our earlier work, we (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) generated a list of N candidate suffixes and used this list to identify word pairs which share the same stem but conclude with distinct candidate suffixes.

 $$$$$ Our algorithm has changed somewhat, though, since we previously sought word pairs that vary only by a prefix or a suffix, yet we now wish to generalize to those with circumfixing differences.

(Goldsmith 2000) presents an unsupervised technique based on the expectation maximization algorithm and minimum description length to segment exactly one suffix per word, resulting in an F-score of 81.8 for suffix identification in English according to (Schone and Jurafsky 2001). $$$$$ Brent, et al.

Often trie similarities are used as a first step followed by further processing to identify morphemes (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001). $$$$$ In our earlier work, we (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) generated a list of N candidate suffixes and used this list to identify word pairs which share the same stem but conclude with distinct candidate suffixes.
Often trie similarities are used as a first step followed by further processing to identify morphemes (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001). $$$$$ If we strip off “re-” from all words, and add all residuals to a trie, the branch of the trie of words beginning with “a” is depicted in Figure 2.

Like Schone and Jurafsky (2001), we build clusters that will have both inflectionally and derivationally related stems and evaluate them with respect to a gold standard of only inflectionally related stems. $$$$$ Yet we build upon this algorithm in several ways in that we

Schone and Jurafsky (2001) builds on this approach, but adds more ad hoc parameters to handle circumfixation. $$$$$ Since our Most of the existing algorithms described focus on approach falls into this category (expanding upon suffixing in inflectional languages (though our earlier approach (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000)), Jacquemin and DéJean describe work on prefixes). we describe work in this area in more detail.

Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employ distributions over adjacent words (yielding a syntactic distance metric) to improve the precision of their conflation sets. $$$$$ Our algorithm combines cues from orthography, semantics, and syntactic distributions to induce morphological relationships in German, Dutch, and English.
Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employ distributions over adjacent words (yielding a syntactic distance metric) to improve the precision of their conflation sets. $$$$$ This suggests that performance could improve if the induction process took advantage of local, syntactic contexts around words in addition to the more global, large-window contexts used in semantic processing. a randomly-chosen set of words from the corpus as well as for each of the PPMVs of the ruleset that are not yet validated.

In addition, we measure precision, recall, and F1 as in Schone and Jurafsky (2001). $$$$$ Table 5 uses the above scoring mechanism to compare the F-Scores (product of precision and recall divided by average of the two ) of our system at a cutoff threshold of 85% to those of our earlier algorithm (“S/J2000”) at the same threshold; Goldsmith; and a baseline system which performs no analysis (claiming that for any word, its conflation set only consists of itself).

Nevertheless, these metrics give us a point of comparison with Schone and Jurafsky (2001) who, using a vocabulary of English words occurring at least 10 times in a 6.7 million word newswire corpus, report F1 of 88.1 for conflation sets based only on suffixation, and 84.5 for circumfixation. $$$$$ We applied our system to an English corpus and evaluated by comparing each word’s conflation set as produced by our algorithm to those derivable from CELEX. word of a corpus, a complete analysis.
