For purposes of pruning, and only for purposes of pruning, the prior probability of each constituent category is multiplied by the generative probability of that constituent (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ The probability of node L, = Nx is just its prior probability times its inside 3,k probability, as before.
For purposes of pruning, and only for purposes of pruning, the prior probability of each constituent category is multiplied by the generative probability of that constituent (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ The grammars described here are fairly simple, presented for purposes of explication.

For example, Goodman (1997) suggests using a coarse grammar consisting of regular non-terminals, such as NP and VP, and then non-terminals augmented with head-word information for the more accurate second-pass grammar. $$$$$ For instance, the first pass could use regular nonterminals, such as NP and VP and the second pass could use nonterminals augmented with head-word information.

As in most other statistical parsing systems we therefore use the pruning technique described in Goodman (1997) and Collins (1999 $$$$$ Thus, we instead multiply the inside probability simply by the prior probability of the nonterminal type, P(X), which is an approximation to the outside probability.

We first applied beam thresholding techniques developed for CFG parsing to HPSG parsing, including local thresholding, global thresholding (Goodman, 1997), and iterative parsing (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005b). $$$$$ Global Thresholding And Multiple-Pass Parsing
We first applied beam thresholding techniques developed for CFG parsing to HPSG parsing, including local thresholding, global thresholding (Goodman, 1997), and iterative parsing (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005b). $$$$$ There is no reason that we cannot use beam thresholding, global thresholding, and multiple-pass parsing all at the same time.

Beam thresholding (Goodman, 1997) is a simple and effective technique for pruning edges during parsing. $$$$$ This technique is called beam thresholding.

For the experiments reported in this paper, we use as parser P, our in-house implementation of the Collins parser (Collins, 2003), to which various 893 speed-related enhancements (Goodman, 1997) have been applied. $$$$$ Collins (personal communication) independently observed the usefulness of this modification, and Caraballo and Charniak (1996) used a related technique in a best-first parser.

We used beam thresholding, global thresholding (Goodman, 1997), preserved iterative parsing (Ninomiya et al, 2005) and quick check (Malouf et al, 2000). $$$$$ Rayner et al. used this insight for a hierarchical, non-recursive grammar, and only used their technique to prune after the first level of the grammar.

We used beam thresholding, global thresholding (Goodman, 1997), preserved iterative parsing (Ninomiya et al, 2005) and other techniques for deep parsing. $$$$$ We introduce two novel thresholding techniques, global thresholding and multiple-pass parsing, and one significant variation on traditional beam thresholding.

However, if many iterations are required to obtain a parse, the utility of starting with a low beam and iterating becomes questionable (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ This introduces problems, since in many PCFGs, almost any combination of nonterminals is possible, perhaps with some low probability.
However, if many iterations are required to obtain a parse, the utility of starting with a low beam and iterating becomes questionable (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ While we had not spent a great deal of time hand optimizing these parameters, we are very encouraged by the optimization algorithm's practical utility.

A paper closely related to ours is Goodman (1997). $$$$$ In this paper, we examine thresholding techniques for statistical parsers.

A prime example of this idea is from Goodman (1997), who describes a method for producing a simple but crude approximate grammar of a standard context-free grammar. $$$$$ Thus, our grammar was a kind of 6-gram model on symbols in the grammar.4 Figure 8 shows an example of how we converted trees to binary branching with our grammar.

However, M1 is usually not preferred in practice (Goodman, 1997). $$$$$ Ideally, as we loosened the -threshold, every sentence should improve on every metric, but in practice, that wasn't the case.

However, if combined with other inexact pruning techniques like beam-pruning (Goodman, 1997) or coarse-to-fine parsing (Charniak et al, 2006), binarization may interact with those pruning methods in a complicated way to affect parsing accuracy. $$$$$ While there exist theoretically efficient (0(n3)) algorithms for parsing Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) and related formalisms, practical parsing algorithms usually make use of pruning techniques, such as beam thresholding, for increased speed.
