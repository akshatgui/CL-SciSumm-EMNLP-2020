The adapted spelling-based generative model is similar to (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ The transliteration process is based on a generative model of how an English name is transliterated into Arabic.

Transliteration from English to Arabic and Chinese is complicated (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ We apply our transliteration algorithm to the transliteration of names from Arabic into English.
Transliteration from English to Arabic and Chinese is complicated (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ Therefore, each name in the list is classified in one of three categories ARABIC, for names of Arabic origin; ENGLISH, for names of English origin; and OTHER, for names of other origins including Chinese, Russian, Indian, etc.

of these entities is in most cases actually a (more or less phonetic) transliteration, see for example (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ The approach described by Kawtrakul et al. (1998) requires a phonetic dictionary of English in order to match phonetic sequences.
of these entities is in most cases actually a (more or less phonetic) transliteration, see for example (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ In some cases where more than one possible transliteration is acceptable, this criterion is too rigid.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) transliterated named entities in Arabic text to English by combining phonetic-based and spelling-based models, and re-ranking candidates with full-name web counts, named entities co-reference, and contextual web counts. $$$$$ Unlikely candidates can be eliminated by filtering out candidates with zero Web counts.
Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) transliterated named entities in Arabic text to English by combining phonetic-based and spelling-based models, and re-ranking candidates with full-name web counts, named entities co-reference, and contextual web counts. $$$$$ The Web-based filtering is useful only for our spelling-based model since all candidates generated by the phonetic-based model are in the pronunciation dictionary and all have non-zero Web counts.

These results are also comparable to other state-of-the-art statistical Arabic name trans literation systems such as (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ We introduce a new spelling-based model that is much more accurate than state-of-the-art phonetic-based models and can be trained on easier-toobtain training data.

The phonetics-based and spelling-based models have been linearly combined into a single transliteration model in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b) for transliteration of Arabic named entities into English. $$$$$ The transliteration process is based on a generative model of how an English name is transliterated into Arabic.

To improve this performance, we plan to enrich the Arabic lexicon with more proper names, using either name recognition (Maloney and Niv, 1998) or a back translation approach after name recognition in English texts (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ Machine Transliteration Of Names In Arabic Texts
To improve this performance, we plan to enrich the Arabic lexicon with more proper names, using either name recognition (Maloney and Niv, 1998) or a back translation approach after name recognition in English texts (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ The approach described by Kawtrakul et al. (1998) requires a phonetic dictionary of English in order to match phonetic sequences.

Subsequently, the performance of this system was greatly improved by combining different spelling and phonetic models (Al-Onaizan and Knight,2002). $$$$$ The phonetic-based and spelling-based models can be linearly combined into a single transliteration model.
Subsequently, the performance of this system was greatly improved by combining different spelling and phonetic models (Al-Onaizan and Knight,2002). $$$$$ We believe that the reason is that equal weights were given to the phonetic-based and spelling-based models in the combination.

For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation. $$$$$ Stalls and Knight (1998) present an Arabic-toEnglish back-transliteration system based on the source-channel framework.
For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation. $$$$$ The model proposed by Stalls and Knight (1998) uses a pronunciation dictionary to do this conversion.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters. $$$$$ Transliteration is the process of replacing words in the source language with their approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents in the target language.
Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters. $$$$$ Hence, the language model was mostly trained on English names.

Similarly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable. $$$$$ Transliterating names between languages that use similar alphabets and sound systems is often very simple, since the phrase mostly remains the same.
Similarly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable. $$$$$ The use of this spelling correction model slightly improves our transliterations, as shown in Table 3.

 $$$$$ For example, Graham is typically transliterated by humans into Arabic as &quot;r .Orciham&quot; and not as jrcim&quot; .
 $$$$$ This is because the blind set is mostly of highly frequent, prominent politicians; whereas the development set contains also names of writers and less common political figures and hence are less likely to be in our unigram language model (and our pronunciation dictionary in the case of the phonetic-based model).
