(Chen and Liu,1992) and many subsequent works), or uses the position of characters in a word as the basis for segmentation (Xue, 2003). In terms of processing model, this is a contradiction since segmentation should be the pre-requisite of dictionary lookup and should not presuppose lexical information. $$$$$ Therefore the first step of processing Chinese sentences i to identify the words.
