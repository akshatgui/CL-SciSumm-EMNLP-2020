In our first experiment we used the English-German portion of the CLTE corpus described in (Negri et al., 2011), consisting of 500 multi-directional entailment pairs which we equally divided into training and test sets. $$$$$ Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) has been recently proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010; Mehdad et al., 2011) as an extension of Textual Entailment (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).

The corpora used in the experiments comes from a cross-lingual Textual Entailment dataset presented in (Negri et al, 2011), and provided by the task organizers. $$$$$ We address the creation of cross-lingual textual entailment corpora by means of crowdsourcing.

Defining "entailment" is quite difficult when dealing with expert annotators and still more with non-experts, as was noted by Negri et al. (2011). $$$$$ We show that a complex data creation task, for which even experts usually feature low agreement scores, can be effectively decomposed into simple subtasks assigned to non-expert annotators.

The dataset provided by the organizers consists of 500 CLTE pairs translated to four languages following the crowdsourcing-based methodology proposed in (Negri et al., 2011). $$$$$ Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) has been recently proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010; Mehdad et al., 2011) as an extension of Textual Entailment (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).
The dataset provided by the organizers consists of 500 CLTE pairs translated to four languages following the crowdsourcing-based methodology proposed in (Negri et al., 2011). $$$$$ To achieve our objectives, we developed a “divide and conquer” methodology based on crowdsourcing.

Two datasets were provided by the organization of SemEval 2012 (Negri et al, 2011) $$$$$ The first one, at the beginning of the process, aims to obtain a set of parallel sentences to start with, and can be done in different ways (e.g. crowdsourcing the translation of a set of sentences).

There was one training set for each French-English, German-English, Italian-English, Spanish-English language combination (Negri et al, 2011). $$$$$ The resulting dataset, obtained from a pipeline of different jobs routed to Amazon Mechanical Turk, contains more than 1,600 aligned pairs for each combination of texts-hypotheses in English, Italian and German.
There was one training set for each French-English, German-English, Italian-English, Spanish-English language combination (Negri et al, 2011). $$$$$ Related research in the CLTE direction is reported in (Negri and Mehdad, 2010), which describes the creation of an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE-3 dataset by translating the English hypotheses into Spanish.

The values of the parameters were chosen based on the CLTE development dataset (Negri et al, 2011) and were as follows. $$$$$ Cross-lingual Textual Entailment (CLTE) has been recently proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010; Mehdad et al., 2011) as an extension of Textual Entailment (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).
