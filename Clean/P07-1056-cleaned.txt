Blitzer et al (2007) used structural correspondence learning to train a classifier on source data with new features induced from target unlabeled data. $$$$$ As we noted in Section 5, we are able to significantly outperform basic structural correspondence learning (Blitzer et al., 2006).

(2006) did combine SCL with labeled target domain data, they only compared using the label of SCL or non-SCL source classifiers as features, following the work of Florian et al.

Empirical work on NLP domain shifts has focused on the former. For example, Blitzer et al (2007) learned correspondences between features across domains and Jiang and Zhai (2007) weighted source domain examples by their similarity to the target distribution. We continue in this tradition by making two assumptions about our setting. $$$$$ Sections 2-5 focused on how to adapt to a target domain when you had a labeled source dataset.

We selected three data sets commonly used in domain adaptation $$$$$ Ando and Zhang (2005) and Blitzer et al. (2006) suggest λ = 10−4, µ = 0, which we have used in our results so far.

In a batch setting this corresponds to learning a linear classifier to discriminate the domains, and Blitzer et al (2007) showed correlations with the error from domain adaptation. $$$$$ When it is 0, the two domains are indistinguishable using a linear classifier.

However, such methods require the existence of either a parallel corpus/machine translation engine for projecting/translating annotations/lexica from a resource-rich language to the target language (Banea et al., 2008; Wan, 2008), or a domain that is "similar" enough to the target domain (Blitzer et al, 2007). $$$$$ We augment each labeled target instance xj with the label assigned by the source domain classifier (Florian et al., 2004; Blitzer et al., 2006).

We use five sentiment classification datasets, including the widely-used movie review dataset [MOV] (Pang et al, 2002) as well as four datasets containing reviews of four different types of products from Amazon [books (BOO), DVDs (DVD), electronics (ELE), and kitchen appliances (KIT)] (Blitzer et al, 2007). $$$$$ We propose solutions to these two questions and evaluate them on a corpus of reviews for four different types of products from Amazon

We show that this constraint is effective on the sentiment classification task (Pang et al, 2002), resulting in scores similar to the ones obtained by the structural correspondence methods (Blitzer et al, 2007) without the need to engineer auxiliary tasks. $$$$$ Sentiment classification has advanced considerably since the work of Pang et al. (2002), which we use as our baseline.

We evaluate our approach on adapting sentiment classifiers on 4 domains $$$$$ Adapting classifiers from books to DVDs, for instance, is easier than adapting them from books to kitchen appliances.

Both the achieved error reduction and the absolute score match the results reported in (Blitzer et al, 2007) for the best version of the SCL method (SCL-MI, 36%), suggesting that our approach is a viable alternative to SCL. $$$$$ When we report results with SCL and SCL-MI, we require that pivots occur in more than five documents in each domain.

To evaluate our approach, we consider the same dataset as the one used to evaluate the SCL method (Blitzer et al, 2007). $$$$$ Second, we evaluate the A-distance (Ben-David et al., 2006) between domains as measure of the loss due to adaptation from one to the other.

Second, the absolute scores achieved in Blitzer et al (2007) are slightly worse than those demonstrated in our experiments both for supervised and semi-supervised methods. $$$$$ A supervised classifier trained on book reviews cannot assign weight to the kitchen features in the second row of table 2.

Our approach results in competitive domain adaptation performance on the sentiment classification task, rivalling that of the state-of-the-art SCLmethod (Blitzer et al, 2007). $$$$$ First, we show how to extend the recently proposed structural correspondence learning (SCL) domain adaptation algorithm (Blitzer et al., 2006) for use in sentiment classification.
