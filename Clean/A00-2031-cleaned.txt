More recently, a domain independent system has been trained on general function tags such as Manner and Temporal by Blaheta and Charniak (2000). $$$$$ This data is very important in distinguishing, for example, 'by John' (where John might be a logical subject) from 'by next year' (a temporal modifier) and 'by selling it' (an adverbial indicating manner).

These features are generated using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and a function tagger (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000). $$$$$ The function tagger gave this SBAR an ADV tag, indicating an unspecified adverbial function.

In function labeling level, EXT that signifies degree, amount of the predicates should be grouped into adverbials like in the work of (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000) and (Merlo and Musillo, 2005). $$$$$ It is as yet unclear just to what degree these tagging errors in the corpus are affecting our results.

As in the work of (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000) and (Merlo and Musillo, 2005), to avoid calculating excessively optimistic values, constituents bearing the O label are not counted in for computing overall precision, recall and F-score. $$$$$ In this case, that means excluding those constituents that were already wrong in the parser output; the parser we used attains 89% labelled precision-recall, so roughly 11% of the constituents are excluded from the function tag accuracy evaluation.

A trivial difference is that in our system the head for prepositional phrases is defined as the prepositions themselves (not the head of object of prepositional phrases (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000)), because we think that the preposition itself is a more distinctive attribute for different semantic meanings. $$$$$ The form/function tags help to find those constituents behaving in ways not conforming to their labelled type, as well as further clarifying the behaviour of adverbial phrases.

Blaheta and Charniak (2000) presented the first method for assigning Penn functional tags to constituents identified by a parser. $$$$$ Assigning Function Tags To Parsed Text
Blaheta and Charniak (2000) presented the first method for assigning Penn functional tags to constituents identified by a parser. $$$$$ This work presents a method for assigning function tags to text that has been parsed to the simple label level.

As an alternative to hard coded heuristics, Blaheta and Charniak (2000) proposed to recover the Penn functional tags automatically. $$$$$ This paper details a process by which some of this information—the function tags— may be recovered automatically.
As an alternative to hard coded heuristics, Blaheta and Charniak (2000) proposed to recover the Penn functional tags automatically. $$$$$ To our knowledge, there has been no attempt so far to recover the function tags in parsing treebank text.

Thus, it is informative to compare our results with those reported in (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000) for this same task. $$$$$ Both are reported below.
Thus, it is informative to compare our results with those reported in (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000) for this same task. $$$$$ Because of the lack of prior research on this task, we are unable to compare our results to those of other researchers; but the results do seem promising.

The difference in the accuracy is due to two reasons. First, because of the different definition of a correctly identified constituent in the parser? s output, we apply our method to a greater portion of all labels produced by the parser (95% vs. 89% reported in (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000)). $$$$$ In this case, that means excluding those constituents that were already wrong in the parser output; the parser we used attains 89% labelled precision-recall, so roughly 11% of the constituents are excluded from the function tag accuracy evaluation.

TiMBL performed well on tasks where structured, more complicated and task-specific statistical models have been used previously (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000). $$$$$ We have found it useful to define our statistical model in terms of features.

Many researchers ((Blaheta and Charniak 2000), (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000), showed that lexical and syntactic information is very useful for predicate argument recognition tasks, such as semantic roles. $$$$$ The Penn treebank contains a great deal of additional syntactic and semantic information from which to gather statistics; reproducing more of this information automatically is a goal which has so far been mostly ignored.
Many researchers ((Blaheta and Charniak 2000), (Gildea and Jurafsky 2000), showed that lexical and syntactic information is very useful for predicate argument recognition tasks, such as semantic roles. $$$$$ These are characterised by much more semantic information, and the relationships between lexical items are very important, making sparse data a real problem.

 $$$$$ The definition we chose is to call a constituent correct if there exists in the correct parse a constituent with the same start and end points, label, and function tag (or lack thereof).
 $$$$$ • There is no reason to think that this work could not be integrated directly into the parsing process, particularly if one's parser is already geared partially or entirely towards feature-based statistics; the function tag information could prove quite useful within the parse itself, to rank several parses to find the most plausible.

While the function of a constituent and its structural position are often correlated, they some (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000) talk of function tags. $$$$$ A constituent can be tagged with multiple tags, but never with two tags from the same category.1 In actuality, the case where a constituent has tags from all four categories never happens, but constituents with three tags do occur (rarely).

Following (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000), we refer to the first class as syntactic function labels, and to the second class as semantic function labels. $$$$$ In the Penn treebank, there are 20 tags (figure 1) that can be appended to constituent labels in order to indicate additional information about the syntactic or semantic role of the constituent.
Following (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000), we refer to the first class as syntactic function labels, and to the second class as semantic function labels. $$$$$ A 'feature', in this context, is a boolean-valued function, generally over parse tree nodes and either node labels or lexical items.

Like previous work (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000), we complete the sets of syntactic and semantic labels by labelling constituents that do not bear any function label with a NULL label. $$$$$ 'this node's label is X', 'this node's parent's label is Y'), or slightly more complex (`this node's head's partof-speech is Z').

Following (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000), incorrectly parsed constituents will be ignored (roughly 11% of the total) in the evaluation of the precision and recall of the function labels, but not in the evaluation of the parser. $$$$$ In this case, that means excluding those constituents that were already wrong in the parser output; the parser we used attains 89% labelled precision-recall, so roughly 11% of the constituents are excluded from the function tag accuracy evaluation.

In work that predates the availability of Framenet and Propbank, (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000) define the task of function labelling for the first time and highlight its relevance for NLP. $$$$$ We have found it useful to define our statistical model in terms of features.

Blaheta and Charniak (2000) assume a richer input representation consisting of labelled trees produced by a tree bank grammar parser, and use the tree bank again to train a further procedure that assigns grammatical function tags to syntactic constituents in the trees. $$$$$ We assume this to be the case for our feature trees.

Blaheta and Charniak (2000) report an F-score of 87% for assigning grammatical function tags to constituents, but the task, and therefore the scoring method, is rather different. $$$$$ Assigning Function Tags To Parsed Text
