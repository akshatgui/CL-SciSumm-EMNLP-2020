Our choice of metrics was based on their popularity in the MT community, their performance in open competitions such as the NIST Metrics MATR challenge (NIST, 2008) and the WMT shared evaluation task (Callison-Burch et al, 2010), their availability, and their relative complementarity. $$$$$ This builds on four previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009), and one previous MetricsMATR meeting (Przybocki et al., 2008).
