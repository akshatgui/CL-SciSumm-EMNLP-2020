Xiaofeng et al. (2004) or Strube and Müller (2003) have shown the feasibility of decision trees for the domain of anaphora resolution; we have chosen this approach as it makes it possible to easily switch the information set for training and evaluation as opposed to e.g. rewriting rule sets. $$$$$ This paper describes the extensions and adaptations needed for applying our anaphora resolution system (M¨uller et al., 2002; Strube et al., 2002) to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue.

Strube and Mu?ller (2003) propose a similar idea, but aim instead at finding a subset of the available features with which the resulting coreference classifier yields the best clustering-level accuracy on held-out data. $$$$$ We again choose the best performing classifier and add the corresponding new feature to the model.
Strube and Mu?ller (2003) propose a similar idea, but aim instead at finding a subset of the available features with which the resulting coreference classifier yields the best clustering-level accuracy on held-out data. $$$$$ The baseline model performs very well on this data set (the low recall figure is due to the fact that the 3mf data set contains only a small subset of the coreference links expected by the evaluation).

This suggests that a robust model of discourse structure could complement current robust interpretation systems, which tend to focus on only one aspect of the semantically ambiguous material, such as pronouns (e.g., Strube and Muller (2003)), definite descriptions (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)), or temporal expressions (e.g., Wiebe et al (1998)). $$$$$ This paper describes the extensions and adaptations needed for applying our anaphora resolution system (M¨uller et al., 2002; Strube et al., 2002) to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue.
