Our approach to QC follows that of (Li and Roth, 2002). $$$$$ The paper is organized as follows

We will use the TREC dataset provided by Li and Roth (2002), which assigns 6000 questions with both a coarse and a fine-grained label. $$$$$ The first classifies questions into coarse classes (Coarse Classifier) and the second into fineclasses (Fine Classifier).
We will use the TREC dataset provided by Li and Roth (2002), which assigns 6000 questions with both a coarse and a fine-grained label. $$$$$ Then each coarse class label in C 1 is expanded to a fixed set of fine classesdetermined by the class hierarchy.

This scheme is more suitable here than other common answer-typing schemata such as the one in Li and Roth (2002), which tend to focus on questions asking for factual knowledge. $$$$$ The intension is that this 1We do not address questions like ?Do you have a light??, which calls for an action, but rather only factual Wh-questions.

This is important because while large sets of existing questions can be obtained (Li and Roth, 2002), there are many fewer questions with available answers. Our experiments demonstrate that how-question specific unit lists consistently achieve higher answer identification performance than fixed-type, general purpose answer typing (which propose all numerical entities as answer candidates). $$$$$ of the sought after answer.

For example, Li and Roth (2002) assign one of fifty possible types to a question based on features present in the question. $$$$$ To avoid this problem,we allow our classifiers to assign multiple class la bels for a single question.
For example, Li and Roth (2002) assign one of fifty possible types to a question based on features present in the question. $$$$$ A question can be mapped to one of 50 pos sible classes (We call the set of all possible class labels for a given question a confusion set (Golding and Roth, 1999)).

(Li and Roth, 2002) obtain a better performance for English, around a 92.5% in terms of accuracy. $$$$$ As the results show, there is no perfor mance advantage for using a level of coarse classes, and the semantically appealing coarse classes do not contribute to better performance.

It could be also interested to test the combination between a better QC system, the current one by Li and Roth's for instance (Li and Roth, 2002), and our machine translation method. $$$$$ This method is better than only allowing one label because we can apply all the classes in the later precessing steps without any loss.

Our findings corroborate Li and Roth (2002), who report little benefit from adding head chunk features for the fine classification task. $$$$$ One difficulty in the question classification task is that there is no completely clear boundary between classes.

 $$$$$ In future work we plan to investigate further the application of deeper semantic analysis (including better named entity and semantic categorization) to feature extraction, automate the generation of thesemantic features and develop a better understand ing to some of the learning issues involved in thedifference between a flat and a hierarchical classi fier.
