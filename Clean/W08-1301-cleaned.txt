In English, this kind of typed dependencies has been introduced by de Marneffe and Manning (2008) and de Marneffe et al (2006). $$$$$ These were used as a starting point for developing the Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006).

While previous work uses the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit to identify characters and extract typed dependencies for them, we found this approach to be too slow for the scale of our data (a total of 1.8 billion tokens); in particular, syntactic parsing, with cubic complexity in sentence length, and out-of-the-box co reference resolution (with thousands of potential antecedents) prove to be 3All categories are described using the Stanford typed dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), but any syntactic formalism is equally applicable. $$$$$ The Stanford Typed Dependencies Representation

Bjorne et al. showed that deep dependency analyses in the well-established Stanford Dependency (SD) scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) can successfully be utilised in extracting graphs that express semantic entities as node sand relationship arguments as edges but are limited to one node per syntactic token. $$$$$ Here, we discuss only the latter representation; see (de Marneffe et al., 2006) for a discussion of both options and the precise relationship between them.

The native Penn TreeBank output of Bikel's and McClosky's parser was converted to the Stanford Dependency (SD) collapsed dependency format (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ Figures 1 and 2 give the full dependency output from SD and GR, respectively.

In this stage, we connect the triggers extracted with appropriate arguments using rules defined with the Stanford dependency (SD) scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ The primary focus of the SD scheme, however, has been to offer grammatical relations appropriate for end-users.
In this stage, we connect the triggers extracted with appropriate arguments using rules defined with the Stanford dependency (SD) scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ Then for each grammatical relation, patterns are defined over the phrase structure parse tree using the tree-expression syntax defined by tregex (Levy and Andrew, 2006).

More recent approaches to compression introduce reordering and paraphrase operations (e.g. ,dencies (Briscoe, 2006) while there are over 50 Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ These were used as a starting point for developing the Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006).

In this paper, we describe 1) a new dependency conversion (Section 3) of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, et al, 1993) along with the associated dependency label scheme, which is based upon the Stanford parser's popular scheme (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008), and a fast, accurate dependency parser with non-projectivity support (Section 4) and additional integrated semantic annotation modules for automatic preposition sense disambiguation and noun compound interpretation (Section 5). $$$$$ First, we noted how frequently WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) gets used compared to other resources, such as FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) or the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

We now describe how we build the syntactic relatedness trie (SRT) that forms the scaffolding for the probabilistic models needed to identify sentiment-bearing words via syntactic constraints extracted from a dependency parse (Kubler et al, 2009). We use the Stanford Parser (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) to produce a dependency graph and con sider the resulting undirected graph structure over words. $$$$$ The open information extraction system TEXTRUNNER (Banko et al., 2007) also makes use of the SD graph representation

3.3.1 Dependency Structures The first set of these features include typed dependency structures (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) which describe the grammatical relationships between words. $$$$$ Another example is the prepositional phrase where alternative attachment structures are indicated by different relations.

As recent work in the BioNLP 2009 shared task has shown (Kim et al,2009), domain-adapted parsing benefits information extraction systems. The native output of the C&C parser is converted into the Stanford Dependency (SD) collapsed dependency format (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008). $$$$$ Recent work on parser evaluation using dependency graphs in the biomedical domain confirms that researchers regard dependency-based evaluation as a more useful surrogate for extrinsic task-based evaluation (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007a).

We also establish the applicability of the PropBank scheme to the clinical sub language with its many atypical characteristics, and finally, we find that the PropBank scheme is compatible with the Stanford Dependency scheme of de Marneffeand Manning (2008a; 2008b) in which the under lying tree bank is annotated. $$$$$ Finally, we address the question of the suitability of the Stanford scheme for parser evaluation.

In so far, recovering SD relations from phrase-structure (PS) trees have used a range of structural cues such as positions and phrase-labels (see, for instance, the software of de Marneffe and Manning (2008a)). $$$$$ The Stanford parser4 comes with a tool, described in (de Marneffe et al., 2006), which provides for the rapid extraction of the grammatical relations from phrase structure parses.
