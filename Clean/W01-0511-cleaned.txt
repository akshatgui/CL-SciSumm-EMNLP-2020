In previous work (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), we demonstrated the utility of using a lexical hierarchy for assigning relations to two-word noun compounds. $$$$$ Classifying The Semantic Relations In Noun Compounds Via A Domain-Specific Lexical Hierarchy
In previous work (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), we demonstrated the utility of using a lexical hierarchy for assigning relations to two-word noun compounds. $$$$$ In Section 5 we describe the method for automatically assigning semantic relations to noun compounds, and report the results of experiments using this method.

Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ Classifying The Semantic Relations In Noun Compounds Via A Domain-Specific Lexical Hierarchy
Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain-specific lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees. $$$$$ In particular, we used neural networks to classify across all relations simultaneously. shown in boldface are those used in the experiments reported on here.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound. $$$$$ Classifying The Semantic Relations In Noun Compounds Via A Domain-Specific Lexical Hierarchy
Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound. $$$$$ We have found that we can use such algorithms to classify relationships between two-word noun compounds with a surprising degree of accuracy.

This includes the seminal paper of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), Senseval and Conll competitions on automatic labeling of semantic roles detection of noun compound semantics (Lapata, 2000), (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) and many others. $$$$$ Thus, we think this is a promising approach for a variety of semantic labeling tasks.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) constructed feature vectors for each noun modifier pair using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) as lexical resources. $$$$$ The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a biomedical lexical resource produced and maintained by the National Library of Medicine (Humphreys et al., 1998).
Rosario and Hearst (2001) constructed feature vectors for each noun modifier pair using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) as lexical resources. $$$$$ In Table 3 we report the length of the feature vectors for one noun for each model.

In other methods, lexical resources are specifically tailored to meet the requirements of the domain (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) or the system (Gomez, 1998). $$$$$ Classifying The Semantic Relations In Noun Compounds Via A Domain-Specific Lexical Hierarchy
In other methods, lexical resources are specifically tailored to meet the requirements of the domain (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) or the system (Gomez, 1998). $$$$$ Because the data is sparse, empirical methods that train on word occurrences alone (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) have been supplanted by algorithms that generalize one or both of the nouns according to classmembership measures (Resnik, 1993; Resnik and Hearst, 1993; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Li and Abe, 1998), but the statistics are computed for the particular preposition and verb.

This approach was used by Rosario and Hearst (2001) within a specific domain - medical texts. $$$$$ Classifying The Semantic Relations In Noun Compounds Via A Domain-Specific Lexical Hierarchy
This approach was used by Rosario and Hearst (2001) within a specific domain - medical texts. $$$$$ We find that a very simple approach using a machine learning algorithm and a domain-specific lexical hierarchy successfully generalizes from training instances, performing better on previously unseen words than a baseline consisting of training on the words themselves.

 $$$$$ We tried to produce relations that correspond to the linguistic theories such as those of Levi and Warren, but in many cases these are inappropriate.

(Rosario and Hearst 2001) focused on the medical domain making use of a lexical ontology and standard machine learning techniques. $$$$$ Our approach differs from these in that we are using machine learning techniques to determine which level of the lexical hierarchy is appropriate for generalizing across nouns.
(Rosario and Hearst 2001) focused on the medical domain making use of a lexical ontology and standard machine learning techniques. $$$$$ The main idea is to define a set of relations that can hold between the terms and use standard machine learning techniques and a lexical hierarchy to generalize from training instances to new examples.

Rosario and Hearst (2001) used a discriminative classifier to assign 18 relations for noun compounds from biomedical text, achieving 60% accuracy. $$$$$ One of the important challenges of biomedical text, along with most other technical text, is the proliferation of noun compounds.
Rosario and Hearst (2001) used a discriminative classifier to assign 18 relations for noun compounds from biomedical text, achieving 60% accuracy. $$$$$ In this task of multi-class classification (with 18 classes) we achieved an accuracy of about 60%.

For example, Rosario and Hearst (2001) propose 18 abstract relations for interpreting NCs in biomedical text, e.g., DEFECT, MATERIAL, PERSON AFFILIATED, ATTRIBUTE OF CLINICAL STUDY. $$$$$ One of the important challenges of biomedical text, along with most other technical text, is the proliferation of noun compounds.

Domain noun compound semantics, including static relations, have been considered in studies by (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) and (Nakov et al, 2005), but in IE settings static relations tend to appear only implicitly, as in the RelEx causal RE system of (Fundel et al, 2007), or through the causal relations they imply $$$$$ These relations are intended to be combined to produce larger propositions that can then be used in a variety of interpretation paradigms, such as abductive reasoning (Hobbs et al., 1993) or inductive logic programming (Ng and Zelle, 1997).
