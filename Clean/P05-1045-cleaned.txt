Finkel et al (2005) used simulated annealing with Gibbs sampling to find a solution in a similar situation. $$$$$ To verify the effectiveness of Gibbs sampling and simulated annealing as an inference technique for hidden state sequence models, we compare Gibbs and Viterbi inference methods for a basic CRF, without the addition of any non-local model.

We also conduct experiments using simulated annealing in decoding, as conducted by Finkel et al (2005) for information extraction. $$$$$ By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference.

To compute the features which we extract in the next section, all instances in our data sets were part-of-speech tagged by the MXPOST tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), parsed with the MaltParser, and named entity tagged with the Stanford NE tagger (Finkel et al, 2005). $$$$$ As an example, several authors (see Section 8) mention the value of enforcing label consistency in named entity recognition (NER) tasks.

One such technique is Markov chain Monte Carlo, and in particular Gibbs sampling (Finkel et al, 2005), another is (loopy) sum-product belief propagation (Smith and Eisner,2008). $$$$$ Thus it is called a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method; see Andrieu et al. (2003) for a good MCMC tutorial.

We run the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al, 2005) and record the number of PERSONs, ORGANIZATIONs, and LOCATIONs. $$$$$ The results, given in Table 1, show that if the Gibbs sampler is run long enough, its accuracy is the same as a Viterbi decoder.

For the learning of patterns we used the top 64 documents retrieved by Google and to recognize the named entities in the pattern we apply several strategies, namely: 1) the Stanford's Conditional Random-Field-based named entity recognizer (Finkel et al, 2005) to detect entities of type HUMAN; 2) regular expressions to detect NUMERIC and DATE type entities; 3) gazetteers to detect entities of type LOCATION. $$$$$ This generates a extremely large number of overlapping candidate entities, which then necessitates additional templates to enforce the constraint that text subsequences cannot both be different entities, something that is more naturally modeled by a CRF.
