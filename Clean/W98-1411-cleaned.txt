Mellish et al (1998) (and subsequently Karamanis and Manurung 2002) advocate genetic algorithms as an alternative to exhaustively searching for the optimal ordering of descriptions of museum artefacts. $$$$$ The work was motivated by the needs of the ILEX system for generating descriptions of museum artefacts (in particular, 20th Century jewellery) [Mellish et al 98].
Mellish et al (1998) (and subsequently Karamanis and Manurung 2002) advocate genetic algorithms as an alternative to exhaustively searching for the optimal ordering of descriptions of museum artefacts. $$$$$ Figure 5 summarises the results for subtree swapping and the two genetic algorithms on a set of examples.

Following previous work (Mellish et al, 1998) we used a single fitness function that scored candidates based on their coherence. $$$$$ For instance, in our ILEX domain [Mellish et al 98] the system's goal is something very general like &quot;say interesting things about item X,' subject to length and coherence constraints&quot;.
Following previous work (Mellish et al, 1998) we used a single fitness function that scored candidates based on their coherence. $$$$$ The example text is now in a single paragraph, with a clear link from each sentence to the previous ones.

The genetic algorithms of Mellish et al (1998) and Karamanis and Manarung (2002), as well as the greedy algorithm of Lapata (2003), provide no theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the solutions they propose. $$$$$ In the next section, we describe a couple of methods based on genetic algorithms which proved more productive.

For example, the measure from (Mellish et al, 1998) looks at the entire discourse up to the current transition for some of their cost factors. $$$$$ We also have a number of factors that we would like to take account of in the evaluation (see section 3 below).

Mellish et al (1998) advocate stochastic search as an alternative to exhaustively examining the search space. $$$$$ Stochastic search methods are a form of heuristic search that use the following generic algorithm

As in the case of Mellish et al (1998) we construct an acceptable ordering rather than the best possible one. $$$$$ This is not always the case.
As in the case of Mellish et al (1998) we construct an acceptable ordering rather than the best possible one. $$$$$ Marcu first of all attempts to find the best ordering of the facts.

Mellish et al (1998) made the point that even this restricted approach would soon become intractable with more than a small set of facts when one allows weak RST relations such as Joint and Elaboration into the model. $$$$$ In this task, one is given a set of facts all of which should be included in a text and a set of relations between facts, some of which can be included in the text.
Mellish et al (1998) made the point that even this restricted approach would soon become intractable with more than a small set of facts when one allows weak RST relations such as Joint and Elaboration into the model. $$$$$ With each example problem we have specified the number of facts, the number of elaboration relations and the number of non-elaboration relations.

The evaluation function of Mellish et al (1998) also was calculated over a sum of local features of the tree, although a wider set of features were involved. $$$$$ We assign a candidate tree a score which is the sum of scores for particular features the tree may have.

For instance, the evaluation function of Mellish et al (1998) assigned +3 for each instance of subject-repetition. $$$$$ For instance, in our ILEX domain [Mellish et al 98] the system's goal is something very general like &quot;say interesting things about item X,' subject to length and coherence constraints&quot;.
For instance, the evaluation function of Mellish et al (1998) assigned +3 for each instance of subject-repetition. $$$$$ It is necessary to be careful in evaluating these results, which are only as good as the evaluation function.

Genetic algorithms are also used in [Mellish et al, 1998] where the authors state the problem of given a set of facts to convey and a set of rhetorical relations that can be used to link them together, how one can arrange this material so as to yield the best possible text. $$$$$ Marcu has characterised an important and difficult problem in text planning
