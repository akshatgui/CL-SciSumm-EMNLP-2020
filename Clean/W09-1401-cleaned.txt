The BioNLP 09 Shared Task on Event Extraction (Kim et al, 2009), the first large scale evaluation of biomedical event extraction systems, drew the participation of 24 groups and established a standard event representation scheme and datasets. $$$$$ However, as both express the same event, in the shared task evaluation either alternative was accepted as correct extraction of the event.

To estimate the capacity of the newly annotated resource to support the extraction of the targeted PTM events and the performance of current event extraction methods at open-domain PTM extraction, we performed a set of experiments using an event extraction method competitive with the state of the art, as established in the BioNLP shared task on event extraction (Kim et al, 2009a; Bjorne et al., 2009). $$$$$ The BioNLP task targets semantically rich event extraction, involving the extraction of several different classes of information.

We note that while these results fall notably below the best result reported for Phosphorylation events in the BioNLP shared task, they are comparable to the best results reported in the task for Regulation and Binding events (Kim et al, 2009a), suggesting that the dataset allows the extraction of the novel PTM events with Theme and Site arguments at levels comparable to multi-argument shared task events. $$$$$ Regulation events always take a Theme argument and, when expressed, also a Cause argument.

Lee et al (2008) present E3Miner, a tool for automatically extracting information related to ubiquitination, and Kim et al (2009b) present a preliminary study adapting the E3Miner approach to the mining of acetylation events. It should be noted that while studies targeting single specific PTM types report better results than found in the initial evaluation presented here (in many cases dramatically so), different 25extraction targets and evaluation criteria complicate direct comparison. $$$$$ The evaluation results are reported using the standard recall/precision/f-score metrics, under different criteria defined through the equalities.
