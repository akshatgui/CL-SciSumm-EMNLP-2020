There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text $$$$$ Aligning parallel texts has recently received considerable attention (Warwick et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993).
There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text $$$$$ These methods have been used in machine translation (Brown et al., 1990; Sadler, 1989), terminology research and translation aids (Isabelle, 1992; Ogden and Gonzales, 1993), bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990), collocation studies (Smadja, 1992), word-sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991b; Gale et al., 1992) and information retrieval in a multilingual environment (Landauer and Littman, 1990).

This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ Aligning parallel texts has recently received considerable attention (Warwick et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993).
This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ This iterative process is known as the EM algorithm and has been shown to converge to a stationary point (Baum, 1972; Dempster et al., 1977).

This concept of alignment has been also used for tasks like automatic vocabulary derivation and corpus alignment (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ Aligning parallel texts has recently received considerable attention (Warwick et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993).
This concept of alignment has been also used for tasks like automatic vocabulary derivation and corpus alignment (Dagan et al, 1993). $$$$$ We sampled the English vocabulary with frequency between three and 450 occurrences, the same vocabulary that was used for alignment.

In Ido Dagan et al (1993) noisy points were filtered out by deleting frequent words. $$$$$ Aligning parallel texts has recently received considerable attention (Warwick et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993).
In Ido Dagan et al (1993) noisy points were filtered out by deleting frequent words. $$$$$ The thresholds are set to exclude the most frequent function words and punctuations, as well as words with less than 3 occurrences.

However, (Dagan et al, 1993) have shown that knowledge of target-text length is not crucial to the model's performance. $$$$$ Aligning parallel texts has recently received considerable attention (Warwick et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993).
However, (Dagan et al, 1993) have shown that knowledge of target-text length is not crucial to the model's performance. $$$$$ The tool depends crucially on the results of an alignment program to determine which parts of the source text correspond with which parts of the target text.

In the recent years, there have been a number of papers considering this or similar problems $$$$$ Aligning parallel texts has recently received considerable attention (Warwick et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991a; Gale and Church, 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991a; Kay and Rosenschein, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993).

 $$$$$ Word_align thus provides an example how a model such as Brown et al. 's Model 2, that was originally designed for research in statistical machine translation, can be modified to achieve practical, though less ambitious, goals in the near term.
