Wiebe et al (2004) show that low-frequency words and some collocations are a good indicators of subjectivity. $$$$$ Many good clues of subjectivity occur with low frequency (Wiebe, McKeever, and Bruce 1998).

Hedging is sometimes classed under the umbrella concept of subjectivity, which covers a variety of linguistic phenomena used to express differing forms of authorial opinion (Wiebe et al, 2004). $$$$$ In our terminology, a potential subjective element (PSE) is a linguistic element that may be used to express subjectivity.
Hedging is sometimes classed under the umbrella concept of subjectivity, which covers a variety of linguistic phenomena used to express differing forms of authorial opinion (Wiebe et al, 2004). $$$$$ In addition, quoted-speech sentences in which individuals express their subjectivity are often included (Barzilay et al. 2000).

This phenomenon, together with others used to express forms of authorial opinion, is often classified under the notion of subjectivity (Wiebe et al, 2004), (Shanahan et al, 2005). $$$$$ In addition, quoted-speech sentences in which individuals express their subjectivity are often included (Barzilay et al. 2000).

In contrast to the findings of Wiebe et al ((Wiebe et al, 2004)), who addressed the broader task of subjectivity learning and found that the density of other potentially subjective cues in the context benefits classification accuracy, we observed that the co-occurence of speculative cues in a sentence does not help in classifying a term as speculative or not. $$$$$ Question-answering systems should distinguish between factual and speculative answers.

On the other hand, Wiebe et al (2004) have noted that hap ax legomena (terms that only appear once in a collection of texts) are good signs for detecting subjectivity. $$$$$ The first are hapax legomena, the set of words that appear just once in the corpus.

Accurate automatic analysis of these aspects of language will augment existing research in the fields of sentiment (Pang et al, 2002) and subjectivity analysis (Wiebe et al, 2004), but assessing the usefulness of analysis algorithms leveraging the Appraisal framework will require test data. $$$$$ To perform automatic subjectivity analysis, good clues must be found.

We used three opinion-related data sets for our analyses and experiments $$$$$ Opinion-piece data are used for training, and (a different set of) opinion-piece data and the subjective-element data are used for testing.
We used three opinion-related data sets for our analyses and experiments $$$$$ Multiple trainingvalidation data set pairs are used for each test set, as given in Table 7.

This paper is also not concerned with subjectivity (Wiebe et al, 2004), the nature of the proposition p (statement about interior world or external world) is not of interest, only whether the writer wants the reader to believe the writer believes p. $$$$$ For example, the source of fascinating in (4) is the writer, while the source of the subjective elements in (5) is Maher (according to the writer).

Subjectivity lexicon (Wiebe et al, 2004) is a resource that annotates words with tags like parts-of-speech, prior polarity, magnitude of prior polarity (weak/strong), etc. $$$$$ In addition, quoted-speech sentences in which individuals express their subjectivity are often included (Barzilay et al. 2000).

For example, detecting subjective sentences, expressions, and other opinionated items in documents representing certain press categories (Wiebe et al, 2004) and measuring strength of subjective clauses (Wilson et al, 2004). $$$$$ The proportion of clues in subjective documents or expressions is their precision.

Wiebe et al (2004) proposed that whether a sentence is subjective or objective should be discriminated according to the adjectives in it. $$$$$ Sentences were annotated according to the coding instructions of Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara (1999) which, recall, are to classify a sentence as subjective if there is a significant expression of subjectivity of either the writer or someone mentioned in the text, in the sentence.
Wiebe et al (2004) proposed that whether a sentence is subjective or objective should be discriminated according to the adjectives in it. $$$$$ At the sentence level, Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara (1999) developed a machine learning system to classify sentences as subjective or objective.

We believe that this relaxation can be done in that particular case, as adjectives are much more likely to convey opinions a priori than verbs (Wiebe et al 2004). $$$$$ There is one small difference for adjectives and verbs noted in the figure, that is, the precision threshold of 0.28 for adjectives versus 0.23 for verbs.
We believe that this relaxation can be done in that particular case, as adjectives are much more likely to convey opinions a priori than verbs (Wiebe et al 2004). $$$$$ The results are for the union of the adjectives (verbs) chosen for each pair.

 $$$$$ The counts are of tokens (i.e., instances or occurrences) of members of S. Why use a set rather than individual items?
