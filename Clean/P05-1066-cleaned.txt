This result was found to be significant (p= 0.021) under the paired bootstrap resampling method of Koehn (2004), and is close to significant (p= 0.058) under the sign test of Collins et al (2005). $$$$$ Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system.

Our best performing method used unsupervised morphology with L-match (see Section 2.2) and the improvement is significant: bootstrap resampling provides a confidence margin of 0.77 and a t-test (Collins et al, 2005) showed significance with p= 0.001. $$$$$ Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system.

We parse the input using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) and apply a set of reordering rules to re-arrange the German sentence so that it corresponds more closely English word order (Collins et al, 2005). $$$$$ In our approach we reorder the constituents in a parse of the German sentence to give the following word order, which is much closer to the target English word order (words which have been “moved” are underlined): We applied our approach to translation from German to English in the Europarl corpus.

We are aware of two methods that have been proposed for significance testing with BLUE: bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004b; Zhang et al, 2004) and the sign test (Collins et al, 2005). $$$$$ More recently, phrase-based models (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models.
