This result was found to be significant (p= 0.021) under the paired bootstrap resampling method of Koehn (2004), and is close to significant (p= 0.058) under the sign test of Collins et al (2005). $$$$$ Results using the method show an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score to 26.8% Bleu score (a statistically significant improvement), using a phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003) which has been shown in the past to be a highly competitive SMT system.

We parse the input using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) and apply a set of reordering rules to re-arrange the German sentence so that it corresponds more closely English word order (Collins et al, 2005). $$$$$ In our approach we reorder the constituents in a parse of the German sentence to give the following word order, which is much closer to the target English word order (words which have been “moved” are underlined)

We are aware of two methods that have been proposed for significance testing with BLUE $$$$$ More recently, phrase-based models (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) have been proposed as a highly successful alternative to the IBM models.

Clause restructuring performed with hand-crafted reordering rules for German-to-English and Chinese-to-English tasks are presented in (Collins et al, 2005) and (Wang et al, 2007), respectively. $$$$$ Clause Restructuring For Statistical Machine Translation
