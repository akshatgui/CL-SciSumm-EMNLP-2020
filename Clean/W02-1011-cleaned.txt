For example, (Pang et al, 2002) collected reviews from a movie database and rated them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the rating (e.g., number of stars) given by the reviewer. $$$$$ Our data source was the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) archive of the rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup.3 We selected only reviews where the author rating was expressed either with stars or some numerical value (other conventions varied too widely to allow for automatic processing).

Sentiment classification is a special task of text classification whose objective is to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains (Pang et al, 2002), e.g., favorable or unfavorable, positive or negative. $$$$$ Our aim in this work was to examine whether it suffices to treat sentiment classification simply as a special case of topic-based categorization (with the two “topics” being positive sentiment and negative sentiment), or whether special sentiment-categorization methods need to be developed.

For evaluation, we use five sentiment classification datasets, including the widely-used movie review dataset [MOV] (Pang et al, 2002) as well as four datasets that contain reviews of four different types of product from Amazon [books (BOO), DVDs (DVD), electronics (ELE), and kitchen appliances (KIT)] (Blitzer et al, 2007). $$$$$ We used documents from the movie-review corpus described in Section 3.

Automatic identification of subjective content of ten relies on word indicators, such as unigrams (Pang et al, 2002) or predetermined sentiment lexica (Wilson et al, 2005). $$$$$ Another, more related area of research is that of determining the genre of texts; subjective genres, such as “editorial”, are often one of the possible categories (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997; Finn et al., 2002).

For the purpose of this work, we follow the definition of Pang et al (2002) and Turney (2002) and consider a binary classification task for output labels as positive and negative. $$$$$ We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative.

The low recall for adjective POS based synsets can be detrimental to classification since adjectives are known to express direct sentiment (Pang et al, 2002). $$$$$ Most previous research on sentiment-based classification has been at least partially knowledge-based.

Following standard practice in sentiment analysis (Pang et al, 2002), the input to SVMlight consisted of normalized presence-of-feature (rather than frequency-of-feature) vectors. $$$$$ In order to investigate whether reliance on frequency information could account for the higher accuracies of Naive Bayes and SVMs, we binarized the document vectors, setting ni(d) to 1 if and only feature fi appears in d, and reran Naive Bayes and SVMlight on these new vectors.11 As can be seen from line (2) of Figure 3, better performance (much better performance for SVMs) is achieved by accounting only for feature presence, not feature frequency.

Much of this research explores sentiment classification, a text categorization task in which the goal is to classify a document as having positive or negative polarity (e.g., Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al (2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al (2003), Pang and Lee (2004)). $$$$$ Another, more related area of research is that of determining the genre of texts; subjective genres, such as “editorial”, are often one of the possible categories (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997; Finn et al., 2002).

Previouswork has used machine learning techniques to identify positive and negative movie reviews (Pang et al., 2002). $$$$$ Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines.

Although the discriminative model (e.g., SVM) is proven to be more effective on unigrams (Pang et al, 2002) for its ability of capturing the complexity of more relevant features, WR features are more inclined to work better in the generative model (e.g., NB) since the feature independence assumption holds well in this case. $$$$$ Fi,c is a feature/class function for feature fi and class c, defined as follows
