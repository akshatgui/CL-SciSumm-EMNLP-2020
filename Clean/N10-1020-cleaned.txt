Recent studies have also developed approaches to summarize conversations (Murray and Carenini, 2008) and to model conversation structures (dialogue acts) from online Twitter conversations (Ritter et al, 2010). $$$$$ These acts are useful in many applications, including conversational agents (Wilks, 2006), dialogue systems (Allen et al., 2007), dialogue summarization (Murray et al., 2006), and flirtation detection (Ranganath et al., 2009).

Ritter et al (2010) extends LMHMM to allow words to be emitted from two additional sources $$$$$ These acts are useful in many applications, including conversational agents (Wilks, 2006), dialogue systems (Allen et al., 2007), dialogue summarization (Murray et al., 2006), and flirtation detection (Ranganath et al., 2009).
Ritter et al (2010) extends LMHMM to allow words to be emitted from two additional sources $$$$$ Rather than attempt to set them using an expensive grid search, we treat the concentration parameters as additional hidden variables and sample each in turn, conditioned on the current assignment to all other variables.

Ritter et al (2010) finds these alternate sources are important in non-task-oriented domains, where events are diffuse and fleeting. $$$$$ Automatic detection of dialogue structure is an important first step toward deep understanding of human conversations.

Ritter et al (2010) proposes an evaluation based on rank correlation coefficient, which measures the degree of similarity between any two orderings over sequential data. $$$$$ Therefore, we also propose a novel quantitative evaluation that measures the intrinsic quality of a conversation model by its ability to predict the ordering of posts in a conversation.

Ritter et al (2010) limits their dataset by choosing Twitter dialogues containing 3 to 6 posts (utterances), making it tractable to enumerate all permutations. $$$$$ The resulting corpus consists of about 1.3 million conversations, with each conversation containing between 2 and 243 posts.
