The BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (BioNLP ST 11) (Kim et al, 2011a), the follow-up event to the BioNLP 09 Shared Task (Kim et al, 2009), was organized from August 2010 (sample data release) to March 2011. $$$$$ Overview of Genia Event Task in BioNLP Shared Task 2011
The BioNLP Shared Task 2011 (BioNLP ST 11) (Kim et al, 2011a), the follow-up event to the BioNLP 09 Shared Task (Kim et al, 2009), was organized from August 2010 (sample data release) to March 2011. $$$$$ The task introduced in BioNLP-ST 2009 was renamed to Genia event (GE) task, and was hosted again in BioNLP-ST 2011, which also hosted four other IE tasks and three supporting tasks (Kim et al., 2011).

For compatibility with the BioNLP ST 09 and its repeat as the GE task in 2011 (Kim et al, 2011b), the REL task training/development/test set division of the GENIA corpus abstracts matches that of the BioNLP ST 09 data. $$$$$ Overview of Genia Event Task in BioNLP Shared Task 2011

Finally, we noted a number of cases that we judged to be errors in the gold annotation; the number is broadly in line with the reported inter-annotator agreement for the data (see e.g. Ohta et al (2011)).
