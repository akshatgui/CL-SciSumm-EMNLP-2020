On the one hand, the linguistically-based or rule-based approaches use linguistic information such as PoS tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop words and restrict candidate terms to predefined syntactic patterns (Ananiadou, 1994), (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ Candidate terms.

Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ Glossaries are extremely important for translation.
Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994). $$$$$ We have been using the output of word_align, a robust alignment program that proved useful for bilingual concordancing of noisy texts (Dagan et al., 1993).

Our system is most similar to Termight (Dagan and Church, 1994) and TransSearch (Macklovitch et al, 2000). $$$$$ Word alignment is newer, found only in a few places (Gale and Church, 1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993).
