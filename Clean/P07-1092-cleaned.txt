A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ The same experiment was repeated for en —* de translation with similar trends, except that the Germanic languages out-scored the Romance languages.

In statistical machine translation (SMT), methods that incorporate translations from other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) have proven effective in low-resource situations $$$$$ The idea of using multiple source languages for improving the translation quality of the target language dates back at least to Kay (1997), who observed that ambiguities in translating from one language onto another may be resolved if a translation into some third language is available.

Pivoting can finally be used to fix or improve the translation model $$$$$ In the example, four different target phrases are obtained, all of which are useful phrase-table entries.
Pivoting can finally be used to fix or improve the translation model $$$$$ We obtained similar results for en —* de.

One of them is often called triangulation and usually refers to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ As an example, consider Figure 1 which shows the coverage of unigrams and larger n-gram phrases when using a standard source target phrase-table, a triangulated phrase-table with one (it) and nine languages (all), and a combination of standard and triangulated phrase-tables (all+standard).
One of them is often called triangulation and usually refers to the combination of phrase tables (Cohn and Lapata, 2007). $$$$$ This augurs well for the combination of standard and triangulated phrase-tables, where diversity is valued.

For instance, (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) explore the use of triangulation for machine translation, where multiple translation models are learned using multilingual parallel corpora. $$$$$ Machine Translation by Triangulation

This finding might also carry over to phrase-table triangulation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007), where multi-parallel data is used in training to augment a standard translation system. $$$$$ Machine Translation by Triangulation

Cohn and Lapata (2007) explores how to utilize multilingual parallel data (rather than pivot data) to improve translation performance. $$$$$ In contrast to smoothing, our method alleviates data sparseness by exploring additional multiparallel data rather than adjusting the probabilities of existing data.
