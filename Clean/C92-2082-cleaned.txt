Hearst (1992) found individual pairs of hypernyms and hyponyms from text using pattern-matching techniques. $$$$$ Out of these, 152 relations fit tile re- strictions of the experiment, namely that both the hyponyms and the hypernyms are unmodified (with the exceptions mentioned above).

The hypernyms used to label the internal nodes of that hierarchy are chosen in a simple fashion; pattern-matching as in Hearst (1992) is used to identify candidate hypernyms of the words dominated by a particular node, and a simple voting scheme selects the hypernyms to be used. $$$$$ The patterns fotu~.d for this relation do not tend to uniquely identify it, but can be used to express other relations as well.

Regarding pattern-based approaches to identify and distinguish lexical semantic relations in more general terms, Hearst (1992) was the first to propose lexico-syntactic patterns as empirical pointers towards relation instances, focusing on hyponymy. $$$$$ We identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily rec- ognizable, that occur iYequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest.
