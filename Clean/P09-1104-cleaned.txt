In order to reduce spurious derivations, Wu (1997), Haghighi et al (2009), Liu et al (2010) propose different variations of the grammar. $$$$$ Initially, as in Taskar et al. (2005) and Moore et al.
In order to reduce spurious derivations, Wu (1997), Haghighi et al (2009), Liu et al (2010) propose different variations of the grammar. $$$$$ Wu (1997)’s inversion transduction grammar (ITG) is a synchronous grammar formalism in which derivations of sentence pairs correspond to alignments.

Haghighi et al (2009) give some restrictions on null-aligned word attachment. $$$$$ (2006), we assume the score a of a potential alignment a) decomposes as where sij are word-to-word potentials and siE and sEj represent English null and foreign null potentials, respectively.
Haghighi et al (2009) give some restrictions on null-aligned word attachment. $$$$$ Null productions are also a source of double counting, as there are many possible orders in which to attach null alignments to a bitext cell; we address this by adapting the grammar to force a null attachment order.

Four grammars were used to parse these alignments, namely LG (Wu, 1997), HaG (Haghighi et al, 2009), LiuG (Liu et al, 2010) and LGFN (Section 3.3). $$$$$ Initially, as in Taskar et al. (2005) and Moore et al.

To further study how spurious ambiguity affects the discriminative learning, we implemented a frame work following Haghighi et al (2009). $$$$$ In this work, we investigate large-scale, discriminative ITG word alignment.
To further study how spurious ambiguity affects the discriminative learning, we implemented a frame work following Haghighi et al (2009). $$$$$ Past work on discriminative word alignment has focused on the family of at-most-one-to-one matchings (Melamed, 2000; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006).

However, the space of block ITG alignments is expressive enough to include the vast majority of patterns observed in hand annotated parallel corpora (Haghighi et al, 2009). $$$$$ Indeed, blocks are the primary reason for gold alignments being outside the space of one-to-one ITG alignments.
However, the space of block ITG alignments is expressive enough to include the vast majority of patterns observed in hand annotated parallel corpora (Haghighi et al, 2009). $$$$$ We evaluate our proposed alignments (a) against hand-annotated alignments, which are marked with sure (s) and possible (p) alignments.

The best published results for this dataset are supervised, and trained on 17 times more data (Haghighi et al, 2009). $$$$$ All in all, our discriminatively trained, block ITG models produce alignments which exhibit the best AER on the NIST 2002 Chinese-English alignment data set.

Although this assumption does limit the space of possible word-level alignments, for the domain we consider (Chinese-English word alignment), the reduced space still contains almost all empirically observed alignments (Haghighi et al, 2009). $$$$$ Indeed, blocks are the primary reason for gold alignments being outside the space of one-to-one ITG alignments.
Although this assumption does limit the space of possible word-level alignments, for the domain we consider (Chinese-English word alignment), the reduced space still contains almost all empirically observed alignments (Haghighi et al, 2009). $$$$$ Then, When a* is an ITG alignment (i.e., m* is 0), M(a*) consists only of alignments which have all the sure alignments in a*, but may have some subset of the possible alignments in a*.

We begin with the same set of alignment features as Haghighi et al (2009), which are defined only for terminal bi spans. $$$$$ Initially, as in Taskar et al. (2005) and Moore et al.

Because of this, given a particular word alignment w, we maximize the marginal probability of the set of derivations A (w) that are consistent with w (Haghighi et al., 2009). $$$$$ We opt instead to maximize the probability of the set of alignments M(a*) which achieve the same optimal in-class loss.
