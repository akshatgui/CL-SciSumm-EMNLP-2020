 $$$$$ The sequence &quot;GC&quot; in a prosodic template is therefore an idiom for consonant gemination.
 $$$$$ In this paper, I hope I have shown how they can be applied to a problem in nonconcatenative morphology which seems initially to require heavier machinary.

One early approach, suggested by Kay (1987) and later pursued in different variants by Kiraz (1994, 2000) among others, was to, instead of modeling morphology along the more traditional finite-state transducer, modeling it with a n-tape automaton, where tapes would carry precisely this interleaving that is called for in Semitic interdigitation. $$$$$ Finite-state morphology appeals to the notion of a finite-state transducer, which is simply a classical finite-state automaton whose transitions are labeled with pairs, rather than with single symbols.

Kay (1987) devised a framework with which each of the auto segmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form. $$$$$ Finally, there will be an &quot;a&quot; on the tape containing the surface form.

A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ Nonconcatenative Finite-State Morphology
A strictly finite-state mechanism has a number of problems in covering natural language morphology, as has been recognized earlier (e.g. Kay (1987)). $$$$$ The intersection of these sets contains those pairs with some number of x's on one tape, and that same number of y's followed by the same number of z's on the other tape.
