Another approach (Hatzivassiloglou et al,1999) has been to use a machine learning algorithm in which features are based on combinations of simple features (e.g., a pair of nouns appear within 5 words from one another in both texts). $$$$$ Detecting Text Similarity Over Short Passages

We use SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al, 1999) for sentence clustering and the f-measure for word overlap to compare noun phrases. $$$$$ Matching noun phrases. the LINKIT tool [Wacholder 1998] to identify simplex noun phrases and match those that share the same head.

We use SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al, 1999) for sentence clustering and its similarity metric to evaluate cluster quality; SimFinder outputs similarity values (simvals) between 0 and 1 for pairs of sentences, based on word overlap, synonymy andn-gram matches. $$$$$ We thus consider following potential matches between text units

We then cluster the simplified sentences withSimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al, 1999). $$$$$ Our results indicate that our method outperforms the standard techniques for detecting similarity, and the system has been successfully integrated into a larger multipledocument summarization system [McKeown et al. 1999].

At the level of short passages or sentences, (Hatzivassiloglou et al, 1999) goes beyond N-gram, taking advantage of WordNet synonyms, as well as ordering and distance between shared words. $$$$$ Our include linked noun phrases, WordNet synonyms, and similar verbs.

For instance, Hatzivassiloglou et al (1999) trained a classifier for paraphrase detection, though their performance only reached roughly 37% recall and 61% precision. $$$$$ In comparison, the unmodified TF*IDF approach obtained only 32.6% precision when recall is 39.1%, i.e., close to our system's recall; and only 20.8% recall at precision of 62.2%, comparable to our classifier's ilarity metrics.

In the context of multi document summarization, SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al, 1999) identifies sentences that convey similar information across in put documents to select the summary content. $$$$$ We discuss a more restrictive definition of similarity than traditional, document-level and information retrieval-oriented, notions of similarity, and motivate it by showing its relevance to the multi-document text summarization problem.

Hatzivassiloglou et al (1999) proposed to use linguistic features as indicators of text similarity to address the problem of sparse representation of sentences. $$$$$ We address concerns of sparse data and the narrower than topical definition of similarity by exploring several linguistic features, in addition to shared words or collocations, as indicators of similarity.
