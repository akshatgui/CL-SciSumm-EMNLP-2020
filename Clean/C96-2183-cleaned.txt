The original motivation for sentence simplification is using it as a preprocessor to facilitate parsing or translation tasks (Chandrasekar et al., 1996). $$$$$ 3 FSG based Simplification (Chandrasekar, 1994) discusses an approach that uses a FSG for text simplification as part of a machine aided translation prototype named Vaakya.

Simplification decisions about whether to simplify a text or sentence have been studied following rule-based paradigms (Chandrasekar et al, 1996) or trainable systems (Petersen and Ostendorf,2007) where a corpus of texts and their simplifications becomes necessary. $$$$$ 3 FSG based Simplification (Chandrasekar, 1994) discusses an approach that uses a FSG for text simplification as part of a machine aided translation prototype named Vaakya.

Sentence simplification can also serve to preprocess the input of other tasks, such as summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2000), parsing, machine translation (Chandrasekar et al, 1996), semantic role labeling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008) or sentence fusion (Filippova and Strube, 2008). $$$$$ 3 FSG based Simplification (Chandrasekar, 1994) discusses an approach that uses a FSG for text simplification as part of a machine aided translation prototype named Vaakya.

Together with syntactic analysis and transformations similar to those of Chandrasekar et al (1996), they employed lexical simplification based on looking up synonyms in WordNet and extracting Kucera-Francis frequency from the Oxford Psycholinguistic Database (Quinlan, 1992). $$$$$ To overcome the limitations of full parsers, researchers have adopted FSG based approaches to parsing (Abney, 1994; Hobbs et al., 1992; Grishman, 1995).

Text simplification has been associated with techniques that deal not only with helping readers with reading disabilities, but also to help NLP systems (Chandrasekar et al, 1996). $$$$$ Henc.e, each word is associated with more than one supertag.
