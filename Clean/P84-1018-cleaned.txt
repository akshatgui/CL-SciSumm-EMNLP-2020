Some work has touched on shared knowledge of lexical semantics [aacobs, 1985, Steinacker and Buchberger, 19831 and on grammatical framework suitable for bidirectional systems [Kay, 1984]. $$$$$ Such a transfer grammar can readily capture all the components of the translation relation that have in fact been built into translation systems: correspondences between words and continuous or discontinuous phrases, use of selectional features or local contexts, case frames, reordering rules, lexical functions, compositional semantics, and so on.
Some work has touched on shared knowledge of lexical semantics [aacobs, 1985, Steinacker and Buchberger, 19831 and on grammatical framework suitable for bidirectional systems [Kay, 1984]. $$$$$ In particular, much of what falls under the umbrella of semantics in modern linguistics also fits conveniently within this framework.

As mentioned, FCG organises the information about an utterance in feature structures, similar to other feature-structure based formalisms (as first introduced by Kay (Kay, 1984)) but with some important differences. $$$$$ So Cat = S is a feature of the most elementary type.
As mentioned, FCG organises the information about an utterance in feature structures, similar to other feature-structure based formalisms (as first introduced by Kay (Kay, 1984)) but with some important differences. $$$$$ A phrase with this description cannot unify with the first clause in the grammar because its head has the feature [Head = NONE].

The family of grammar models that are based on such formalisms include Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) [Gazdar et al 1985], Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Bresnan 1982], Functional Unification Grammar (bUG) [Kay 1984], Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG) [Pollard and Sag 1988], and Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) [Karttunen 1986, Uszkoreit 1986, Zeevat et al 1987]. $$$$$ Functional Unification Grammar: A Formalism For Machine Translation
