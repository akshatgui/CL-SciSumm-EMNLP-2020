In our model, we adopted the subtree kernel method for the shortest path dependency kernel (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ We also show the results presented in (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) for their best performing kernel K4 (a sum between a bag-of-words kernel and their dependency kernel) under both scenarios.

It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the in formation required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ A Shortest Path Dependency Kernel For Relation Extraction
It has been shown in previous work on relation extraction that the shortest dependency path between any two entities captures the in formation required to assert a relationship between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ We present a novel approach to relation extraction, based on the observation thatthe information required to assert a rela tionship between two named entities in the same sentence is typically capturedby the shortest path between the two entities in the dependency graph.

The respective dependency parse tree is included through following the shortest dependency path hypothesis (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), by using the syntactical and dependency information of edges (e) and vertices (v). $$$$$ A Shortest Path Dependency Kernel For Relation Extraction
The respective dependency parse tree is included through following the shortest dependency path hypothesis (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), by using the syntactical and dependency information of edges (e) and vertices (v). $$$$$ In this paper we argued that the information relevant to relation extraction is almost entirely concentrated in the shortest path in the dependency tree, leading to an even smaller representation.

The information in the shortest path between two entities in a dependency tree can be used to assert whether a relationship exists between them (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005). $$$$$ Because local dependencies assemble into a tree for each sentence, there is onlyone (shortest) path between any two entities in a de pendency tree.
