This contribution has been built based on the data released for the Quality Estimation task of the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) 2012 (Callison-Burch et al, 2012). $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).

The two-scale scoring for adequacy and fluency used in NIST evaluation has been abandoned by some evaluation campaigns, most notably the WMT shared task series, see Koehn and Monz (2006) through Callison-Burch et al (2012) 1. $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).
The two-scale scoring for adequacy and fluency used in NIST evaluation has been abandoned by some evaluation campaigns, most notably the WMT shared task series, see Koehn and Monz (2006) through Callison-Burch et al (2012) 1. $$$$$ In the first human evaluation, we use fluency and adequacy judgments on a scale from 1 to 5 (Koehn and Monz, 2006).

Callison-Burch et al (2012) report for several automatic metrics on the whole WMT12 English-to-Czech dataset, the best of which correlates at?= 0.18. $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).

On the other hand, it is quite possible that the WMT-style rankings taken as the gold standard are of a disputable quality themselves, see Section 3.1 or the detailed report on inter annotator agreement and a long discussion on interpreting the rankings in Callison-Burch et al (2012). $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).

Nevertheless, in the context of this Quality Evaluation Shared task (see (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) for a detailed description) we have also used supervised learning as a final stage, in order to submit results which can be compared to other methods (see? 4). We investigate the use of various similarity measures for evaluating the quality of machine translated sentences. $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).

The TCD-M5P-resources-only submission ranked 5th (among 17) in the ranking task, and 5th among 19 (tied with two other systems) in the scoring task (Callison-Burch et al, 2012). Unfortunately the TCD-M5P-all submission contained an error.13 Below are the official results for TCD-M5P-resources-only and the corrected results for TCD-M5P-all $$$$$ TCD (R, S)

The WMT 2012 shared task on QE for MT (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) required participants to score and rank a set of automatic English to Spanish translations output by a state of-the-art phrase based machine translation system. $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).

An analysis of the Pearson correlation of the baseline features (Callison-Burch et al, 2012) with human quality assessments shows that the two strongest individual predictors of post-editing effort are the n-gram language model perplexities estimated on source and target sentences. $$$$$ This workshop builds on six previous WMT workshops (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2007; Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al., 2010; CallisonBurch et al., 2011).
