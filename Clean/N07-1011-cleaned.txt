Culotta et al (2007) present a system which uses an online learning approach to train a classifier to judge whether two entities are coreferential or not. $$$$$ Collins and Roark (2004) present an incremental perceptron algorithm for parsing that uses “early update” to update the parameters when an error is encountered.

In our study, we also tested the "Most-X" strategy for the first-order features as in (Culotta et al., 2007), but got similar results without much difference (±0.5% F-measure) in performance. $$$$$ This approach allows the update to only penalize the difference between the two features of examples, thereby not penalizing features representing any overlapping coreferent clusters.

The one exception is the size of a cluster (Culotta et al, 2007). $$$$$ In addition to the listed features, we also include conjunctions of size 2, for example “Genders match AND numbers match”.

Culotta et al (2007) also apply online learning in a first-order logic framework that enables non-local features, though using a greedy search algorithm. $$$$$ In this paper, we propose a machine learning method enables features over noun phrases, resulting in a first-order probabilistic model for coreference.

However, with the advent of the ACE data, many systems either evaluated only true mentions, i.e. mentions which are included in the annotation, the so-called key, or even received true information for mention boundaries, heads of mentions and mention type (Culotta et al, 2007, inter alia). $$$$$ All-X is true if all pairs share a feature X, Most-True-X is true if the majority of pairs share a feature X, and Most-False-X is true if most of the pairs do not share feature X.

As we show, this combination of a pairwise model and strong features produces a 1.5 percentage point increase in B-Cubed F-Score over a complex model in the state-of-the-art system by Culotta et al. (2007), although their system uses a complex, non-pairwise model, computing features over partial clusters of mentions. $$$$$ This restriction can be detrimental if there exist features of sets of noun phrases that cannot be captured by a combination of pairwise features.

Culotta et al (2007) introduced a model that predicts whether a pair of equivalence classes should be merged, using features computed over all the mentions in both classes. $$$$$ These include: The First-Order Model includes the following features: • Enumerate each pair of noun phrases and compute the features listed above.
