That is, we parse all sentences using the Charniak's parser (Charniak, 2001), relation instances are generated by iterating over all pairs of entity mentions occurring in the same sentence. $$$$$ Rather we interpolate the probabilities of the entire sentences.

The model presented by Charniak (Charniak, 2001) identifies both syntactic structural and lexical dependencies that aid in language modeling. $$$$$ Thus only p(h j t,l, m, u, i), the distribution for the head of c, looks at two lexical items (i and h itself), and none of the distributions look at three lexical items as do the trigram distribution of Equation 4 and the previously discussed parsing language models [4, 15].
The model presented by Charniak (Charniak, 2001) identifies both syntactic structural and lexical dependencies that aid in language modeling. $$$$$ We have presented two grammar-based language models, both of which significantly improve upon both the trigram model baseline for the task (by 24% for the better of the two) and the best previous grammar-based language model (by 14%).

The first stage is a PCFG word-lattice parser that generates a set of candidate parses over strings in a word-lattice, while the second stage rescores these candidate edges using a lexicalized syntactic language model (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ We also empirically checked that our individual distributions (p(t 1 l, m, u, i), and p(h 1 t,l, m, u, i) from Equation 5 and p(L 1 l, t, h, m, u), p(M 1 l, t, h, m, u), and p(R 1 l, t, h, m, u) from Equation 5) sum to one for a large, random, selection of conditioning events2 As with [3], a subset of parses is computed with a non-lexicalized PCFG, and the most probable edges (using an empirically established threshold) have their probabilities recomputed according to the complete probability model of Equation 5.

These parses are then rescored using a lexicalized syntactic model (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ We also empirically checked that our individual distributions (p(t 1 l, m, u, i), and p(h 1 t,l, m, u, i) from Equation 5 and p(L 1 l, t, h, m, u), p(M 1 l, t, h, m, u), and p(R 1 l, t, h, m, u) from Equation 5) sum to one for a large, random, selection of conditioning events2 As with [3], a subset of parses is computed with a non-lexicalized PCFG, and the most probable edges (using an empirically established threshold) have their probabilities recomputed according to the complete probability model of Equation 5.

These contexts include syntactic structure such as parent and grandparent category labels as well as lexical items such as the head of the parent or the head of a sibling constituent (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ The most obvious extension would be to condition upon not just one’s parent’s head, but one’s grandparent’s as well.
These contexts include syntactic structure such as parent and grandparent category labels as well as lexical items such as the head of the parent or the head of a sibling constituent (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ The reader may remember that h is the head of the current constituent, while i is the head of its parent.

The second stage parser used is a modified version of the Charniak language modeling parser described in (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ We have taken the immediate-head parser described in [3] as our starting point.

Charniak (Charniak, 2000) developed a state-of-the-art statistical CFG parser and then built an effective language model based on it (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ We present two language models based upon an “immediate-head” parser — our name for a parser that conditions events below a constituent head of While all of the most accurate statistical parsers are of the immediate-head variety, no previous grammatical language model uses this technology.
Charniak (Charniak, 2000) developed a state-of-the-art statistical CFG parser and then built an effective language model based on it (Charniak, 2001). $$$$$ In both cases the grammar based language model computes the probability of the next word based upon the previous words of the sentence.

Our system embeds Phramer2 (used for minimum error rate training, decoding, decoding tools), Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) (decoding), Carmel 3 (helper for Pharaoh in n-best generation), Charniak's parser (Charniak, 2001) (language model) and SRILM4 (n-gram LM construction). $$$$$ The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammarbased language model.

We used Charniak's parser as an additional LM (Charniak, 2001) in reranking. $$$$$ See [3] for all the details on the equations as well as the smoothing used. of one or more such symbols.

Hall and Johnson (2003) use a best-first probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) to parse the input lattice, pruning to a set of local trees (candidate partial parse trees), which are then passed to a version of the parser of Charniak (2001) for more refined parsing. $$$$$ We break up a traditional probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) rule into a left-hand side with a label l(c) drawn from the non-terminal symbols of our grammar, and a right-hand side that is a sequence 1We simplify slightly in this section.

The parses were automatically produced by the parser of Charniak (2001). $$$$$ Based upon a few observations on sentences from the development corpus for which the trigram model gave higher probabilities we hypothesized that reason (3), bungled parses, is primary.

The current best-performing models, in terms of WER, for the HUB-1 corpus, are the models of Roark (2001), Charniak (2001) (applied to n-best lists by Hall and Johnson (2003)), and the SLM of Chelba and Jelinek (2000) (applied to n-best lists by Xu et al (2002)). $$$$$ We see that the grammar perplexity is reduced to 130.20, a reduction of 10% over our first model, 14% over the previous best grammar model (152.26%), and 22% over the best of the above trigram models for the task (167.02).

Hall (2003) is a lattice-parser related to Charniak (2001). $$$$$ The research presented in this paper is most closely related to two previous efforts, that by Chelba and Jelinek [4] (C&J) and that by Roark [15], and this review concentrates on these two papers.

The difference in WER between our parser and those of Charniak (2001) and Roark (2001) applied to word lists may be due in part to the lower PARSEVAL scores of our system. $$$$$ Note, however, that because our parser does not define probabilities for each word based upon previous words (as with trigram) it is not possible to do the integration at the word level.

Another contributing factor to the accuracy of Charniak (2001) is the size of the training set: 20M words larger than that used in this work. $$$$$ As in previous work, files F0 to F20 are used for training, F21-F22 for development, and F23-F24 for testing.
Another contributing factor to the accuracy of Charniak (2001) is the size of the training set: 20M words larger than that used in this work. $$$$$ The grammar model and the trigram model capture different facts about the distribution of words in the language, and for some set of sentences one distribution will perform better than the other.

We use a syntax-based language model which was originally developed for use in speech recognition (Charniak, 2001) and later adapted to work with a syntax-based machine translation system (Charniaket al, 2001). $$$$$ Virtually all current speech recognition systems use the so-called trigram language model in which the probability of a string is broken down into conditional probabilities on each word given On the other hand, in the last few years there has been interest in designing language models based upon parsing and Equation 2.

Noun noun (adjective noun, respectively) sequences of words were extracted using the Lauer heuristic (Lauer 1995) which looks for consecutive pairs of nouns that are neither preceded nor succeeded by a noun after each sentence was syntactically parsed with Charniak parser (Charniak, 2001) (for XWN we used the gold parse trees). $$$$$ Sometimes the immediate head of a constituent occurs after it (e.g, in noun-phrases, where the head is typically the rightmost noun) and thus is not available for conditioning by a strict left-to-right parser.
