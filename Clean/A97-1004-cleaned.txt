finding sentence boundaries (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997). $$$$$ We present two systems for identifying sentence boundaries.

This data was sentence-segmented using MxTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and parsed with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ The parameters are chosen to maximize the likelihood of the training data, using the Generalized Iterative Scaling (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) algorithm.
This data was sentence-segmented using MxTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and parsed with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003). $$$$$ We corrected punctuation mistakes and erroneous sentence boundaries in the training data.

We trained a publicly available sentence splitter (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) on a small manually annotated sample (1,000 sentences per domain per language) and applied it to our corpora. $$$$$ Many freely available natural language processing tools require their input to be divided into sentences, but make no mention of how to accomplish this (e.g.
We trained a publicly available sentence splitter (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) on a small manually annotated sample (1,000 sentences per domain per language) and applied it to our corpora. $$$$$ Since 39441 training sentences is considerably more than might exist in a new domain or a language other than English, we experimented with the quantity of training data required to maintain performance.

We also used MXTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) for sentence segmentation, MINIPAR (Lin, 1993) for lemmatization and dependency parsing, and MATLAB3 for SVD computation. $$$$$ However, these punctuation marks are not used exclusively to mark sentence breaks.
We also used MXTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) for sentence segmentation, MINIPAR (Lin, 1993) for lemmatization and dependency parsing, and MATLAB3 for SVD computation. $$$$$ The model used here for sentence-boundary detection is based on the maximum entropy model used for POS tagging in (Ratna.parkhi, 1996).

Sentence segmentation Off-the-shelf sentence segmentators tend to be trained on newswire texts (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), which significantly differ from the noisy text in our corpus. $$$$$ Performance on the WSJ corpus was, as we expected, higher than performance on the Brown corpus since we trained the model on financial newspaper text.
Sentence segmentation Off-the-shelf sentence segmentators tend to be trained on newswire texts (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), which significantly differ from the noisy text in our corpus. $$$$$ For example, Riley's performance on the Brown corpus is higher than ours, but his system is trained on the Brown corpus and uses thirty times as much data as our system.

Another statistical system, mxTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) employs simpler lexical features of the words to the left and right of the candidate period. $$$$$ We use information about the token containing the potential sentence boundary, as well as contextual information about the tokens immediately to the left and to the right.

One common objection to supervised SBD systems is an observation in (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), that training data and test data must be a good match, limiting the applicability of a model trained from a specific genre. $$$$$ The model can therefore be trained easily on any genre of English, and should be trainable on any other Romanalphabet language.

Many alternatives suggest themselves to expand the options, including maximum entropy models, which have been previously successfully applied to, inter alia, sentence boundary detection (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), and transformation-based learning, as used in part-of-speech tagging and statistical parsing applications (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ A Maximum Entropy Approach To Identifying Sentence Boundaries

As the text part may consist of more than one sentence, we first perform sentence splitting using Mxterminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), a maximum 83 entropy-based end of sentence classifier trained onthe Penn Treebank data. $$$$$ A Maximum Entropy Approach To Identifying Sentence Boundaries

We have tokenized the text using the Grok-OpenNLP tokenizer (Morton, 2002) and split the sentences using MXTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997). $$$$$ On first glance, it may appear that using a short list, of sentence-final punctuation marks, such as ., ?, and !, is sufficient.
