A more complex set of temporal expressions as extracted by recent systems (e.g. (Mani and Wilson, 2000)) was tagged. $$$$$ It is worth noting that there are several kinds of temporal expressions that are not to be tagged, and that other expressions tagged as a time expression are not assigned a value, because doing so would violate the simplicity and preciseness requirements.

In the system presented in (Mani and Wilson, 2000), weekday name interpretation is implemented as part of a sequence of interpretation rules for temporal expression interpretation more generally. $$$$$ The intention here is to capture the information in the text while leaving further interpretation of the Values to applications using the markup.

As a result, many timex interpretation systems are a mixture of both rule-based and machine learning approaches (Mani and Wilson, 2000). $$$$$ Our approach has been to develop initial rules by hand, conduct an initial evaluation on an unseen test set, determine major errors, and then handling those errors by augmenting the rule set with additional rules discovered by machine learning.

Mani and Wilson (2000) attribute over half the errors of their baseline method to propagation of an incorrect event time to neighboring events. $$$$$ Over half the errors were due to propagation of spreading of an incorrect event time to neighboring events; about 15% of the errors were due to event times preceding the initial TIMEX expression (here the initial reference time should have been used); and at least 10% of the errors were due to explicitly marked tense switches.
