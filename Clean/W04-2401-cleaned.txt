A similar method was used for entity/relation recognition (Roth and Yih, 2004). $$$$$ In named entity recognition, “no entities can overlap” is a common constraint used in various works (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).
A similar method was used for entity/relation recognition (Roth and Yih, 2004). $$$$$ Lt.) name3 the phrase is/has a known person’s name For the relation classifier, there are three sets of features: (1) features similar to those used in the entity classification are extracted from the two argument entities of the relation; (2) conjunctions of the features from the two arguments; (3) some patterns extracted from the sentence or between the two arguments.

Supervised methods such as (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and (Roth and Yih, 2004) provide only a partial solution, as there are many possible relations and entities of interest for a given domain, and such approaches require new annotated data each time a new relation or entity type is needed. $$$$$ Given n entities in a sentence, there are O(n2) possible relations between them.

Our model for disentanglement fits into the general class of graph partitioning algorithms (Roth and Yih, 2004) which have been used for a variety of tasks inNLP, including the related task of meeting segmentation (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006). $$$$$ The correspondence between the relation and entity variables can be represented by a bipartite graph.

Roth and Yih (2004) use log probabilities as weights. $$$$$ The specific cost function we use is defined as follows: Let l be the label assigned to variable u ∈ V. If the marginal probability estimation is p = P(fu = l), then the assignment cost cu(l) is − log p. Constraint cost: the cost imposed by breaking constraints between neighboring nodes.
Roth and Yih (2004) use log probabilities as weights. $$$$$ We use softmax (Bishop, 1995) over the raw activation values as conditional probabilities.

Our problem formulation and use of ILP are based on both (Roth and Yih, 2004) and (Barzilay and Lapata, 2006). $$$$$ Our LP formulation is based on the method proposed by (Chekuri et al., 2001).

Also, we minimize rather than maximize due to the fact we transform the model probabilities with? log (like Roth and Yih (2004)). $$$$$ In fact, as will be clear in Sec.

Roth and Yih (2004) use ILP to deal with the joint inference problem of named entity and relation identification. $$$$$ V. Oswald was murdered at JFK after his assassin, R. U. KFJ...” This task requires making several local decisions, such as identifying named entities in the sentence, in order to support the relation identification.

We phrase the inference task as an integer linear program (ILP) following the approach developed in Roth and Yih (2004). $$$$$ Following this work, we model inference as an optimization problem, and show how to cast it as a linear program.
We phrase the inference task as an integer linear program (ILP) following the approach developed in Roth and Yih (2004). $$$$$ When the coefficient matrix of a given linear program in its standard form is unimodular, it can be shown that the optimal solution to the linear program is in fact integral (Schrijver, 1986).

The approach we develop in this paper follows the one proposed by Roth and Yih (2004) of training individual models and combining them at inference time. $$$$$ We develop our models in the context of natural language inferences and evaluate it here on the problem of simultaneously recognizing named entities and relations between them.

Roth and Yih (2004) advocated ILP as a general solution for a number of NLP tasks that re quire combining multiple classifiers and which the traditional pipeline architecture is not appropriate, such as entity disambiguation and relation extraction. $$$$$ That is, replacing (6), (7), and (8) with: If LPR returns an integer solution, then it is also the optimal solution to the ILP problem.

Few of many examples include type constraints between relations and entities (Roth and Yih, 2004), sentential and modifier constraints during sentence compression (Clarke and Lapata,2006), and agreement constraints between word alignment directions (Ganchev et al, 2008) or various parsing models (Koo et al, 2010). $$$$$ Examples of these constraints include the type of arguments a relation can take, and the mutual activity of different relations, etc.

Integer linear programs have already been successfully used in related fields including semantic role labelling (Punyakanok et al, 2004), relation and entity classification (Roth and Yih, 2004), sentence compression (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) and dependency parsing (Martins et al, 2009). $$$$$ Our approach could be contrasted with other approaches to sequential inference or to general Markov random field approaches (Lafferty et al., 2001; Taskar et al., 2002).

Recently, [Roth and Yih, 2004] applied an ILP model to the task of the simultaneous assignment of semantic roles to the entities mentioned in a sentence and recognition of the relations holding between them. $$$$$ 3 the language for defining constraints is very rich – linear (in)equalities over V. We exemplify the framework using the problem of simultaneous recognition of named entities and relations in sentences.

Roth and Yih (2004) also described a classification-based framework in which they jointly learn to identify named entities and relations. $$$$$ This, in turn, may help to identify that the kill action is described in the sentence.
Roth and Yih (2004) also described a classification-based framework in which they jointly learn to identify named entities and relations. $$$$$ This approach first trains an entity classifier as described in the basic approach, and then uses the prediction of entities in addition to other local features to learn the relation identifier.

(Roth and Yih, 2004) suggests a model in which global constraints are taken into account in a later stage to fix mistakes due to the pipeline. $$$$$ The predictions are taken as input on the inference procedure which then finds the best global prediction.
