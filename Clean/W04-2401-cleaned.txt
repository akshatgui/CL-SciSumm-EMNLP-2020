Supervised methods such as (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and (Roth and Yih, 2004) provide only a partial solution, as there are many possible relations and entities of interest for a given domain, and such approaches require new annotated data each time a new relation or entity type is needed. $$$$$ Given n entities in a sentence, there are O(n2) possible relations between them.

Our model for disentanglement fits into the general class of graph partitioning algorithms (Roth and Yih, 2004) which have been used for a variety of tasks inNLP, including the related task of meeting segmentation (Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006). $$$$$ The correspondence between the relation and entity variables can be represented by a bipartite graph.

Roth and Yih (2004) use ILP to deal with the joint inference problem of named entity and relation identification. $$$$$ V. Oswald was murdered at JFK after his assassin, R. U. KFJ...” This task requires making several local decisions, such as identifying named entities in the sentence, in order to support the relation identification.

We phrase the inference task as an integer linear program (ILP) following the approach developed in Roth and Yih (2004). $$$$$ When the coefficient matrix of a given linear program in its standard form is unimodular, it can be shown that the optimal solution to the linear program is in fact integral (Schrijver, 1986).

The approach we develop in this paper follows the one proposed by Roth and Yih (2004) of training individual models and combining them at inference time. $$$$$ We develop our models in the context of natural language inferences and evaluate it here on the problem of simultaneously recognizing named entities and relations between them.

Roth and Yih (2004) advocated ILP as a general solution for a number of NLP tasks that re quire combining multiple classifiers and which the traditional pipeline architecture is not appropriate, such as entity disambiguation and relation extraction. $$$$$ That is, replacing (6), (7), and (8) with

Few of many examples include type constraints between relations and entities (Roth and Yih, 2004), sentential and modifier constraints during sentence compression (Clarke and Lapata,2006), and agreement constraints between word alignment directions (Ganchev et al, 2008) or various parsing models (Koo et al, 2010). $$$$$ Examples of these constraints include the type of arguments a relation can take, and the mutual activity of different relations, etc.

Roth and Yih (2004) also described a classification-based framework in which they jointly learn to identify named entities and relations. $$$$$ This, in turn, may help to identify that the kill action is described in the sentence.
Roth and Yih (2004) also described a classification-based framework in which they jointly learn to identify named entities and relations. $$$$$ This approach first trains an entity classifier as described in the basic approach, and then uses the prediction of entities in addition to other local features to learn the relation identifier.

(Roth and Yih, 2004) suggests a model in which global constraints are taken into account in a later stage to fix mistakes due to the pipeline. $$$$$ The predictions are taken as input on the inference procedure which then finds the best global prediction.
