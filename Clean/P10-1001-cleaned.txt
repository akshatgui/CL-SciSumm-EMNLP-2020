For example, Koo and Collins (2010) and Zhang and McDonald (2012) show that incorporating higher-order features into a graph-based parser only leads to modest increase in parsing accuracy. $$$$$ Following standard practice for higher-order dependency parsing (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007), Models 1 and 2 evaluate not only the relevant third-order parts, but also the lower-order parts that are implicit in their third-order factorizations.

As some important relationships were represented as siblings and some as grandparents, there was a need to develop third-order parsers which could exploit both simultaneously (Koo and Collins, 2010). $$$$$ In dependency grammar, syntactic relationships are represented as head-modifier dependencies

While previous work using third order factors, cf. Koo and Collins (2010), was restricted to unlabeled and projective trees, our parser can produce labeled and non-projective dependency trees. $$$$$ As a final note, the parsing algorithms described in this section fall into the category of projective dependency parsers, which forbid crossing dependencies.
