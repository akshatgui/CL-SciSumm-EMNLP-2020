Approaches such as harvesting parallel corpora from the web (Resnik and Smith, 2003) address the creation of data. $$$$$ Smith (2002) suggested a bootstrapping paradigm for the construction of parallel corpora.

Besides, there are also some other types of methods for mining parallel corpora from the web such as the work in (Resnik, 1998), (Resnik and Smith, 2003) and (Zhang et al, 2006). $$$$$ More recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have been exploring new ways to exploit parallel corpora in order to develop monolingual resources and tools, using a process of annotation, projection, and training

Unfortunately, parallel corpora are not readily available in large quantities, except for a small subset of the world's languages (see Resnik and Smith (2003) for discussion), therefore limiting the potential use of current SMT systems. $$$$$ Unfortunately, they are not readily available in the necessary quantities.

For example, Resnik and Smith (2003) propose mining the web to collect parallel corpora for low-density language pairs. $$$$$ Finally, the value of these techniques is demonstrated in the construction of a significant parallel corpus for a low-density language pair.

Most existing studies, such as Nie (1999), Resnik and Smith (2003) and Shi (2006), mine parallel web documents within bilingual web sites first and then extract bilingual sentences from mined parallel documents using sentence alignment method. $$$$$ The Web As A Parallel Corpus
Most existing studies, such as Nie (1999), Resnik and Smith (2003) and Shi (2006), mine parallel web documents within bilingual web sites first and then extract bilingual sentences from mined parallel documents using sentence alignment method. $$$$$ Within such sites, it would likely be profitable to look for parallel documents in the full cross product of documents in the two languages of interest, obtained both on the Internet Archive and via crawling all pages on relevant sites.

Resnik and Smith (2003) exploit the similarities in URL structure, document structure and other clues for mining the Web for parallel documents. $$$$$ We do not attempt to exploit nonlinear structure (e.g., embedded chunks), for two reasons.
Resnik and Smith (2003) exploit the similarities in URL structure, document structure and other clues for mining the Web for parallel documents. $$$$$ All these considerations motivate an approach to matching translations that pays attention to similarity of content, whether or not similarities of structure exist.

Earlier work on corpus collection from the web (e.g. (Resnik and Smith, 2003)) gave some hope that reasonably large quantities of parallel text could be found on the web, so that a bitext collection could be built for interesting language pairs(with one member of the pair usually being English) relatively cheaply. $$$$$ The Web As A Parallel Corpus

At the other end of the spectrum, Resnik and Smith (2003) search the Web to detect web pages that are translations of each other. $$$$$ Its goal is to identify pairs of Web pages that are mutual translations.

Resnik and Smith (2003) use a similar idea of candidates and filters in their STRAND system. $$$$$ STRAND therefore locates pages that might be translations of each other, via a number of different strategies, and filters out page pairs whose page structures diverge by too much.
Resnik and Smith (2003) use a similar idea of candidates and filters in their STRAND system. $$$$$ A modified version of STRAND was used to obtain English-Chinese pairs (see related work, below), and in a similar formal evaluation, we found that the resulting set had 98% precision and 61% recall for Chinese (http

These approaches are in essence a combination of the usage of lexico-syntactic pattens conveying a certain relation of interest such as in (Hearst, 1992), (Charniak and Berland, 1999), (Iwanska et al, 2000) or (Poesio et al, 2002) with the idea of using the web as a big corpus (Resnik and Smith, 2003), (Grefenstette, 1999), (Keller et al, 2002). $$$$$ More recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have been exploring new ways to exploit parallel corpora in order to develop monolingual resources and tools, using a process of annotation, projection, and training

Due to its significant growth, the WWW has become an attractive database for different systems applications as, machine translation (Resnik and Smith, 2003), question answering (Kwok et al, 2001), commonsense retrieval (Matuszek et al, 2005), and so forth. $$$$$ More recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have been exploring new ways to exploit parallel corpora in order to develop monolingual resources and tools, using a process of annotation, projection, and training

Another approach to retrieving relevant documents involves the collection of relevant document URLs from the WWW (Resnik and Smith, 2003). $$$$$ Within such sites, it would likely be profitable to look for parallel documents in the full cross product of documents in the two languages of interest, obtained both on the Internet Archive and via crawling all pages on relevant sites.
Another approach to retrieving relevant documents involves the collection of relevant document URLs from the WWW (Resnik and Smith, 2003). $$$$$ A solution to this problem might be to extract topically relevant subsets of the collection for particular domains or applications, but of course this requires a “more is better” approach in order to obtain subsets that are large enough to be useful.

This is for instance the case of PTMINER (Chen and Nie, 2000) and STRAND (Resnik and Smith, 2003), two systems that are intended to mine parallel documents over the Web. $$$$$ Similarly, Nie and Cai (2001) have demonstrated improved cross-language IR results for English and Chinese using data gathered by the PTMiner system (Chen and Nie 2000), a related approach that we discuss in Section 2.3.
