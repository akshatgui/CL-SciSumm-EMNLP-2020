Using this intuition, state-of-the-art systems first build a parse tree, and syntactic constituents are then labeled by feeding hand-built features extracted from the parse tree to a machine learning system, e.g. the ASSERT system (Pradhan et al, 2004). $$$$$ Path ?

Because ASSERT uses a parser, and because PropBank was built by labeling the nodes of a hand-annotated parse tree, per node accuracy is usually reported in papers such as (Pradhan et al, 2004). $$$$$ Each node in the parse tree can be classified as eitherone that represents a semantic argument (i.e., a NONNULL node) or one that does not represent any seman tic argument (i.e., a NULL node).

We measured the argument classification accuracy of our network, assuming the correct segmentation is given to our system, as in (Pradhan et al, 2004), by post-processing our per-word tags to form a majority vote over each segment. $$$$$ However, we found that there was an improve ment in the CORE ARGUMENT accuracy on the combined task of identifying and assigning semantic arguments, given hand-corrected parses, whereas the accuracy of the ADJUNCTIVE ARGUMENTS slightly deteriorated.

For these reasons, we use a semantic role labeler (Pradhan et al, 2004) to provide and delimit the text spans that contain the semantic arguments of a predicate. $$$$$ The problem of shallow semantic parsing can be viewed as three different tasks.Argument Identification ?

A crucial difference from similar approaches, such as SRL with PropBank roles (Pradhan et al, 2004) is that by identifying relations as part of a frame, you have identified a gestalt of relations that enables far more inference, and sentences from the same passage that use other words from the same frame will be easier to link together. $$$$$ We will be reporting on results using PropBank1 (Kingsbury et al, 2002), a 300k-word corpus in which predi cate argument relations are marked for part of the verbsin the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al, 1994).
