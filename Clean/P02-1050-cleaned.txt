Analogously to Hwa et al (2002), we investigate whether there are indeed semantic correspondences between two languages, since there is little hope for projecting meaningful annotations in nonparallel semantic structures. $$$$$ As art example where the DCA relates dependency structures, consider the hierarchical alignment algorithm proposed by Alshawi et al.

We take as the starting point of annotation projection the direct correspondence assumption as formulated in (Hwa et al, 2002) $$$$$ In our experimental framework, a system is given the &quot;ideal&quot; syntactic analyses for the English sentences and English-Chinese word-alignments, and it uses a Direct Projection Algorithm (described below) to project the English syntactic annotations directly across to the Chinese sentences in accordance with the DCA.

Hwa et al (2002) have noticed that applying elementary linguistic transformations considerably increases precision and recall when projecting syntactic relations, at least for the English/Chinese language pair. $$$$$ The direct projection of English dependencies to Chinese yielded poor results as measured by precision and recall over unlabeled syntactic dependencies

In a different approach, Hwa et al (2002) aligned the parallel sentences using phrase based statistical MT models and then projected the alignments back to the parse trees. $$$$$ To our knowledge, the direct correspondence assumption underlies all statistical models that attempt to capture a relationship between syntactic structures in two languages, be they constituent models or dependency models.
