It might be the case that a larger k-best, or revisiting previous strategies for y+ and y− selection, such as bold updating, local updating (Liang et al, 2006b), or maxBLEU updating (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006) might have a greater impact. $$$$$ The block set is generated using a phrase-pair selection algorithm similar to (Koehn et al., 2003; Al-Onaizan et al., 2004), which includes some heuristic filtering to mal statement here.

Tillmann and Zhang (2006) use a BLEU oracle decoder for discriminative training of a local reordering model. $$$$$ Rather than predicting local block neighbors as in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) , here the model parameters are trained in a global setting.

The translation probability can also be discriminatively trained such as in Tillmann and Zhang (2006). $$$$$ Such probability features include language model, translation or distortion probabilities, which are commonly used in current SMT approaches 1.

Both Liang, et al (2006), and Tillmann and Zhang (2006) report on effective machine translation (MT) models involving large numbers of features with discriminatively trained weights. $$$$$ These features correspond to the use of a language model, but the weights for theses features are trained on the parallel training data only.

For instance, some max-margin methods restrict their computations to a set of examples from a feasible set, where they are expected to be maximally discriminative (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006). $$$$$ This block set is used to decode training sentence to obtain block orientation sequences that are used in the discriminative parameter training.

This is the main motivation of (Tillmann and Zhang,2006), where the authors compute high BLEU hypotheses by running a conventional decoder so as to maximize a per-sentence approximation of BLEU-4, under a simple (local) reordering models. $$$$$ Starting with a simple model, the training data is decoded multiple times: the weight vector is trained to discriminate block sequences with a high translation score against block sequences with a high BLEU score 2.
