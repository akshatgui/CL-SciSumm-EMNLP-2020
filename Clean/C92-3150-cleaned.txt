Bourigault &apos; s LECTER [Bourigault, 1992] is a surface-syntactic analyser that extracts &apos; maximal length noun phrases &apos; -mainly sequences of determiners, premodifiers, nominal heads, and certain kinds of post modifying prepositional phrases and adjectives from French texts for terminology applications. $$$$$ In the second stage, LEXTER parses these maximal-length noun phrases to extract subgroups which by virtue of their grammatical structure and their place in the maximal-length noun phrases are likely to be terminological units.

Some methods (Bourigault (1992), Ananiadou (1994)) rely purely on linguistic information, namely morpho-syntactic features of term candidates. $$$$$ This consensus i attested only when the occurrences of this linguistic expression, or term-to-be, shows a stable correlation to the same object in the subject field, uniquely and completely, in the writings of the agents of this scientific community.

On the grammar-based side, Bourigault (1992) describes a system for extracting& quot; terminological noun phrases& quot; from French text. $$$$$ This analysis phase produces a series of text sequences, most often noun phrases.

Bourigault (1992) reports a tool, LEXTER, for extracting terminologies from texts. $$$$$ In the first stage, LEXTER uses a base of rules designed to indentify frontier markers in view to analysing the texts and extracting maximal- length noun phrases.
