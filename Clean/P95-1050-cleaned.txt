Theoretically, it is possible to use these methods to build a translation lexicon from scratch [Rapp, 1995]. $$$$$ Word a in the English matrix is then the translation of word a in the German matrix.

Rapp (1995), Grefenstette (1998), Fung and Lo (1998), and Kaji (2003) derived bilingual lexicons or word senses from such corpora. $$$$$ In a number of recent studies it has been shown that word translations can be automatically derived from the statistical distribution of words in bilingual parallel texts (e. g. Catizone, Russell & Warwick, 1989; Brown et al., 1990; Dagan, Church & Gale, 1993; Kay & ROscheisen, 1993).

Rapp (1995) proposed a computationally demanding matrix permutation method which maximizes a similarity between co-occurrence matrices in two languages. $$$$$ The method proposed is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between the patterns of word cooccurrences in texts of different languages.
Rapp (1995) proposed a computationally demanding matrix permutation method which maximizes a similarity between co-occurrence matrices in two languages. $$$$$ The monotonically increasing character of the curves in figure 1 indicates that in principle it should be possible to find word correspondences in two matrices of different languages by randomly permuting one of the matrices until the similarity function s reaches a minimum and thus indicates maximum similarity.

In order to expand the dictionaries using a set of monolingual comparable corpora, the basic approach pioneered by Fung and McKeown (1997) and Rapp (1995, 1999) is to be further developed and refined in the second phase of the project as to obtain a practical tool that can be used in an industrial context. $$$$$ In order to limit the search space, translations that are known beforehand can be used as anchor points.

In particular, we extend the long line of work on inducing translation lexicons (beginning with Rapp (1995)) and propose to use multiple independent cues present in monolingual texts to estimate lexical and phrasal translation probabilities for large, MT-scale phrase-tables. $$$$$ Word a in the English matrix is then the translation of word a in the German matrix.

Rapp (1995) was the first to propose using non-parallel texts to learn the translations of words. $$$$$ Identifying Word Translations In Non-Parallel Texts
Rapp (1995) was the first to propose using non-parallel texts to learn the translations of words. $$$$$ Since the acquisition of non-parallel texts is usually much easier, it would be desirable to have a program that can determine the translations of words from comparable or even unrelated texts.

Previous research on bilingual lexicon induction learned translations only for a small number of high frequency words (e.g. 100 nouns in Rapp (1995), 1,000 most frequent words nouin Koehn and Knight (2002), or 2,000 most frequent nouns in Haghighi et al (2008)). $$$$$ In a number of recent studies it has been shown that word translations can be automatically derived from the statistical distribution of words in bilingual parallel texts (e. g. Catizone, Russell & Warwick, 1989; Brown et al., 1990; Dagan, Church & Gale, 1993; Kay & ROscheisen, 1993).

Building a dictionary from scratch is not possible this way or at least computationally un-feasible (see Rapp, 1995). $$$$$ This study suggests that the identification of word translations should also be possible with non-parallel and even unrelated texts.

Approaches for lexicon extraction from comparable corpora have been proposed that use the bag of-words model to find words that occur in similar lexical contexts (Rapp, 1995). $$$$$ If — for example — in a text of one language two words A and B co-occur more often than expected from chance, then in a text of another language those words which are translations of A and B should also co-occur more frequently than expected.
Approaches for lexicon extraction from comparable corpora have been proposed that use the bag of-words model to find words that occur in similar lexical contexts (Rapp, 1995). $$$$$ The common occurrence of two words was defined as both words being separated by at most 11 other words.

One of the first works in the area of comparable corpora mining was based on word co-occurrence based approach (Rapp, 1995). $$$$$ The method proposed is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between the patterns of word cooccurrences in texts of different languages.

Rapp (1995) suggested his idea about the usage of context vectors in order to find the words that are the translation of each other in comparable corpora. $$$$$ As the English vocabulary a list of 100 words was used, which had been suggested by Kent & Rosanoff (1910) for association experiments.

The underlying assumption is that translations of words that are related in one language are also related in the other language (Rapp 1995). $$$$$ If — for example — in a text of one language two words A and B co-occur more often than expected from chance, then in a text of another language those words which are translations of A and B should also co-occur more frequently than expected.

In this situation, Rapp (1995) proposed using a clue different from the three mentioned above $$$$$ However, in this paper it is further assumed that the co-occurrence patterns in original texts are not fundamentally different from those in translated texts.

By presupposing a lexicon of seed words, she avoids the prohibitively expensive computational effort encountered by Rapp (1995). $$$$$ The common occurrence of two words was defined as both words being separated by at most 11 other words.
