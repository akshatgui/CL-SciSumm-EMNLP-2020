(Fleischman et al., 2003) also propose a supervised algorithm that uses part of speech patterns and a large corpus to extract semantic relations for Who-is type questions. $$$$$ Our strategy is to collect a large sample of newspaper text (15GB) and use multiple part of speech patterns to extract the semantic relations.
(Fleischman et al., 2003) also propose a supervised algorithm that uses part of speech patterns and a large corpus to extract semantic relations for Who-is type questions. $$$$$ While this paper examines only this type of relation, the techniques we propose are easily extensible to other question types.

We also made use of the person-name/instance pairs automatically extracted by Fleischman et al (2003). $$$$$ The concept-instance pairs extracted using the above patterns are very noisy.
We also made use of the person-name/instance pairs automatically extracted by Fleischman et al (2003). $$$$$ Answers to these questions were then automatically generated both by look-up in the 2,000,000 extracted concept-instance pairs and by TextMap, a state of the art web-based Question Answering system which ranked among the top 10 systems in the TREC 11 Question Answering track (Hermjakob et al., 2002).

Mann (2002) and Fleischman et al (2003) used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involving proper nouns. $$$$$ Finally, Mann (2002) describes a method for extracting instances from text that takes advantage of part of speech patterns involving proper nouns.

Some of these patterns are similar to the ones discovered by Hearst (1992) while other patterns are similar to the ones used by Fleischman et al (2003). $$$$$ Such patterns (e.g.

Following Fleischman et al (2003), we select the 50 definition questions from the TREC2003 (Voorhees 2003) question set. $$$$$ 100 questions of the form “Who is x” were randomly selected from this set.

 $$$$$ We would also like to thank Andrew Philpot for his work on integrating instances into the Omega Ontology, and Daniel Marcu whose comments and ideas were invaluable.

We compared our system with the concepts in WordNet and Fleischman et al's instance/concept relations (Fleischman et al 2003). $$$$$ The algorithms are compared to a baseline filter that accepts concept-instance pairs if and only if the concept head is a descendent of either the concept “Human” or the concept “Occupation” in Omega.

This approach is similar in spirit to the work reported by Fleischman et al (2003) and Mann (2002), except that our system benefits from a greater variety of patterns and answers a broader range of questions. $$$$$ Our approach follows closely from Mann (2002).

The precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (Fleischman et al, 2003). $$$$$ We then filter out the noise from these extracted relations using a machine-learned classifier.
The precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (Fleischman et al, 2003). $$$$$ Finally, in order to address the Precision problem, we use machine learning techniques to filter the output of the part of speech patterns, thus purifying the extracted instances.

The recall problem is usually addressed by increasing the amount of text data for extraction (taking larger collections (Fleischman et al, 2003)) or by developing more surface patterns (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002). $$$$$ First, the patterns yield only a small amount of the information that may be present in a text (the Recall problem).

To get a clear picture of the impact of using different information extraction methods for the offline construction of knowledge bases, similarly to (Fleischman et al, 2003), we focused only on questions about persons, taken from the TREC8 through TREC 2003 question sets. $$$$$ Recent work in Question Answering has focused on web-based systems that answers using simple lexicosyntactic patterns.

This confirms the results of Fleischman et al (2003) $$$$$ Results of this comparison are presented in Figure 3.
This confirms the results of Fleischman et al (2003) $$$$$ Further, many question types require post processing.

In our future work we plan to investigate the effect of more sophisticated and, probably, more accurate filtering methods (Fleischman et al, 2003) on the QA results. $$$$$ Results of this comparison are presented in Figure 3.
In our future work we plan to investigate the effect of more sophisticated and, probably, more accurate filtering methods (Fleischman et al, 2003) on the QA results. $$$$$ In order to achieve real-time, accurate Question Answering, repositories of data much larger than that described here must be generated.

After that, several million instances of people, locations, and other facts were added (Fleischman et al, 2003). $$$$$ For the extracted instances, the answer was that concept-instance pair that appeared most frequently in the list of extracted examples.
