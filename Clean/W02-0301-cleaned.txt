Results of protein name recognition in Kazama et al (2002) using GENIA 1.1 are 0.492, 0.664 and 0.565 for precision, recall, f-score respectively. $$$$$ Nobata et al. (1999) and Collier et al.

In the case of term classification, Kazama et al (2002) used a more exhaustive feature set containing lexical information, POS tags, affixes and their combinations in order to recognise and classify terms into a set of general biological classes used within the GENIA project (GENIA, 2003). $$$$$ That is, given a part-of-speech tag set POS, we produce new

Experiments with augmented tag sets in the biomedical domain also show performance loss with respect to smaller tagsets; e.g., Kazama et al (2002) report an F score of 56.2% on a tag set of 25 Genia classes, compared to the 75.9% achieved on the simplest binary case. $$$$$ That is, given a part-of-speech tag set POS, we produce new
