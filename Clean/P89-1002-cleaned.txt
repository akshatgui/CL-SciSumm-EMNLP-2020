One of the termination problems Shieber et al (1989) pointed out is in the left-recursive rules. $$$$$ Existing generation algorithms have efficiency or termination problems with respect to certain classes of grammars.

Though the restriction can not be applied to languages like Dutch (Shieber et al, 1989), the limitation is irrelevant to our purpose (translation between Japanese and English). $$$$$ Finally, Calder et al. (1989) report on a generation algorithm for unification categorial grammar that appears to be a special case of ours.
Though the restriction can not be applied to languages like Dutch (Shieber et al, 1989), the limitation is irrelevant to our purpose (translation between Japanese and English). $$$$$ This is the correlate of the link relation used in left-corner parsers with topdown filtering; we direct the reader to the discussion by Matsumoto et al. (1983) or Pereira and Shieber (1985, p. 182) for further information.

The lexicon match is not based on direct unification of the target phrase's semantics with that of its head, a fundamental requirement of the bottom-up head-driven algorithm of Shieber et al (1989) and Van Noord (1990). $$$$$ A Semantic-Head-Driven Generation Algorithm For Unification-Based Formalisms
