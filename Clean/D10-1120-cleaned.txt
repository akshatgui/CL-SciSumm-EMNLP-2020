Unsupervised methods attempt to infer linguistic structure without using any annotated data (Klein and Manning, 2004) or possibly by using a set of linguistically motivated rules (Naseem et al, 2010) or a linguistically informed model structure (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010). $$$$$ The DMV results are taken from Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein (2010).
