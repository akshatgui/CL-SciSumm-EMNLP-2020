(Davidov et al, 2007) introduce the use of term frequency patterns for relationship discovery. $$$$$ If S is in fact related to X in some way, there might be a number of S-patterns that capture this relationship.

For example, Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2008) linked instantiations of a set of semantic relations into existing semantic ontologies and Davidov et al (2007) employed seed concepts from a given semantic class to discover relations shared by concepts in that class. $$$$$ We will generate a concept class and a variety of natural binary relations involving that class.

As a pre-requisite to extracting relations among pairs of classes, the method described in (Davidov et al., 2007) extracts class instances from unstructured Web documents, by submitting pairs of instances as queries and analyzing the contents of the top 1,000 documents returned by a Web search engine. $$$$$ In each stage we conducted queries iteratively, each time downloading all 1,000 documents for the query.

The evaluation methodology is also quite different, as the instance sets acquired based on the input seed instances in (Davidov et al, 2007) are only evaluated for three hand-picked classes, with precision scores of 90% for names of countries, 87% for fish species and 68% for instances of constellations. $$$$$ Of these, 87 names (77 constellations) are strings with no white space.
