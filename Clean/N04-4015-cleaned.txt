Another project utilizing morphological analysis for statistical machine translation is described by Lee (2004). $$$$$ We present a novel morphological analysis technique which induces a morphological and syntactic symmetry between two languages with highly asymmetrical morphological structures to improve statistical machine translation qualities.

Lee (2004), for example, showed that morphological analysis can improve the quality of statistical machine translation for Arabic. $$$$$ Morphological Analysis For Statistical Machine Translation

We found that our approach of using lemmatization improved both the word alignment and the quality of SMT with a small amounts of training data, and, while much work indicates that MA is useless in training large amounts of data (Lee, 2004), our intensive experiments proved that the chance to get a better MT quality using lemmatization is higher than that without it for large amounts of training data. $$$$$ Merge/deletion analysis is applied to all prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurring in the appropriate stem tag contexts in the training corpus (for translation model training) and a new input text (for decoding).

Often the choice of directionality is motivated by this restriction, and the choice of tokenization style may be designed (Lee, 2004) to reduce this problem. $$$$$ So called a word (separated by a white space) in Arabic often corresponds to more than one independent word in English, posing a technical problem to the source channel models.
Often the choice of directionality is motivated by this restriction, and the choice of tokenization style may be designed (Lee, 2004) to reduce this problem. $$$$$ We pre-suppose segmentation of a word into prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es), as described in (Lee et al. 2003) The category prefix and suffix encompasses function words such as conjunction markers, prepositions, pronouns, determiners and all inflectional morphemes of the language.

Lee (2004) uses a trigram language model to segment Arabic words. $$$$$ IBM Model 1, implements the idea that if a morpheme in one language is robustly translated into a distinct part-of-speech in the other language, the morpheme is very likely to have its independent counterpart in the other language.

 $$$$$ If a word token contains more than one prefix and/or suffix, we posit multiple prefixes/suffixes per stem.
 $$$$$ We would like to acknowledge Salim Roukos and Kishore Papineni for technical discussions.

For example, it has been shown (Lee, 2004) that determiner segmentation and deletion in Arabic sentences in an Arabic-to-English translation system improves sentence alignment, thus leading to improved overall translation quality. $$$$$ Arabic-English sentence alignment after Arabic word segmentation is illustrated in Figure 2, where one Arabic morpheme is aligned to one or zero English word.

Lee (2004) only changes the word segmentation of the morphologically complex language (Arabic) to induce morphological and syntactic symmetry between the parallel sentences. $$$$$ The technique pre-supposes fine-grained segmentation of a word in the morphologically rich language into sequence of and part-of-speech tagging of the parallel corpus.

Another way for determiner deletion is described in (Lee, 2004). $$$$$ One major asymmetry between Arabic and English is caused by more frequent use of the determiner Al# in Arabic compared with its counterpart the in English.
Another way for determiner deletion is described in (Lee, 2004). $$$$$ Unlike the automatic induction of morphological analysis described in 3.2.1, Al#-deletion analysis is manually induced.

For languages with more or less regular inflectional morphology like Arabic or Turkish, another good idea is to segment words into morpheme sequences, e.g., prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es), which can be used instead of the original words (Lee, 2004) or in addition to them. $$$$$ We first apply word segmentation to Arabic, segmenting a word into prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es).

Similarly, for Arabic-to-English, Lee (2004), and Habash and Sadat (2006) show that various segmentation schemes lead to improvements that decrease with increasing parallel corpus size. $$$$$ The technique improves Arabic-to-English translation qualities significantly when applied to IBM Model 1 and Phrase Translation Models trained on the training corpus size ranging from 3,500 to 3.3 million sentence pairs.

In Lee (2004), the goal is to match the lexical granularities of the two languages by starting with a fine-grained segmentation of the Arabic side of the corpus and then merging or deleting Arabic morphemes using alignments with a part-of-speech tagged English corpus. $$$$$ The technique pre-supposes fine-grained segmentation of a word in the morphologically rich language into sequence of and part-of-speech tagging of the parallel corpus.

Specifically considering Arabic, Lee (2004) investigated the use of automatic alignment of POS tagged English and affix-stem segmented Arabic to determine appropriate tokenizations. $$$$$ Arabic-English sentence alignment after Arabic word segmentation is illustrated in Figure 2, where one Arabic morpheme is aligned to one or zero English word.

Lee (2004) and Zolmann et al (2006) have exploited morphology in Arabic English SMT. $$$$$ Translation of two languages with highly different morphological structures as exemplified by Arabic and English poses a challenge to successful implementation of statistical machine translation models (Brown et al. 1993).

While comprehensive Arabic preprocessing schemes have been widely adopted for handling Arabic morphology in SMT (e.g., Sadat and Habash (2006), Zollmann et al (2006), Lee (2004)), syntactic issues have not received as much attention by comparison (Green et al). $$$$$ We apply Al#-deletion to Arabic noun phrases so that only the first occurrence of Al# in a noun phrase is retained.

Specially for Arabic-English translation, Lee (2004) used the Arabic part of speech and English parts of speech (POS) alignment probabilities to retain an Arabic affix, drop it from the corpus or merge it back to a stem. $$$$$ We also obtain translation probabilities of an English part-of-speech tag given each Arabic prefix/suffix and its part-of-speech according to (2) computes the translation probability of an Arabic suffix and its part-of-speech into an English part-of-speech in the Arabic stem tag context, stemtagA.
