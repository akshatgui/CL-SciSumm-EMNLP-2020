This paper considers differences in texts in the well known Penn TreeBank (hereafter, PTB) and in particular, how these differences show up in the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Prasad et al, 2008). $$$$$ The latter called the interval-based approach considers the temporal mutual information in different time stamps.

Genre differences at the level of discourse in the PTB can be seen in the manual annotations of the Penn Discourse TreeBank (Prasad et al, 2008). $$$$$ In the past, some useful collocation models (Manning & Sch?tze, 1999) have been proposed such as mean and variance, hypothesis test, mutual information, etc. Some works analyze the weblogs from the aspect of time like the dynamics of weblogs in time and location (Mei, et al, 2006), the weblog posting behavior (Doran, Griffith & Henderson, 2006; Hurst, 2006), the topic extraction (Oka, Abe & Kato, 2006), etc. The impacts of events on social media are also discussed, e.g., the change of weblogs after London attack (Thelwall, 2006), the relationship between the warblog and weblogs (Kim, 2005; Thompson, 2003), etc. This paper is organized as follows.

Later, with the release of manually annotated corpus, such as Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDTB) (Prasad et al, 2008), recent studies performed implicit discourse relation recognition on natural (i.e., genuine ) implicit discourse data (Pitler et al, 2009) (Lin et al,2009) (Wang et al, 2010) with the use of linguistically informed features and machine learning algorithms. $$$$$ The Penn Discourse TreeBank 2.0.
