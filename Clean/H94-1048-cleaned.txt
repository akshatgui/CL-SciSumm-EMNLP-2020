We did not use the PP data set described by (Ratnaparkhi et al, 1994) because we are using more context than the limited context available in that set (see below). $$$$$ Often the correct parse can be determined from the lexical properties of certain key words or from the context in which the sentence occurs.

For English, the average human performance on pp-attachment for the (v, n1, p, n2) problem formulation is just 88.2% when given only the four head-words, but increases to 93.2% when given the full sentence (Ratnaparkhi et al, 1994). $$$$$ In the first trial, they were given only the four head words to make the attachment decision, and in the next, they were given the headwords along with the sentence in which they occurred.

A year later (Ratnaparkhi et al, 1994) published a supervised approach to the PP attachment problem. $$$$$ Currently, the use of the mutual information class bits gives us a few percentage points in performance, but the ME model should gain more from other word classing schemes which are better tuned to the PP-attachment problem.
