These models are roughly clustered into two groups $$$$$ Most current SMT systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003) use a generative model for word alignment such as the freely available GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), an implementation of the IBM alignment models (Brown et al., 1993).
These models are roughly clustered into two groups $$$$$ Recently, a number of discriminative word alignment models have been proposed, however these early models are typically very complicated with many proposing intractable problems which require heuristics for approximate inference (Liu et al., 2005; Moore, 2005).

Such approaches have been shown to be effective in log-linear word alignment models where only a small supervised corpus is available (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006). $$$$$ We use a Conditional Random Field (CRF), a discriminative model, which is estimated on a small supervised training set.
Such approaches have been shown to be effective in log-linear word alignment models where only a small supervised corpus is available (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006). $$$$$ These models allow for the use of arbitrary and overlapping features over the source and target sentences, making the most of small supervised training sets.

The one most similar to ours is the one presented by Blunsom and Cohn (2006). $$$$$ The results presented in this paper were evaluated in terms of AER.

Labeled alignments are also used by Blunsom and Cohn (2006) to train a CRF word alignment model. $$$$$ We use a CRF to model many-to-one word alignments, where each source word is aligned with zero or one target words, and therefore each target word can be aligned with many source words.

The model is similar to the discriminative CRF-based word alignment model of (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006). $$$$$ This paper presents an alternative discriminative method for word alignment.

The model is trained by gradient ascent using the l-BFGS method (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), which has been successfully used for training log linear models (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006) in many natural language tasks, including alignment. $$$$$ We use L-BFGS, an iterative quasi-Newton optimisation method, which performs well for training log-linear models (Malouf, 2002; Sha and Pereira, 2003).
