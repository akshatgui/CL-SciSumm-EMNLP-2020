It is based on the transition-based dependency parsing paradigm (Nivre, 2008). $$$$$ Of the algorithms described in this article, the arc-eager stack-based algorithm is essentially the algorithm proposed for unlabeled dependency parsing in Nivre (2003), extended to labeled dependency parsing in Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004), and most fully described in Nivre (2006b).

If we consider transition-based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2008), the purely bottom-up strategy is implemented by the arc-standard model of Nivre (2004). $$$$$ The approach was extended to labeled dependency parsing by Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004) (for Swedish) and Nivre and Scholz (2004) (for English), using a different parsing algorithm first presented in Nivre (2003).

The above work on transition-based parsing has focused on greedy algorithms set in a statistical framework (Nivre, 2008). $$$$$ In this article, we have introduced a formal framework for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, where parsing algorithms can be defined in terms of transition systems that are deterministic only together with an oracle for predicting the next transition.

Quite impressively, models based on deterministic shift-reduce parsing algorithms are able to rival the other computationally more expensive models (see Nivre (2008) and references therein for more details). $$$$$ Although different types of parsing algorithms, feature models, and classifiers have been used for deterministic dependency parsing, there are very few studies that compare the impact of different components.

Nivre (2008) reports experiments on Arabic parsing using his MaltParser (Nivre et al, 2007), trained on the PADT. $$$$$ Altogether it has now been applied to 19 different languages (Nivre et al. 2006, 2007; Hall et al.
Nivre (2008) reports experiments on Arabic parsing using his MaltParser (Nivre et al, 2007), trained on the PADT. $$$$$ On the whole, however, the four algorithms investigated in this article give very similar performance both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and several previous studies have shown that both the stack-based and the list-based algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy together with properly trained classifiers (Nivre et al. 2006; Nivre 2007; Hall et al.

Nivre (2008) reports that non-projective and pseudo projective algorithms outperform the eager projective algorithm in MaltParser, but our training data did not contain any non-projective dependencies. $$$$$ Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm.

The Nivre standard algorithm is also reported to do better on Arabic, but in a preliminary experimentation, it did similarly or slightly worse than the eager one, perhaps due to high percentage of right branching (left headed structures) in our Arabic training set, an observation already noted in Nivre (2008). $$$$$ In order for this to be the case, there must first of all be a significant proportion of left-headed structures in the data.

Following Nivre (2008), we define a transition system for dependency parsing as a quadruple S= (C, T, cs, Ct), where 1. C is a set of configurations, 2. T is a set of transitions, each of which is a (partial) function t : C → C, 3. cs is an initialization function, mapping a sentence x to a configuration c ∈ C, 4. Ct ⊆ C is a set of terminal configurations. $$$$$ Let S = (C, T, cs, Ct) be a transition system for dependency parsing.
