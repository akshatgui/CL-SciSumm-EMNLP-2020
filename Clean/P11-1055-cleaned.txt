Distant supervision is provided by the following constraint $$$$$ Given the set of matches, define Σ to be set of NY Times sentences with two matched phrases, E to be the set of Freebase entities which were mentioned in one or more sentences, Δ to be the set of Freebase facts whose arguments, e1 and e2 were mentioned in a sentence in Σ, and R to be set of relations names used in the facts of Δ.
Distant supervision is provided by the following constraint $$$$$ We use the set of sentence-level features described by Riedel et al. (2010), which were originally developed by Mintz et al.

We then extract relation instances from each parse and apply the greedy inference algorithm from Hoffmann et al, (2011) to identify the best set of parses that satisfy the distant supervision constraint. $$$$$ We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Freebase.

Our work is closest to Hoffmann et al 2011). They address the same problem we do (binary relation extraction) with a MIML model, but they make two approximations. $$$$$ In general, the corpuslevel extraction problem is easier, since it need only make aggregate predictions, perhaps using corpuswide statistics.
Our work is closest to Hoffmann et al 2011). They address the same problem we do (binary relation extraction) with a MIML model, but they make two approximations. $$$$$ However, unlike the previous work, we did not make use of any features that explicitly aggregate these properties across multiple mention instances.

However, our implementation has several advantages over the original model $$$$$ A relation mention is a sequence of text (including one or more entity mentions) which states that some ground fact r(e) is true.
However, our implementation has several advantages over the original model $$$$$ While the Riedel et al. approach does include a model of which sentences express relations, it makes significant use of aggregate features that are primarily designed to do entity-level relation predictions and has a less detailed model of extractions at the individual sentence level.

We applied our method to Wikipedia articles using Freebase as a knowledge base and found that (i) our model identified patterns expressing a given relation more accurately than baseline methods and (ii) our method led to better extraction performance than the original DS (Mintz et al, 2009) and MultiR (Hoffmann et al., 2011), which is a state-of-the-art multi instance learning system for relation extraction (see Section 7). $$$$$ While weak supervision works well when the textual corpus is tightly aligned to the database contents (e.g., matching Wikipedia infoboxes to associated articles (Hoffmann et al., 2010)), Riedel et al. (2010) observe that the heuristic leads to noisy data and poor extraction performance when the method is applied more broadly (e.g., matching Freebase records to NY Times articles).
