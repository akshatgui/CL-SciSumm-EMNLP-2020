We used the best-performing model that fuses HCRF-Coarse and the supervised model (McDonald et al2007) by interpolation. $$$$$ This is achieved by using k-best Viterbi techniques to return the k-best global labelings for each document label in line 3.

McDonald et al (2007) also dealt with sentiment analysis, via the global joint-structural approach. $$$$$ The simplest approach to fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis would be to create a separate system for each level of granularity.
McDonald et al (2007) also dealt with sentiment analysis, via the global joint-structural approach. $$$$$ In this domain, hard’s parsing (Taskar et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005), sentiment can only be determined in context (i.e., machine translation (Liang et al., 2006) and summahard to assemble versus a hard workout).

More recently, McDonald et al (2007) have investigated a model for jointly performing sentence and document-level sentiment analysis, allowing the relationship between the two tasks to be captured and exploited. $$$$$ Figure 1 presents a model for jointly classifying the sentiment of both the sentences and the document.
More recently, McDonald et al (2007) have investigated a model for jointly performing sentence and document-level sentiment analysis, allowing the relationship between the two tasks to be captured and exploited. $$$$$ Sentence level analysis is dependent on neighbouring sentences as well as the paragraph level analysis, and the paragraph analysis is dependent on each of the sentences within it, the neighbouring paragraphs, and the document level analysis.

The data used in our initial English-only experiments were a set of 554 consumer reviews described in (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ Of the original 600 reviews that were gathered, we discarded duplicate reviews, reviews with insufficient text, and spam.

Finally, solutions that attempt to handle the error propagation problem have done so by explicitly optimizing for the best combination of document and sentence-level classification accuracy (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ Furthermore, these systems have tackled the problem at different levels of granularity, from the document level (Pang et al., 2002), sentence level (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mao and Lebanon, 2006), phrase level (Turney, 2002; Choi et al., 2005), as well as the speaker level in debates (Thomas et al., 2006).

Alternative approaches include explicitly ac counting for this structure by treating subjective sentence extraction as a sequence-labeling problem, such as in McDonald et al (2007). $$$$$ This includes parsing and relaanalysis to a sequential classification problem us- tion extraction (Miller et al., 2000), entity labeling ing constrained Viterbi inference.

McDonald et al (2007) propose a model which jointly identifies global polarity as well as paragraph and sentence-level polarity, all of which are observed in training data. $$$$$ Only features observed in the training data were considered.

While our approach uses a similar hierarchy, McDonald et al (2007) is concerned with recovering the labels at all levels, whereas in this work we are interested in using latent document content structure as a means to benefit task predictions. $$$$$ For example, longer documents might benefit from an analysis on the paragraph level as well as the sentence and document levels.

Subsequently, many other studies make efforts to improve the performance of machine learning-based classifiers by various means, such as using subjectivity summarization (Pang and Lee, 2004), seeking new superior textual features (Riloff et al, 2006), and employing document subcomponent information (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ Furthermore, these systems have tackled the problem at different levels of granularity, from the document level (Pang et al., 2002), sentence level (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mao and Lebanon, 2006), phrase level (Turney, 2002; Choi et al., 2005), as well as the speaker level in debates (Thomas et al., 2006).

NGram Back-off Features: Similar to McDonald et al (2007), we utilize backed-off versions of lexical bi grams and trigrams, where all possible combinations of the words in the ngram are replaced by their POS tags, creating features such as w j POS k, POS j w k, POS j POS k for each lexical bigram and similarly for trigrams. $$$$$ For example, if the sentence label set is Y(s) = {subj, obj} and the document set is Y(d) = {pos, neg}, then the system might contain the following feature, { 1 if p E P(si) and y!

 $$$$$ The local dependencies between sentiment labels on sentences is similar to the work of Pang and Lee (2004) where soft local consistency constraints were created between every sentence in a document and inference was solved using a min-cut algorithm.
 $$$$$ Furthermore, extensions to the sentence-document model were discussed and it was argued that a nested hierarchical structure would be beneficial since it would allow for efficient inference algorithms.

Moreover, the assigned tag applies to the whole blog post while a finer grained sentiment extraction is needed (McDonald et al, 2007). $$$$$ Previous work on sentiment analysis has covered a wide range of tasks, including polarity classification (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), opinion extraction (Pang and Lee, 2004), and opinion source assignment (Choi et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006).

But even in such approaches, McDonald et al (2007) note that information about the overall sentiment orientation of a document facilitates more accurate extraction of more specific information from the text. $$$$$ Extracting sentiment from text is a challenging problem with applications throughout Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.

Quantitatively, subjective sentences in the product reviews amount to 78% (McDonald et al, 2007), while subjective sentences in the movie review dataset are only about 25% (Mao and Lebanon, 2006). $$$$$ Furthermore, these systems have tackled the problem at different levels of granularity, from the document level (Pang et al., 2002), sentence level (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mao and Lebanon, 2006), phrase level (Turney, 2002; Choi et al., 2005), as well as the speaker level in debates (Thomas et al., 2006).
