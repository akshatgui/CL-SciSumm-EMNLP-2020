More independent of this approach are suggestions made by Moens and Steedmalt (1988) and by Webber (1988). $$$$$ (These Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 67 Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor cover similar phenomena to the macromoves described in Nakhimovsky, also this volume.)
More independent of this approach are suggestions made by Moens and Steedmalt (1988) and by Webber (1988). $$$$$ One way in English is via a perfect-tensed clause, which Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 69 Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor explicitly evokes another event, temporally earlier than the one currently in focus.

We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988). $$$$$ Over the discourse segment, other discourse entities in the segment's focus space may in turn become DF.
We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988). $$$$$ To hint again at what is to come: in Section 3.2, I will propose a temporal analogue of DF, which I have called temporal focus (TF).

However, previous research has found that demonstrative anaphors rarely refer to NPs, while it rarely refers to discourse segments (Webber (1988a)). $$$$$ With respect to definite pronouns and NPs, this will essentially be a review of previous research.

Webber (Webber, 1988) improved upon the above work by specifying rules for how events are related to one another in a discourse and Sing and Sing defined semantic constraints through which events can be related (Sing, 1997). $$$$$ The driver stopped the bus when the passengers began to sing &quot;Aida&quot;.
