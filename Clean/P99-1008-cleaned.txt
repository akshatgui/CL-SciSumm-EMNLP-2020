Berland and Charniak (1999) use Hearst style techniques to learn meronym relation ships (part-whole) from corpora. $$$$$ Indeed, in [2] Hearst states that she tried to apply this strategy to the part-of relation, but failed.

(Berland and Charniak, 1999) proposed similar lexico-syntactic patterns to extract part-whole relationships. $$$$$ In that paper Hearst (a) finds lexical correlates to the hyponym relations by looking in text for cases where known hyponyms appear in proximity (e.g., in the construction (NP, NP and (NP other NN)) as in &quot;boats, cars, and other vehicles&quot;), (b) tests the proposed patterns for validity, and (c) uses them to extract relations from a corpus.

The OtherY-Model performs particularly poorly on smaller data sizes, where coverage of the Hearst-style patterns maybe limited, as also observed by Berland and Charniak (1999). $$$$$ And although WordNet is hand-built, there is general agreement that corpus-based methods have an advantage in the relative completeness of their coverage, particularly when used as supplements to the more laborintensive methods.

Lexical patterns have been successfully used to represent various semantic relations between words such as hypernymy (Hearst, 1992), and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999). $$$$$ Following Hearst [2], we find possible patterns by taking two words that are in a part-whole relation (e.g, basement and building) and finding sentences in our corpus (we used the North American News Corpus (NANC) from LDC) that have these words within close proximity.
Lexical patterns have been successfully used to represent various semantic relations between words such as hypernymy (Hearst, 1992), and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999). $$$$$ Metrics of the form p(w I p) have the desirable property that they are invariant over p with radically different base frequencies, and for this reason have been widely used in corpus-based lexical semantic research [3,6,9].

Berland and Charniak (1999) suggest their work may be useful for building a lexicon or ontology, like WordNet. $$$$$ The part list could be scanned by an end-user and added to an existing ontology (such as WordNet), or used as a part of a rough semantic lexicon.

In attribute extraction, typically one must choose between the precise results of rich patterns (involving punctuation and parts-of-speech) applied to small corpora (Berland and Charniak, 1999) and the high-coverage results of superficial patterns applied to web-scale data, e.g. via the Google API (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004). $$$$$ Table 2 shows patterns A and B clearly outperform patterns C, D, and E.

Indeed, Berland and Charniak (1999) attempted to filter out attributes that were regarded as qualities (like drive ability) rather than parts (like steering wheels) by removing words ending with the suffixes -ness, -ing, and -ity. $$$$$ The second filters out all words ending with &quot;ing&quot;, &quot;ness&quot;, or &quot;ity&quot;, since these suffixes typically occur in words that denote a quality rather than a physical object.
