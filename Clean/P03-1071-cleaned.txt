The gold standard for thematic segmentations has been kindly provided by (Galley et al., 2003) and has been chosen by considering the agreement between at least three human annotations. $$$$$ We have evaluated our segmenter on the ICSI Meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003).

We evaluated WLM's performance on the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al 2003) by comparing our segmentation results to the results obtained by implementing LCSeg (Galley et al, 2003). $$$$$ We have evaluated our segmenter on the ICSI Meeting corpus (Janin et al., 2003).
We evaluated WLM's performance on the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al 2003) by comparing our segmentation results to the results obtained by implementing LCSeg (Galley et al, 2003). $$$$$ In the case of the Meeting corpus, none of the algorithms are significantly different than the others, due to the the table are the results of significance tests between U00 and LCseg.

For example, lexical cohesion-based algorithms, such as LCSEG (Galley et al, 2003), or its word frequency-based predecessor TextTile (Hearst, 1997) capture topic shifts by modeling the similarity of word repetition in adjacent windows. $$$$$ Embodiments of this idea include semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), cosine similarity in word vector space (Hearst, 1994), inter-sentence similarity matrix (Reynar, 1994; Choi, 2000), entity repetition (Kan et al., 1998), word frequency models (Reynar, 1999), or adaptive language models (Beeferman et al., 1999).

Previous work has shown that training a segmentation model with features that are extracted from knowledge sources other than words, such as speaker interaction (e.g., overlap rate, pause, and speaker change) (Galley et al, 2003), or participant behaviors, e.g., note taking cues (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2006), can outperform LCSEG on similar tasks. $$$$$ We tried to restrict ourselves to features whose inclusion is motivated by previous work (pauses, speech rate) and added features that are specific to multi-speaker speech (overlap, changes in speaker activity).

Adapting the standard definition of topic (Galley et al, 2003) to conversations/emails, we consider a topic is something about which the participant(s) discuss or argue or express their opinions. $$$$$ In work on segmentation of spoken documents, intonational, prosodic, and acoustic indicators are used to detect topic boundaries (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1998; Beeferman et al., 1999; T¨ur et al., 2001).

The so-labeled G03* algorithm indicates the error rates obtained by (Galley et al, 2003) when extra (meeting specific) features have been adopted in a decision tree classifier. $$$$$ A significant error reduction is obtained by combining the two knowledge sources.
