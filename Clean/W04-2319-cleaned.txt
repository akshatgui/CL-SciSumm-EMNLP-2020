Following the work of Shriberg et al (2004), we use the 5 general tags in our experiments: Disruption indicates the current Dialogue Act is interrupted. $$$$$ The MRDA system requires one “general tag” per DA, and attaches a variable number of following “specific tags”.
Following the work of Shriberg et al (2004), we use the 5 general tags in our experiments: Disruption indicates the current Dialogue Act is interrupted. $$$$$ If instead we look at only the 11 obligatory general tags, for which there is one per DA, and if we split labels at the pipe bar, the total is 113,560 (excluding tags that only include a disruption label).

Like the Switchboard corpus, the ICSI Meeting Room DA (MRDA) corpus (Shriberg et al, 2004) was annotated using a variant of the DAMSL tag set, similar but not identical to the Switchboard DAMSL annotation. $$$$$ The ICSI Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA) Corpus

The differences (and a translation between the two sets) can be seen in Shriberg et al (2004). $$$$$ We found that SWBD-DAMSL [11], a system adapted from DAMSL [6], provided a fairly good fit.

All of them have been transcribed and annotated with dialog acts (DA) (Shriberg et al, 2004), topics, and abstractive and extractive summaries in the AMI project (Murray et al, 2005). $$$$$ We describe a new corpus of hand-annotated dialog acts and adjacency pairs for roughly 72 hours of naturally occurring multi-party meetings.

While there are related tags for dialogue act tagging schema? like DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997), which includes tags such as Action-Directive and Commit, and the ICSI MRDA schema (Shriberg et al, 2004) which includes a committag these classes are too general to allow identification of action items specifically. $$$$$ The ordering of tags in the table is explained as follows: In the mapping of DAMSL tags to SWBD-DAMSL tags in the SWBDDAMSL manual, tags were ordered in categories such as “Communication Status”, “Information Requests”, and so on.

All the meetings have been transcribed and annotated with dialog acts (DA) (Shriberg et al, 2004), topics, and extractive summaries (Murray et al, 2005). $$$$$ In addition, meetings that occur naturally involve real topics, debates, issues, and social dynamics that should generalize more readily to other real meetings than might data collected using artificial scenarios.
