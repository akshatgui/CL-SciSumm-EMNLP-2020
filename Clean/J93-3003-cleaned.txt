Empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which a discourse marker occurs, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse usages in about 80% of cases. $$$$$ Empirical Studies On The Disambiguation Of Cue Phrases
Empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which a discourse marker occurs, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse usages in about 80% of cases. $$$$$ Our model is based on several empirical studies (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990): two studies of individual cue phrases in which we develop our model, and a more comprehensive study of cue phrases as a class, in which we confirm and expand our model.

We extract the initial unigram, bigram, and trigram of each utterance as discourse features (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Schiffrin (1987) also assumes that discourse uses of cue phrases are utterance initial.

In the literature, there is still no consistent definition for discourse markers (Hirschberg and Litman 1993). $$$$$ Cue phrases, words and phrases that directly signal the structure of a discourse, have been variously termed clue words, discourse markers, discourse connectives, and discourse particles in the computational linguistic and conversational analysis literature.

This is due to the fact that, similar to the question of cue phrase polysemy (Hirschberg and Litman 1993), many Chinese discourse markers have both discourse senses and alternate sentential senses in different utterances. $$$$$ In particular, the question of cue phrase polysemy has yet to receive a satisfactory solution.
This is due to the fact that, similar to the question of cue phrase polysemy (Hirschberg and Litman 1993), many Chinese discourse markers have both discourse senses and alternate sentential senses in different utterances. $$$$$ Each lexical item that has one or more discourse senses also has one or more alternate, sentential senses, which make a semantic contribution to the interpretation of an utterance.

Annotation includes two stages: first, we allowed two coders to choose 'explanation' relations signaled by because using (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993)'s 3-way classification. $$$$$ This allowed us to study how adjacent cue phrases interact Julia Hirschberg and Diane Litman Disambiguation of Cue Phrases with one another.
Annotation includes two stages: first, we allowed two coders to choose 'explanation' relations signaled by because using (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993)'s 3-way classification. $$$$$ We hypothesize, then, that, while individual speakers may choose different strategies to realize discourse now, they appear to choose from among the same limited number of options.

Many discourse segmentation techniques (e.g. Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) as well as some topic segmentation algorithms rely on cue words and phrases. $$$$$ Without such discourse segmentation, the incorrect potential antecedents might have been preferred, given their surface proximity and number agreement with the pronoun in question.

 $$$$$ Another intonational feature that is considered in our study of cue phrases is prosodic phrasing.

We use a list of cue phrases identified by Hirschberg and Litman (1993). $$$$$ Based on the findings of our study of now, we proposed that listeners may use prosodic information to disambiguate discourse from sentential uses of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1987).

Perhaps the most studied cue for discourse structure are lexical cues, also called cue phrases, which are defined as follows by Hirschberg and Litman (1993). $$$$$ However, while cue phrases may convey discourse structure, each also one or more alternate uses.

For example Hirschberg and Litman (1993) found that into national phrasing and pitch accent play a role in disambiguating cue phrases, and hence in helping determine discourse structure. $$$$$ The critical role that cue phrases play in understanding and generating discourse has often been noted in the computational linguistics literature.
For example Hirschberg and Litman (1993) found that into national phrasing and pitch accent play a role in disambiguating cue phrases, and hence in helping determine discourse structure. $$$$$ We will have more to say on the role of orthography in disambiguating cue phrases in connection with the study described in Section 5.

our own implementation of a feature concerning the presence of certain cue words (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993). $$$$$ Another intonational feature that is considered in our study of cue phrases is prosodic phrasing.
