Some text planners take as their goal the delivery of a single fact, or a set of facts, but take into account that other information may need to be given first for each message to be understood, other information may need to be given after to counter misconceptions, and examples may be given to aide assimilation (for in stance, the RST text planners, such as Hovy 1988). $$$$$ The structurer produces all coherent paragraphs (that is, coherent as defined by the relations) that satisfy the given goal(s) for any set of input elements.

This approach is adopted from text generation where plan-operators are responsible for choosing linguistic means in order to create coherent stretches of text (see, for instance, (Moore and Paris, 1989) and (Hovy, 1988)). $$$$$ Planning Coherent Multisentential Text
This approach is adopted from text generation where plan-operators are responsible for choosing linguistic means in order to create coherent stretches of text (see, for instance, (Moore and Paris, 1989) and (Hovy, 1988)). $$$$$ Text structuring is one of a number of pre-generation text planning tasks.

As for any generated text, a good summary also requires a text plan (Hovy, 1988) (McKeown, 1985). $$$$$ In her thesis work, McKeown took a different approach ([McKeown 82]).
As for any generated text, a good summary also requires a text plan (Hovy, 1988) (McKeown, 1985). $$$$$ Hovy ([llovy 86]) describes a program that uses some relations to slant text.
