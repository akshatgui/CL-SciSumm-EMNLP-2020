Recently, the integration of NLP systems with manually-built resources at the predicate argument-level, such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) has received growing interest. $$$$$ The FrameNet work is in some ways similar to efforts to describe the argument structures of lexical items in terms of case-roles or thetaroles,5 but in FrameNet, the role names (called frame elements or FEs) are local to particular conceptual structures (frames); some of these are quite general, while others are specific to a small family of lexical items.

In formalisms such as Frame Semantics (Baker et al, 1998), semantic roles generalize across semantically similar predicates belonging to the same frame. $$$$$ The project's key features are (a) a commitment to corpus evidence for semantic and syntactic generalizations, and (b) the representation of the valences of its target words (mostly nouns, adjectives, and verbs) in which the semantic portion makes use of frame semantics.

Driven by annotation resources such as FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005), many systems developed in these studies have achieved argument F1 scores near 80% in large-scale evaluations such as the one reported by Carreras and Marquez (2005). $$$$$ This selection of examples is achieved through a hybrid process partially controlled by the preliminary lexical description of each lemma.
