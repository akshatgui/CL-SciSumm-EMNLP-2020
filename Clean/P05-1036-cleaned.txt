Recently Turner and Charniak (2005) presented supervised and semi-supervised versions of the Knight and Marcu noisy-channel model. $$$$$ This supervised version compresses better than either version of the supervised noisy-channel model that lacks these rules.

We also exploited more general tree productions known as synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) rules, in an approach quite similar to (Turner and Charniak, 2005). $$$$$ We count all probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) expansions, and then match up similar rules as unsupervised joint events.

Alternatively, the rules of compression are approximated from a non-parallel corpus (e.g., the Penn Treebank) by considering context-free grammar derivations with matching expansions (Turner and Charniak 2005). $$$$$ We create joint rules using only the first section (0.mrg) of the Penn Treebank.

Although both models yield comparable performance, Turner and Charniak (2005) show that the latter is not an appropriate compression model since it favours uncompressed sentences over compressed ones. $$$$$ One of the biggest problems with this model of sentence compression is the lack of appropriate training data.

 $$$$$ There are several hundred rules of this type, and it is very simple to incorporate into our model.

Turner and Charniak (2005) argue that the noisy-channel model is not an appropriate compression model since it uses a source model trained on uncompressed sentences and as a result tends to consider compressed sentences less likely than uncompressed ones. $$$$$ The K&M model uses parse trees for the sentences.

Turner and Charniak (2005) have shown that applying handcrafted rules for trimming sentences can improve both content and linguistic quality. $$$$$ As will be shown, this rule is not constraining enough and allows some poor compressions, but it is remarkable that any sort of compression can be achieved without training data.

While data sparsity is a common problem of many NLP tasks, it is much more severe for sentence compression, leading Turner and Charniak (2005) to question the applicability of the channel model for this task altogether. $$$$$ The K&M probabilistic model, adapted from machine translation to this task, is the noisy-channel model.

See (Turner and Charniak, 2005) for a discussion of problems that can occur for text compression when using a language model trained on data from the uncompressed side. $$$$$ The main difference between their model and ours is that instead of using the rather ad-hoc K&M language model, we substitute the syntax-based language model described in (Charniak, 2001).
