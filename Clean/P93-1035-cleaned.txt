Second, there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text, a recent example being Brill 1993. $$$$$ In (BM92a), distributional analysis techniques are applied to a large corpus to learn a context-free grammar.
Second, there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text, a recent example being Brill 1993. $$$$$ In this paper, we have described a new approach for learning a grammar to automatically parse text.

Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993), or work with artificial samples (Elman, 1990). $$$$$ While the numbers presented above allow us to compare the transformation learner with systems trained and tested on comparable corpora, these results are all based upon the assumption that the test data is tagged fairly reliably (manually tagged text was used in all of these experiments, as well in the experiments of (PS92, SR093).)

This idea is not new, but as far as we know it has been implemented in rule-based taggers and parsers, such as (Brill, 1993a), (Brill, 1993b), (Brill, 1993c) and (Ribarov, 1996), but not in models based on probability distributions. $$$$$ TRANSFORMATION-BASED

 $$$$$ 4The twelve transformations can be decomposed into two structural transformations, that shown here and its converse, along with six triggering environments.
 $$$$$ We hope these future paths will lead to a trainable and very accurate parser for free text.
