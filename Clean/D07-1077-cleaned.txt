We argue that even though the rules by Wang et al (2007) exist, it is almost impossible to automatically convert their rules into rules that are applicable to dependency parsers. $$$$$ Hence we only developed reordering rules to handle DNP and clausal (CP) modifiers.

The training data, which included those data used in Wang et al (2007), contained 1 million pairs of sentences extracted from the Linguistic Data Consortium's parallel news corpora. $$$$$ The reordering process is used to prepro cess both the training and test data used within an existing SMT system.

(Wang et al, 2007) uses rules very similar to our own as they use the same language pair, although they reorder the Chinese, whereas we reorder the English. $$$$$ Itis worth noting that none of these approaches to re ordering make use of explicit syntactic information in the source language?for example, none of the methods make use of an existing source-language parser (the systems of Yamada and Knight (2001) and Marcu et al (2006) make use of a parser in the target language, i.e., English).
