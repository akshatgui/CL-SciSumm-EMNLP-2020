The evaluation in this paper was based solely on CCGbank, but we have shown in Clark and Curran (2007) that the CCG parser gives state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the RASP parser (Briscoe et al, 2006) by over 5% on DepBank. $$$$$ In this paper we evaluate a CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2004b) on the Briscoe and Carroll version of DepBank (Briscoe and Carroll, 2006).

CCG and HPSG parsers also favor the dependency based metrics for evaluation (Clark and Curran, 2007b; Miyao and Tsujii, 2008). $$$$$ The most common form of parser evaluation is to apply the Parseval metrics to phrase-structure parsers based on the Penn Treebank, and the highest reported scores are now over 90% (Bod, 2003; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).

For example, Clark and Curran (2007) developed a set of mapping rules from the output of a Combinatorial Categorial grammar parser to the Grammatical Relations (GR) (Carroll et al, 1998). $$$$$ Parsers have been developed for a variety of grammar formalisms, for example HPSG (Toutanova et al., 2002; Malouf and van Noord, 2004), LFG (Kaplan et al., 2004; Cahill et al., 2004), TAG (Sarkar and Joshi, 2003), CCG (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004b), and variants of phrase-structure grammar (Briscoe et al., 2006), including the phrase-structure grammar implicit in the Penn Treebank (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 2000).

However, cross framework parser evaluation is a difficult problem $$$$$ Comparison with Penn Treebank parsers would be difficult because, for many constructions, the Penn Treebank trees and CCG derivations are different shapes, and reversing the mapping Hockenmaier used to create CCGbank would be very difficult.

Clark and Curran (2007a) demonstrate the use of techniques like adaptive super tagging, parallelisation and a dynamic-programming chart parsing algorithm to implement the C & C parser, a highly efficient CCG parser that performs well against parsers built on different formalisms (Rimell et al, 2009). $$$$$ A key question facing the parsing community is how to compare parsers which use different grammar formalisms and produce different output.

We find that, not only can we produce models that are suitable for kick-starting the treebanking process, but the accuracy of these models is comparable to parsers trained on gold standard data (Clark and Curran, 2007b; Miyao and Tsujii,2008), which have been successfully used in applications (Miyao et al, 2008). $$$$$ (1998) gold-standard.

The CCG super tagger is not able to assign a single category to each word with extremely high accuracy - hence the need for it to operate as a multi-tagger - but even in multi-tagger mode it dramatically reduces the ambiguity passed through to the parser (Clark and Curran, 2007b). $$$$$ Thus all that is required to use such a scheme, in theory, is that the parser being evaluated is able to identify heads.
