Possible strategies for treating sentence-level anaphora within the centering framework are processing sentences linearly one clause at a time (as suggested by Grosz et al (1995)). $$$$$ However, the lack of complete information at the time of processing an utterance means that a unique interpretation cannot be definitely determined.

To summarize the results of our empirical evaluation, we claim that our proposal based on functional criteria leads to substantively better results for languages with free word order than the linear approach suggested by Grosz et al (1995) and the two approaches which prefer inter-sentential or intra-sentential ntecedents. $$$$$ Although several cross-linguistic studies have investigated Rule 2 (see Section 9), there are as yet no psycholinguistic results empirically validating it.

Crucial for the evaluation of the centering model (Grosz et al, 1995) and its applicability to naturally occurring discourse is the lack of a specification concerning how to handle complex sentences and internal sentential anaphora. $$$$$ Frequent shifting leads to a lack of local coherence, as was illustrated by the contrast between Discourse (1) and Discourse (2) in Section 2.

Linguists have also studied various aspects of text flow like the centering theory (Grosz et al, 1995) among the most influential contributions. $$$$$ There are several alternative explanations of such examples, involving various accounts of speaker's intentions, mutual belief, and the like.

Most models attempting to capture local coherence between sentences were based on or inspired by centering theory (Grosz et al, 1995), which postulated strong links between the center of attention in comprehension of adjacent sentences and syntactic position and form of reference. $$$$$ Centering: A Framework For Modeling The Local Coherence Of Discourse

Finally, Poesio examined the hypothesis that finding the anchor of a BD involves knowing which entities are the CB and the CP in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ It is commonly accepted, and is a hypothesis under which our work on centering proceeds, that a hearer's determination of noun phrase reference involves some process of inference.

Centering Theory (CT) characterises the local coherence of a text on the basis of the discourse entities in a text and the way in which they are introduced (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ Centering: A Framework For Modeling The Local Coherence Of Discourse
Centering Theory (CT) characterises the local coherence of a text on the basis of the discourse entities in a text and the way in which they are introduced (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ These entities may either have been explicitly introduced into the discourse or sufficiently closely related to such entities to be considered implicitly in focus (Grosz 1981).

Centering Theory (CT, Grosz et al 1995) is an entity-based theory of local coherence, which claims that certain entities mentioned in an utterance are more central than others and that this property constrains a speaker's use of certain referring expressions. $$$$$ The paper examines interactions between local coherence and choice of referring expressions; it argues that differences in coherence correspond in part to the inference demands made by different types of referring expressions, given a particular attentional state.

Centering Theory (Grosz et al, 1995) has been an influential framework for modelling entity coherence in computational linguistics in the last two decades. $$$$$ Centering: A Framework For Modeling The Local Coherence Of Discourse
Centering Theory (Grosz et al, 1995) has been an influential framework for modelling entity coherence in computational linguistics in the last two decades. $$$$$ In Section 4, we state the main properties of the centering framework and the major claims of centering theory.

Entity-based theories of discourse (e.g., (Grosz et al, 1995)) claim that a coherent text segment tends to focus on a specific entity. $$$$$ In a locally coherent discourse segment, shifts are followed by a sequence of continuations characterizing another stretch of locally coherent discourse.
Entity-based theories of discourse (e.g., (Grosz et al, 1995)) claim that a coherent text segment tends to focus on a specific entity. $$$$$ The difference between these two theories can be seen from the following example (from Sidner [19791): On Sidner's account, Carl is the actor focus after (34b) and Jeff is the discourse focus.

Summarised below are some issues specific to anaphora resolution in spoken dialogues (see also Byron and Stent (1998) who mention some of these problems in their account of the Centering model (Grosz et al, 1995)). $$$$$ We describe how the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.

Byron and Stent (1998) present extensions of the centering model (Grosz et al, 1995) for spoken dialogue and identify several problems with the model. $$$$$ Centering was proposed as a model that accounted for this phenomenon.

The main new aspect of the markup scheme, especially as far as our studies of salience were concerned, are the elements used to annotate potential utterance sin the sense of Centering (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ In Section 4, we state the main properties of the centering framework and the major claims of centering theory.
The main new aspect of the markup scheme, especially as far as our studies of salience were concerned, are the elements used to annotate potential utterance sin the sense of Centering (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ The type of example Sidner was concerned about would occur if utterance (34c) were replaced by &quot;He thinks he studies too much.&quot; However, the centering rules would still hold in this case.

Our model is inspired by Centering (Grosz et al, 1995) and other entity-based models of coherence (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) in which an entity is in focus through a sequence of sentences. $$$$$ Attentional state models the discourse participants' focus of attention at any given point in the discourse.
Our model is inspired by Centering (Grosz et al, 1995) and other entity-based models of coherence (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) in which an entity is in focus through a sequence of sentences. $$$$$ For a sequence of utterances to be a discourse, it must exhibit coherence.

Grosz et al (1995) give the following example of the Am SHIFT pattern. $$$$$ In either case, in utterance (2c) John seems to be central, requiring a shift from utterance (2b), while the store becomes central again in utterance (2d), requiring yet another shift.
Grosz et al (1995) give the following example of the Am SHIFT pattern. $$$$$ For example, the second utterance in the following sequence prefers a VF interpretation but allows for the VL interpretation that is needed in the third utterance.

Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ In particular, this constraint stipulates that no element in an utterance can be realized as a pronoun unless the backward-looking center of the utterance is realized as a pronoun also.'
Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ A violation of Rule 1 occurs if a pronoun is not used for the backward-looking center and some other entity is realized by a pronoun.

pronouns involve local focusing while full lexical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ Grosz (1977) defined two levels of focusing in discourse: global and immediate.
pronouns involve local focusing while full lexical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al, 1995). $$$$$ In contrast, immediate focusing referred to a more local focusing process—one that relates to identifying the entity that an individual utterance most centrally concerns.
