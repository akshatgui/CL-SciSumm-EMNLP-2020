This was pursued further, for instance, by Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) and Wong and Mooney (2007), aimed at learning log-linear models, or (in the latter case) synchronous CF grammars augmented with lambda operators, for mapping English queries to DB queries. $$$$$ All English questions in this data set were manually translated into Spanish, Japanese and Turkish, while the corresponding Prolog queries remain unchanged.

They solved the problem of aligning sentences and meanings by iteratively retraining an existing supervised semantic parser, WASP (Wong and Mooney, 2007b) or KRISP (Kate and Mooney, 2006), or an existing supervised natural-language generator, WASP-1 (Wong and Mooney, 2007a). $$$$$ For some domains, this problem can be avoided by transforming a logical language into a variable-free, functional language (e.g. the GEOQUERY functional query language in Wong and Mooney (2006)).

Our approach outperforms the previous system WASP? 1++ (Wong and Mooney, 2007a) significantly, and achieves comparable or slightly better performance as compared to Lu et al (2009). $$$$$ First, we compared the performance of A-WASP with and without conjunct regrouping (Section 4).

We follow the standard evaluation procedure for Geo250, using 10-fold cross validation experiments with the same splits of the data as Wong and Mooney (2007). $$$$$ We performed a single run of 10-fold cross validation, and measured the performance of the learned parsers using precision (percentage of translations that were correct), recall (percentage of test sentences that were correctly translated), and Fmeasure (harmonic mean of precision and recall).

Wong and Mooney (2007) and Chen and Mooney (2008) use synchronous grammars that map a logical form, represented as a tree, into a parse of the text. $$$$$ This is the yield of the MR parse tree, since the root node of the parse tree is reached.
