Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ Before the central shift, the client had control for more turns per topic and after it, the expert had control for more turns per topic.

Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ 3.1 Prompts.
Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ Repetitions seem to work in a similar way: the fact that a speaker reiterates indicates that he has nothing more to say on a topic.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ Each of these rules related control to utterance type: (a) For questions, the speaker was defined as being in control unless the question directly followed a question or command by the other conversant.
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not. $$$$$ The reason for this is that questions uttered following questions or commands are normally attempts to clarify the preceding utterance and as such are elicited by the previous speaker's utterance rather than directing the conversation in their own right.

Initiative is held by the speaker who is driving the conversation at any given point in the conversation (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ (b) For assertions, the speaker was defined as being in control unless the assertion was made in response to a question, for the same reasons as those given for questions; an assertion which is a response to a question could not be said to be controlling the discourse; (c) For commands, the speaker was defined as controlling the conversation.
Initiative is held by the speaker who is driving the conversation at any given point in the conversation (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ As we might expect, the point at which the expert begins to have control over more turns per topic is also the point at which the expert begins to initiate new topics.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) looked at the correlation of control boundaries to discourse markers, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) looked at anaphoric reference. $$$$$ We also looked at when no signal was given (interruptions).

In our study, the first author coded initiative using the annotation scheme of Whittaker and Stenton (1988). $$$$$ This study therefore takes a different approach.
In our study, the first author coded initiative using the annotation scheme of Whittaker and Stenton (1988). $$$$$ Using this parameter we identified three levels of structure in the dialogues: (a) control phases; (b) topic; and (c) global organisation.

Whittaker and Stenton (1988) assigned initiative to the speaker of statements, except when it was the answer to a question, in which case it belonged to the speaker asking the question. $$$$$ Each of these rules related control to utterance type: (a) For questions, the speaker was defined as being in control unless the question directly followed a question or command by the other conversant.

Following Whittaker and Stenton (1988), we use utterance tags to determine whether an utterance shows initiative: forward functions show initiative while others do not. $$$$$ We devised several rules to determine the location of control in the dialogues.

After experimenting with several tagging methods, we concluded that the approach presented in Walker and Whittaker (1990) adopted from (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) best captured the aspects of the dialogue we were interested in and, as with the DAs, could be tagged reliably on our data. $$$$$ This study therefore takes a different approach.

Constructs such as Initiative and Control (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988), which attempt to operationalize the authority over a discourse's structure, fall under the umbrella of positioning. $$$$$ We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between control and discourse structure.
Constructs such as Initiative and Control (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988), which attempt to operationalize the authority over a discourse's structure, fall under the umbrella of positioning. $$$$$ We applied control criteria to four dialogues and identified 3 levels of discourse structure.

A speaker who begins a discourse segment is said to have initiative, while control accounts for which speaker is being addressed in a dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). $$$$$ We applied the control rules and found that control did not alternate from speaker to speaker on a turn by turn basis, but that there were long sequences of turns in which control remained with one speaker.
