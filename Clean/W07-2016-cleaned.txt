We prefer SemCor to all-words datasets available in Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) or SemEval-2007 (Pradhan et al, 2007), since it includes many more documents than either set (350 versus 3) and therefore allowing more reliable results. $$$$$ SemEval-2007 Task-17

The use of coarse-grained sense groups (Palmer et al, 2007) has led to considerable advances in WSD performance, with accuracies of around 90% (Pradhan et al, 2007). $$$$$ OntoNotes (Hovy et al, 2006) is a project that has annotated several layers of semantic information ? including word senses, at a high inter-annotator agreement of over 90%.

Given that the WSD literature has shown that all features, including local and syntactic features, are necessary for optimal performance (Pradhan et al, 2007), we propose the following alternative to construct the matrix. $$$$$ For the convenience of the partici pants who wanted to use syntactic parse information as features using an off-the-shelf syntactic parser, we decided to compose the training data of Sections 02-21.
