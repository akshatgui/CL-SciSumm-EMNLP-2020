Elastic nets interpolate between L1 and L2, having been proposed by Zou and Hastie (2005) and used by Lavergne et al (2010) to regularize CRFs. $$$$$ In the following, we will jointly use both penalty terms, yielding the socalled elastic net penalty (Zhou and Hastie, 2005) which corresponds to the objective function The use of both penalty terms makes it possible to control the number of non zero coefficients and to avoid the numerical problems that might occur in large dimensional parameter settings (see also (Chen, 2009)).

As our sequence labeling model we use the Wapiti implementation of Conditional Random Fields (Lavergne et al, 2010) with the L-BFGS optimizer and elastic net regularization with default settings. $$$$$ Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a widely-used approach for supervised sequence labelling, notably due to their ability to handle large description spaces and to integrate structural dependency between labels.
