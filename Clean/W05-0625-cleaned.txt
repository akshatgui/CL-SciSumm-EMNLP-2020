Its architecture is based on the top system in the 2005 CoNLL shared task (Koomen et al, 2005), modified to process raw text using lower level processors but maintaining 6 good real time performance. $$$$$ Significant improvement in overall SRL performance through this inference is illustrated.

Only recently we have been able to test Koomen et al (2005) SRL tool. $$$$$ Overall results on the development and test sets are shown in Table 1.

Combining the output from several different systems has been shown to be beneficial (Koomen et al, 2005). $$$$$ In fact, these two parsers have noticeably different output.

These were first annotated with semantic roles using a state of-the-art semantic role labeling system (Koomen et al, 2005). $$$$$ Generalized Inference With Multiple Semantic Role Labeling Systems

Koomen et al (2005) adopted the outputs of multiple SRL systems (each on a single parse tree) and combined them into a coherent predicate argument output by solving an optimization problem. $$$$$ The inference provides a natural way to take the output of multiple argument classifiers and combines them into a coherent predicate-argument output.
Koomen et al (2005) adopted the outputs of multiple SRL systems (each on a single parse tree) and combined them into a coherent predicate argument output by solving an optimization problem. $$$$$ The inference stage can take as its input the output of the argument classification of a single system or of multiple systems.

On the other hand, probabilistic inference processes, which have been successfully used for SRL (Koomen et al, 2005), mandate that each individual candidate argument be associated with its raw activation, or confidence, in the given model. $$$$$ For the systems that do not output for any candidate, we assign the probability with a prior to this phantom candidate.
