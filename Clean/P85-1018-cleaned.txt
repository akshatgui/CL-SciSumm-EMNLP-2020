Shieber (1985) proposes a more efficient approach to gaps in the PATR-II formalism, extending Earley's algorithm by using. $$$$$ In Section 4, we develop a correct, complete and terminating extension of Earley's algorithm for the PATR-II formalism using the restriction notion.
Shieber (1985) proposes a more efficient approach to gaps in the PATR-II formalism, extending Earley's algorithm by using. $$$$$ We now develop a concrete example of the use of restriction in parsing by extending Earley's algorithm to parse grammars in the PATR-II formalism just presented.

PATR-II (Shieber, 1985) into context-free grammars (CFG). $$$$$ We start with the Earley algorithm for context-free-based PATR-II on which the other algorithms are based.

The abstraction is specified by means of a restrict or (Shieber, 1985), the so-called lexicon restrict or. $$$$$ A dag with an empty domain is often called an empty dag or variable.

Pereira and Warren (1983) and Shieber (1985) present versions of Earley's algorithm for unification grammars, in which unification is the sole operation responsible for attribute valuation. $$$$$ The following examples illustrate the notion of unification

After establishing a correspondence b tween attribute and unification grammar (UG), we may see that the technique of 'restrictions'; used by Shieber (1985) in his extended algorithm is related to finite partitioning on attribute domains, in fact a particular case which takes advantage of the more structured attribute domains of UG. $$$$$ Still, the algorithm should take advantage of that part of the arbitrarily large amount of information in the complex-feature structures that is significant for guiding parsing with the particular grammar.

We can use the technique of restriction (Shieber 1985) to remove these features from our feature structures. $$$$$ The PATR-II nonterminal domain is a lattice of directed, acyclic, graph structures (dags).3 Dags can be thought of as similar to the reentrant f-structures of LFG or functional structures of FUG, and we will use the bracketed notation associated with these formalisms for them.
We can use the technique of restriction (Shieber 1985) to remove these features from our feature structures. $$$$$ This technique of restriction of complex-feature structures into a finite set of equivalence classes can be used for a wide variety of purposes.

[Shieber, 1985] therefore proposes a modified version of the Earley-parser, using restricted top down prediction. $$$$$ First, parsing algorithms such as the above can be modified for use by grammar formalisms other than PATR-II.
[Shieber, 1985] therefore proposes a modified version of the Earley-parser, using restricted top down prediction. $$$$$ For example. the ancillary rimrt ion to compfite 1.1t closure-- which, like the Earley algorithm. either does not use feature information, or fails to terminate—can be modified in the same way as the Earley predictor step to terminate while still using significant feature information.

 $$$$$ Instead, we would like a parsing algorithm that placed no restraints on the grammars it could handle as long as they could be expressed within the intended formalism.
 $$$$$ We feel that the restriction technique has great potential to make increasingly powerful grammar formalisms computationally feasible.

For UGs which lack a so-called context-free back-bone, such as CUG, the top-down prediction step can only be guaranteed to terminate if we make use of restriction, as defined in Shieber (1985). $$$$$ However, because there are a potentially infinite number of such feature structures, the prediction step may never terminate.
For UGs which lack a so-called context-free back-bone, such as CUG, the top-down prediction step can only be guaranteed to terminate if we make use of restriction, as defined in Shieber (1985). $$$$$ If the restrictor is chosen appropriately, this can be as constraining as predicting on the basis of the whole feature structure, yet prediction is guaranteed to terminate because the domain of restricted feature structures is finite.

The performance of the parsing algorithms discussed in the preceding sections (a bottom-up parser for UG (BU), a top-down parser for UG (of Shieber, 1985) (TD), a top-down parser operating on an instantiated grammar (TD/1), and a bottom-up parser with top down filtering operating on an instantiated grammar (BU/LC)) were tested on two experimental CUGs, one implementing the morphosyntactic features of German NPs, and one implementing the syntax of WH-questions in Dutch by means of a gap-threading mechanism. $$$$$ For example, if we find a verb that subcategorizes for a noun phrase, but the grammar rules allow postverbal NPs, PPs, s, VPs, and so forth, the parser will have no way to eliminate the building of edges corresponding to these categories.

Comparing our results with those of Shieber (1985) and Haas (1989), we see that in all cases top-down filtering may reduce the size of the chart significantly. $$$$$ In the cases where no unification exists, the unification is said to fail.

However, such an adaptation of CF algorithms involves their extension to possibly infinite nonterminal domains, which, as Shieber (1985) and Haas (1989) have shown, is nontrivial. $$$$$ In this paper, we discuss a solution to the problem of extending parsing algorithms to formalisms with possibly infinite nonterminal domains, a solution based on a general technique we call restriction.

Shieber (1985, 1992) follows established terminology in speaking of top-down filtering in connection with the prediction step of the Earley algorithm. $$$$$ Formally, we define restriction as follows.

We view the linking relation not simply as a filter to increase fficiency within the domain of syntactic analysis - this aspect is stressed by Shieber (1985) and other investigators such as Bouma (1991) - but rather as a device for the top-down predictive instantiation of information, as Shieber et al (1990) have shown for semantic-head-driven generation. $$$$$ Second. and perhaps more critically, because only certain of the information in a rule is used to guide the parse, say major category information, only such information can be used to filter spurious hypotheses by top-down filtering.
