Some of the work is not related to discourse at all (e.g., lexical similarities (Takamura et al, 2007), morphosyntactic similarities (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) and word-based measures like TF IDF (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006)). $$$$$ With the graph defined, there are several algorithms one can use to carry out semi-supervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Delalleau et al., 2005; Joachims, 2003; Blum and Chawla, 2001; Belkin et al., 2005).

Thus, instead of directly learning a classification function, we learn a regression function - similar to (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) - that is then used for ranking the hypotheses. $$$$$ Standard supervised machine learning algorithms cannot learn from unlabeled data.

To perform rating inference on reviews, Goldberg and Zhu (2006) created a graph on both labeled and unlabeled reviews, and then solved an optimization problem to obtain a smooth rating function over the whole graph. $$$$$ We then solve an optimization problem to obtain a smooth rating function over the whole graph.

Compared with methods which do not exploit the relationship be tween samples, experiments showing advantages of graph-based learning methods can be found 1210 in (Rao and Ravichandran, 2009), (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006), (Tong et al, 2005), (Wan and Xiao,2009), (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002) etc. When labeled data are scarce, such graph-based transductive learning methods are especially useful. $$$$$ With the graph defined, there are several algorithms one can use to carry out semi-supervised learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Delalleau et al., 2005; Joachims, 2003; Blum and Chawla, 2001; Belkin et al., 2005).

Our approach accounts for intercategory relationships from the outset of classifier design, rather than addressing this issue with later adjustments. Goldberg and Zhu (2006) proposed a semisupervised learning approach to the rating inference problem in scenarios where labeled training data is scarce. $$$$$ In particular Pang and Lee proposed the rating-inference problem (2005).

In NLP, label propagation has been used for word sense disambiguation (Niu et al, 2005), document classification (Zhu, 2005), sentiment analysis (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006), and relation extraction (Chen et al, 2006). $$$$$ Sentiment analysis of text documents has received considerable attention recently (Shanahan et al., 2005; Turney, 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Chaovalit and Zhou, 2005).
