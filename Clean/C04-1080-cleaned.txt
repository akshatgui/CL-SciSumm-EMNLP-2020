While replicating earlier experiments, Banko and Moore (2004) discovered that performance was highly dependent on cleaning tag dictionaries using statistics gleaned from the tokens. $$$$$ When using tag to the left and tag to the right as features in addition to the current tag, accuracy improved to 96.55%.

Second, the expectation maximization algorithm for bi tag HMMs is efficient and has been shown to be quite effective for acquiring accurate POS taggers given only a lexicon (tag dictionary) and certain favorable conditions (Banko and Moore, 2004). $$$$$ Second we describe a method for sequential unsupervised training of tag sequence and lexical probabilities in an HMM, which we observe leads to improved accuracy over simultaneous training with certain types of models.

To consider the effect of the CCG-based initialization for lexicons with differing ambiguity, I use tag cutoffs that remove any lexical entry containing a category that appears with a particular word less than X% of the time (Banko and Moore, 2004), as well as using no cutoffs at all. $$$$$ 4.2 The Effect of Lexicon Construction on.

However, as Banko and Moore (2004) point out, the accuracy achieved by these unsupervised methods depends strongly on the precise nature of the supervised training data (in their case, the ambiguity of the tag lexicon available to the system), which makes it more difficult to understand the behaviour of such systems. $$$$$ Observing that the quality of the lexicon greatly impacts the accuracy that can be achieved by the algorithms, we present a method of HMM training that improves accuracy when training of lexical probabilities is unstable.

Banko and Moore (2004) compared unsupervised HMM and transformation-based taggers trained on the same portions of the Penn Treebank, and showed that the quality of the lexicon used for training had a high impact on the tagging results. Duh and Kirchhoff (2005) presented a minimally supervised approach to tagging for dialectal Arabic (Colloquial Egyptian), based on a morphological analyzer for Modern Standard Arabic and unlabeled texts in a number of dialects. $$$$$ In section 6, we revisit our new approach to HMM tagging, this time, in the supervised framework.

One difficulty with their approach ,noted by Banko and Moore (2004), is the treatment of unseen words $$$$$ We did not begin with any estimates of the likelihoods of tags for words, but only the knowledge of what tags are possible for each word in the lexicon, i.e., something we could obtain from a manually-constructed dictionary.

The reason why Banko and Moore (2004) get less than HunPos is not because their system is inherently worse, but rather because it lacks the engineering hacks built into TnT and HunPos. $$$$$ In contrast to the HMM taggers previously described, which make use of contextual information coming from the left side only, UTBL considers both left and right contexts.

by Banko and Moore (2004), these works made use of filtered dictionaries $$$$$ Since we are not starting out with any known estimates for probabilities of tags given a word, the learner considers this tag to be just as likely as the word?s other, more probable, possibilities.
