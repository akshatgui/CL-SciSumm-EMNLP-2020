The SA component is implemented according to Jiang et al (2011), which incorporates target-dependent features and considers related tweets by utilizing a graph-based optimization. $$$$$ For these tweets, our graph-based optimization approach will have no effect.

For target-dependent sentiment classification, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011). $$$$$ Based on our manual evaluation of Twitter Sentiment output, about 40% of errors are because of this (see Section 6.1 for more details).

Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ Besides target-independent features, we also incorporate target-dependent features in both the subjectivity classifier and polarity classifier.
Jiang et al (2011) combine the target-independent features (content and lexicon) and target-dependent features (rules based on the dependency parsing results) together in subjectivity classification and polarity classification for tweets. $$$$$ Both of these indicate that targetdependent features are more useful for improving subjectivity classification than for polarity classification.

These features are all target-independent. SVMdep $$$$$ We also re-implemented the method proposed in (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) for comparison.

This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ In our classifiers, most of these features are also used.
This is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,2011) used to extract the target-dependent features. $$$$$ Following (Go et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2002), we use accuracy as a metric in our experiments.

However, labeled data is expensive to create, and examples of Twitter classifiers trained on hand-labeled data are few (Jiang et al 2011). $$$$$ As Twitter becomes more popular, sentiment analysis on Twitter data becomes more attractive.
However, labeled data is expensive to create, and examples of Twitter classifiers trained on hand-labeled data are few (Jiang et al 2011). $$$$$ For each query, we randomly select 20 tweets labeled as positive or negative by TS.

Subjectivity classification of small units of text, such as individual micro blog posts (Jiang et al, 2011) and sentences (Riloff et al, 2003), has been shown to benefit from additional context. $$$$$ (Go et al., 2009; Parikh and Movassate, 2009; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Davidiv et al., 2010) all follow the machine learning based approach for sentiment classification of tweets.
