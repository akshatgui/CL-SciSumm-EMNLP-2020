 $$$$$ What exactly would a method for lexical decomposition give us?

Our view of relations in a concept network being the interpretations of metonymies is strongly reminiscent of older work in metonymy resolution such as Hobbs et al1993), Fass (1991), Markert and Hahn (2002) or the use of a generative lexicon and its relations in Pustejovsky (1991), which also are unsupervised. $$$$$ The Generative Lexicon

The term quale (plural :qualia) is borrowed from Pustejovsky (1991). $$$$$ Pustejovsky 1989a), where the verb has coerced the meaning of a term phrase into a different semantic type.

To provide semantics for nouns, we use CoreLex (Buitelaar, 1998), in turn based on the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991). $$$$$ The Generative Lexicon

CoreLex is based on a different theory than Levin's (that of the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991)), but does provide a compatible decompositional meaning representation for nouns. $$$$$ The Generative Lexicon
CoreLex is based on a different theory than Levin's (that of the generative lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991)), but does provide a compatible decompositional meaning representation for nouns. $$$$$ What we are led to, therefore, is a generative theory of word meaning, but one very different from the generative semantics of the 1970s.

The idea that noun meaning involves event-based description has been particularly emphasized by J. Pustejovsky (1991). $$$$$ One level of semantic description involves an event-based interpretation of a word or phrase.

This semantic framework demonstrates that the association between nominal constituents and underlying predicative relation in root compounds is not arbitrary: it involves conceptual mechanisms that are triggered in other linguistic phenomena such as type coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991), anaphora (Fradin, 1984) or adjectival constructions (Bouillon and Viegas, 1993). $$$$$ I suggest that these are cases of semantic type coercion (cf.

Such compounds illustrate the notion of co-compositionality (Pustejovsky 1991). $$$$$ For a full discussion, see Pustejovsky (1988, 1991).

Pustejovsky (1991) refers to this kind of relation as co specification i.e. like verb can select for its argument type, an argument also can select its associated predicates. $$$$$ Thus, just as a verb can select for an argument-type, we can imagine that an argument is itself able to select the predicates that govern it.

The associated predicate information is included in the qualia structure of a lexical item (Pustejovsky, 1991). $$$$$ The essential opposition denoted by a predicate forms part of what I will call the qualia structure of that lexical item.

I declare that Korean common nouns have both the RESTR (ICTION) for normal semantics and the QUALIA-ST (RUCTURE), which in turn has the AGENTIVE and TELIC attributes, adopting the basic idea from Pustejovsky (1991). $$$$$ The basic idea I will pursue is the following.

The VPs with the verbs start or finish (see Pustejovsky, 1991) can also be accounted for using the qualia structure. $$$$$ Example 5 The exact meaning of the verb finish varies depending on the object it selects, assuming for these examples the meanings finish smoking or finish drinking.

The vast space between these two extremes can still be explained in terms of compositional principles with mechanisms from GLT such as type coercion and sub selection (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1993). $$$$$ I will argue that such degrees of salience or coherence relations can be explained in structural terms by examining a network of related lexical items.&quot; I will illustrate the distinction between these mechanisms by considering the two sentences in Example 58, and their relative prototypicality. a.

The basic sense originates derived usages, which are more or less constrained and limited, via metonymy, metaphor, slight sense-shiftings or co-composition (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995). $$$$$ These interpretations are all derived from a single word sense for fast.

Finally, SEMANTIC COLLOCATIONS like long book derive their particular meaning from the recovery in context of parameters for events and other entities (Pustejovsky, 1991). $$$$$ Thus, we can derive both word senses of verbs like bake by putting some of the semantic weight on the NP.

Qualia structures have been originally introduced by (Pustejovsky, 1991) and are used for a variety of purposes in natural language processing (NLP). $$$$$ Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness of the grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems must account for these differences in their lexicons and grammars.
