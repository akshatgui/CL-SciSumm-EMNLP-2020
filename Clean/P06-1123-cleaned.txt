Wellington et al. (2006) reports that discontinuities are very useful for translational equivalence analysis using binary branching structures under word alignment and parse tree constraints while they are almost of no use if under word alignment constraints only. $$$$$ To measure the number of gaps needed to generate a given word alignment, we used a bottom-up hierarchical alignment algorithm to infer a binary synchronous parse tree that was consistent with the alignment, using as few gaps as possible.
Wellington et al. (2006) reports that discontinuities are very useful for translational equivalence analysis using binary branching structures under word alignment and parse tree constraints while they are almost of no use if under word alignment constraints only. $$$$$ There were surprisingly many examples of such patterns that could not be analyzed using binary-branching structures without discontinuities.

In this sense, our model behaves like a phrase based model, less sensitive to discontinuous phrases (Wellington et al, 2006). $$$$$ For example, given a sentence pair like (he left slowly /slowly he left) with the correct word alignment, a phrase-based translation model can add a single 3-word biphrase to its phrase table.

We propose SG-ITG that follows Wellington et al (2006)'s suggestion to model at most one gap. $$$$$ Decomposing the translational equivalence relations in the training data into smaller units of knowledge can improve a model’s ability to generalize (Zhang et al., 2006).

Grammar rules extracted from large parallel corpora by systems such as Galley et al (2004) can be quite large, and Wellington et al (2006) argue that complex rules are necessary by analyzing the coverage of gold-standard word alignments from different language pairs by various grammars. $$$$$ We would expect the opposite effect with hand-aligned data (Galley et al., 2004).

The methodology in Wellington et al (2006) measures the complexity of word alignment using the number of gaps that are necessary for their synchronous parser which allows discontinuous spans to succeed in parsing. $$$$$ Our study measured the complexity of a word alignment as the minimum number of gaps needed to generate it under the following constraints: Our measure of alignment complexity is analogous to what Melamed et al. (2004) call “fanout.”3 The least complex alignments on this measure — those that can be generated with zero gaps — are precisely those that can be generated by an mum/median/maximum sentence lengths in each bitext.

Wellington et al (2006) indicate the necessity of introducing discontinuous spans for synchronous parsing to match up with human-annotated word alignment data. $$$$$ So unlike some other studies (Zens and Ney, 2003; Zhang et al., 2006), we used manually annotated alignments instead of automatically generated ones.

In particular, Wellington et al (2006) find that the coverage of a translation model can increase dramatically when one allows a bilingual phrase to stretch out over three rather than two continuous substrings. $$$$$ To increase the chances that a translation model can explain complex word alignments, some authors have proposed various ways of extending a model’s domain of locality.
