A bootstrapping approach using machine learning is a possible alternative that will be explored in the future (Abney 2002). $$$$$ However, three other cases are possible.

Abney (2002) suggests that the disagreement rate of two independent hypotheses upper-bounds the error rate of either hypothesis. $$$$$ They show that, if view independence is satisfied, then the agreement rate between opposing-view rules F and G upper bounds the error of F (or G).
Abney (2002) suggests that the disagreement rate of two independent hypotheses upper-bounds the error rate of either hypothesis. $$$$$ Theorem 2 states that disagreement upper bounds error.

In recent work, (Abney, 2002) shows that the independence assumption can be relaxed, and co-training is still effective under a weaker independence assumption. $$$$$ I show that that independence assumption is remarkably powerful, and violated in the data; however, I show that a weaker assumption suffices.
In recent work, (Abney, 2002) shows that the independence assumption can be relaxed, and co-training is still effective under a weaker independence assumption. $$$$$ The first assumption is precision independence.

However, as theoretically shown in (Abney, 2002), and then empirically in (Clark et al,2003), co-training still works under a weaker independence assumption, and the results we obtain concur with these previous observations. $$$$$ In this section, we introduce a weaker assumption, one that is satisfied by the data, and we show that theorem 2 holds under this weaker assumption.

Dasgupta et al (2001) and Abney (2002) conducted theoretical analyses on the performance (generalization error) of co-training. $$$$$ The second lack is emended in (Dasgupta et al., 2001).

Abney (2002) refined Dasgupta et als result by relaxing the view independence assumption with a new constraint. $$$$$ First, (Dasgupta et al., 2001) assume the same conditional independence assumption as proposed by Blum and Mitchell.

Rather than comparing the two learners on whether they categorically select the same preferred parse on a number of examples, we can view active learning as the inverse of agreement-based co-training (Abney, 2002). $$$$$ They also give an intuitive explanation of why co-training works, in terms of maximizing agreement on unlabeled data between classifiers based on different “views” of the data.

Further avenues to explore include the development of selection methods to efficiently approximate maximizing the objective function of parser agreement on unlabeled data, following the work of Dasgupta et al (2002) and Abney (2002). $$$$$ In recent work, (Dasgupta et al., 2001) prove that a classifier has low generalization error if it agrees on unlabeled data with a second classifier based on a different “view” of the data.

We have implemented the Greedy Agreement Algorithm (Abney, 2002) which, based on two independent views of the data, is able to learn two binary classifiers from a set of hand-typed seed rules. $$$$$ They also give an intuitive explanation of why co-training works, in terms of maximizing agreement on unlabeled data between classifiers based on different “views” of the data.

See (Abney, 2002) for a formal proof that this algorithm tends to gradually reduce the classification error given the adequate seed rules. $$$$$ I give a geometric proof sketch here; the reader is referred to the original paper for a formal proof.

Third, how the algorithm, presented in (Abney, 2002) for binary classification, can be extended to a multi class problem. $$$$$ A binary rule F can be thought of as the characteristic function of the set of instances {x : F(x) = +}.
Third, how the algorithm, presented in (Abney, 2002) for binary classification, can be extended to a multi class problem. $$$$$ Multi-class rules also define useful sets when a particular target class t is understood.

These results are comparable to the ones presented in (Abney, 2002), taking into account, apart from the language change, that we have introduced a fourth class to be treated the same as the other three. $$$$$ The plenitude of unlabeled natural language data, and the paucity of labeled data, have made bootstrapping a topic of interest in computational linguistics.

Theorem 5 in (Abney, 2002) provides a theoretical explanation for these results: if certain independence conditions between the classifier rules are satisfied and the precision of each rule is larger than a threshold T, then the precision of the final classifier is larger than T. $$$$$ The precision of F is P(Y

Abney (2002) presents an analysis to relax the (fairly strong) conditional independence assumption to weak rule dependence. $$$$$ Rule independence is a very strong assumption; one remarkable consequence will show just how strong it is.
Abney (2002) presents an analysis to relax the (fairly strong) conditional independence assumption to weak rule dependence. $$$$$ If p1 = 0.5, then weak rule dependence reduces to independence: if p1 = 0.5 and weak rule dependence is satisfied, then dy must be 0, which is to say, F and G must be conditionally independent.

Although this result was previously observed in a different context by Abney in (Abney, 2002), he does not use it to derive a semi-supervised learning algorithm. $$$$$ disambiguation rivaling supervised methods.
Although this result was previously observed in a different context by Abney in (Abney, 2002), he does not use it to derive a semi-supervised learning algorithm. $$$$$ The proof they give does not actually apply directly to the co-training algorithm, nor does it directly justify the intuitive account in terms of classifier agreement on unlabeled data, nor, for that matter, does the co-training algorithm directly seek to find classifiers that agree on unlabeled data.

Semantic Classifiers Bootstrapping refers to a problem of inducing a classifier given a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data (Abney, 2002). $$$$$ The term bootstrapping here refers to a problem setting in which one is given a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data, and the task is to induce a classifier.

Co-training algorithms such as CoBoost (Collins and Singer, 1999) and Greedy Agreement (Abney, 2002) that explicitly trade classifier agreement on unlabeled data against error on labeled data may be more robust to the underlying assumptions of co-training and can conceivably perform better than the Blum and Mitchell algorithm for problems without a natural feature split. $$$$$ The algorithm that Blum and Mitchell describe does not explicitly search for rules with good agreement; nor does agreement rate play any direct role in the learnability proof given in the Blum and Mitchell paper.
