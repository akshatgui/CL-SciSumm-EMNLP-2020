The first comparison of NLG evaluation techniques which we are aware of is by Bangalore et al (2000). $$$$$ To our knowledge, the first to use stochastic techniques in an NLG realization module were Langkilde and Knight (1998a) and (1998b) (see also (Langkilde, 2000)).

Bangalore et al describe some of the quantitative measures that have been used in (Bangalore et al, 2000). $$$$$ .We conducted a series of linear regressions with normalized judgments of understanding and quality as the dependent measures and as independent measures different combinations of one of our four metrics with sentence length, and with the &quot;problem&quot; variables that we used to define the string metrics (S, I, D, Al, , D' - see Section 3 for definitions).

In contrast, quantitative metrics for automatic evaluation of surface realisers have been developed (Bangalore et al, 2000) and they have been shown to correlate well with human judgement for quality and understandability. $$$$$ The experiment confirms that intrinsic metrics cannot replace human evaluation, but some correlate significantly with human judgments of quality and understandability and can be used for evaluation during development.
