Because of the fundamental nature of the semantic similarity problem, there are close connections with other areas of human language technologies such as information retrieval (Salton and Lesk, 1971), text alignment in machine translation (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), text summarization (Mani and Maybury, 1999), and textual coherence (Foltz et al, 1998). $$$$$ Attempts at combining the output of different systems have proved useful in other areas of language technologies, such as the ROVER approach for speech recognition (Fiscus 1997).

 $$$$$ A hypothesis is considered “complete” if the next word chosen to extend the hypothesis is the explicit end-of-sentence marker from one of the original translation strings.
 $$$$$ We wish to thank Robert Frederking, Ralf Brown and Jaime Carbonell for their valuable input and suggestions.

(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) tried to overcome this problem by using confidence scores and language models in order to rank a collection of synthetic combinations of words extracted from the original translation hypotheses. $$$$$ A decoding algorithm uses explicit word matches, in conjunction with confidence estimates for the various engines and a trigram language model in order to score and rank a collection of sentence hypotheses that are synthetic combinations of words from the various original engines.

Combination techniques have earlier been applied to various applications including machine translation (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), part-of-speech tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998) and base noun phrase identification (Sang et al., 2000). $$$$$ The Pangloss system and work by several other researchers attempted to combine lattices from many different MT systems (Frederking et Nirenburg 1994, Frederking et al 1997; Tidhar & Küssner 2000; Lavie, Probst et al. 2004).

Our system is an enhancement of our previous work (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005). $$$$$ After the matcher has word aligned the original system translations, the decoder goes to work.
Our system is an enhancement of our previous work (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005). $$$$$ Each iteration expands the previous set of partial hypotheses, resulting in a large space of complete synthetic hypotheses.

The algorithm is described fully by Jayaraman and Lavie (2005). $$$$$ The alignment algorithm described in that work, which only allows insertions, deletions and substitutions, does not accurately capture long range phrase movement.
The algorithm is described fully by Jayaraman and Lavie (2005). $$$$$ Furthermore, our MEMT algorithm produces hypotheses that are of yet even better quality, but our current scoring algorithm is not yet able to effectively select the best hypothesis.

Also, a more heuristic alignment method has been proposed in a different system combination approach (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005). $$$$$ Each approach and system has different advantages and disadvantages.
Also, a more heuristic alignment method has been proposed in a different system combination approach (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005). $$$$$ MEMT first aligns the words of the different translation systems using a word alignment matcher.

Other than confusion-network-based algorithms, work most closely related to ours is the method of MT system combination proposed in (Jayaraman and Lavie 2005), which we will refer to as J&L. $$$$$ In this paper, we propose a new way of combining the translations of multiple MT systems based on a more versatile word alignment algorithm.
Other than confusion-network-based algorithms, work most closely related to ours is the method of MT system combination proposed in (Jayaraman and Lavie 2005), which we will refer to as J&L. $$$$$ METEOR produces scores in the range of [0,1], based on a combination of unigram precision, unigram recall and an explicit penalty related to the average length of matched segments between the evaluated translation and its reference.

Jayaraman and Lavie (2005) proposed a heuristic-based matching algorithm which allows non monotonic alignments to align the words between the hypotheses. $$$$$ To simultaneously align more than two sentences, the matcher simply produces alignments for all pair-wise combinations of the set of sentences.
Jayaraman and Lavie (2005) proposed a heuristic-based matching algorithm which allows non monotonic alignments to align the words between the hypotheses. $$$$$ Second, the alignment information allows the algorithm to ensure that aligned words are not included in a synthetic combination more than once.

(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) proposed another black-box system combination strategy. $$$$$ Our approach uses the individual MT engines as “black boxes” and does not require any explicit cooperation from the original MT systems.
(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) proposed another black-box system combination strategy. $$$$$ Several approaches to multi-engine machine translation systems have been proposed over the past decade.

Karakos, et al (2008) proposed an ITG based method for hypothesis alignment, Rosti et al (2008) proposed an incremental alignment method, and a heuristic-based matching algorithm was proposed by Jayaraman and Lavie (2005). $$$$$ The Pangloss system and work by several other researchers attempted to combine lattices from many different MT systems (Frederking et Nirenburg 1994, Frederking et al 1997; Tidhar & Küssner 2000; Lavie, Probst et al. 2004).
