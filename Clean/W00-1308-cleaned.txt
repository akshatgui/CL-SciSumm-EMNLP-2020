The primary reason for the large disparity between the Brill tagger output and original Penn Treebank annotation is that it is notoriously difficult to differentiate between particles, prepositions and adverbs (Toutanova and Manning, 2000). $$$$$ We tried to improve the tagger's capability to resolve these ambiguities through adding information on verbs' preferences to take specific words as particles, or adverbs, or prepositions.

In order to make a fair comparison between the human texts and our own, we used a part-of-speech (POS) tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000) to extract those grammatical categories that we aim to control within our framework, i.e. nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives and adverbs. $$$$$ For example, the accuracy on nouns is greater than the accuracy on adjectives.

Toutanova and Manning (2000), Toutanova et al (2003), Lafferty et al (2001) and Vadas and Curran (2005) used additional language-specific morphological or syntactic features. $$$$$ Following Berger et al. (1996), we approximate p(h,t) , the joint distribution of contexts and tags, by the product of r, (h), the empirical distribution of histories h, and the conditional distribution p(t I h)

The features used in this work are typical for modern MEMM POS tagging and are mostly based on work by Toutanova and Manning (2000). $$$$$ This paper presents results for a maximumentropy-based part of speech tagger, which achieves superior performance principally by enriching the information sources used for tagging.

We used the Stanford log-linear POS tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000) in this study. $$$$$ Enriching The Knowledge Sources Used In A Maximum Entropy Part-Of-Speech Tagger
We used the Stanford log-linear POS tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000) in this study. $$$$$ There seems to be still considerable room to improve these results, though the attainable accuracy is limited by the accuracy with which these distinctions are marked in the Penn Treebank (on a quick informal study, this accuracy seems to be around 85%).

We use the Google Web 1T data (Brants and Franz (2006)), and POS-tagged ngrams using Stanford POS Tagger (Toutanova and Manning (2000)). $$$$$ Among recent top performing methods are Hidden Markov Models (Brants 2000), maximum entropy approaches (Ratnaparkhi 1996), and transformation-based learning (Brill 1994).

Under the hypothesis that action item utterances will exhibit particular syntactic patterns, we use a conditional Markov model part-of-speech (POS) tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000) trained on the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey et al, 1992) to tag utterance words for part of speech. $$$$$ These look a lot like the statistics a Markov Model would use.

We apply the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000) on Twitter messages, and only select nouns and adjectives as valid candidates for user tags. $$$$$ The model assigns a probability for every tag t in the set T of possible tags given a word and its context h, which is usually defined as the sequence of several words and tags preceding the word.

We consider a word as a predicate if it is tagged as a verb by a Part-of-Speech tagger (Toutanova and Manning, 2000). $$$$$ We added two different feature templates to capture this information, consisting as usual of a predicate on the history h, and a condition on the tag t. The first predicate is true if the current word is often used as a particle, and if there is a verb at most 3 positions to the left, which is &quot;known&quot; to have a good chance of taking the current word as a particle.

It uses a maximum-entropy approach to handle information diversity without assuming predictor independence (Toutanova and Manning, 2000). $$$$$ We adopt a maximum entropy approach because it allows the inclusion of diverse sources of information without causing fragmentation and without necessarily assuming independence between the predictors.

Following Toutanova and Manning (2000) approximately, more information is defined for words that are considered rare (which we define here as words that occur fewer than fifteen times). $$$$$ Special feature templates exist for rare words in the training data, to increase the model's prediction capacity for unknown words.

This is the best automatically learned part-of-speech tagging result known to us, representing an error reduction of 4.4% on the model presented in Collins (2002), using the same data splits, and a larger error reduction of 12.1% from the more similar best previous log linear model in Toutanova and Manning (2000). $$$$$ For example, the error on the proper noun category (NNP) accounts for a significantly larger percent of the total error for unknown words than for known words.
