This approach has also been extended to incorporate a pronunciation model (Toutanova and Moore, 2002). $$$$$ However this model makes residual errors, many of which have to do with word pronunciation.

Neither do we require pairs of misspelled names and their correct spellings for learning the error model unlike (Brill and Moore, 2000) or large-coverage general purpose lexicon for unlike (Cucerzan and Brill, 2004) or pronunciation dictionaries unlike (Toutanova and Moore, 2002). $$$$$ More specifically, we build two different error models using the Brill and Moore learning algorithm.
