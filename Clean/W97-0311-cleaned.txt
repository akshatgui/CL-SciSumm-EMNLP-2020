Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multi word compounds in bi texts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model. $$$$$ The method is based on the insight that treatment of NCCs as multiple words reduces the predictive power of translation models.
Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multi word compounds in bi texts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model. $$$$$ Comparison of predictive value functions across translation models can only be done under Let i and i' be the predictive value functions for source words in the base translation model and in the trial translation model, respectively.

 $$$$$ The mutual exclusion condition implies that multiple tests must be performed to find the majority of NCCs in a given text.

Instead, we develop a new scoring criterion, based on Melamed (1997). $$$$$ A translation model can be constructed automatically from texts that exist in two languages (bitexts) (Brown et al., 1993; Melamed, 1997).

Melamed (1997) and Lin (1999) have done some research on non compositional phrases discovery. $$$$$ There has been some research into matching compositional phrases across bitexts.

Some applications that would benefit from knowing this distinction are machine translation (Imamura et al, 2003), finding paraphrases (Bannardand Callison-Burch, 2005), (multilingual) information retrieval (Melamed, 1997a), etc. $$$$$ Treating NCCs as multiple words degrades the performance of machine translation (MT), information retrieval, natural language generation, and most other NLP applications.
