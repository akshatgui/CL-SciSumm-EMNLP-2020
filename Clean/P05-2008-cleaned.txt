In sentiment analysis research, Read (2005) used emoticons in newsgroup articles to extract instances relevant for training polarity classifiers. $$$$$ One might suppose that dependency is occurring because classifiers are learning the semantic sentiment of texts rather than the general sentiment of language used.

We therefore experiment with multiple such conventions with apparently similar meanings - here, emoticons (following (Read, 2005)) and Twitter hash tags - allowing us to examine the similarity of classifiers trained on independent labels but intended to detect the same underlying class. $$$$$ Figure 1 shows the results of this experiment.

The regulating aspects of semantic orientation of a text are natural language context information (Pang et al, 2002) language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005) and lastly most challenging is the time dimension (Read, 2005). $$$$$ We conducted an experiment to compare the accuracy when training a classifier on one domain (newswire articles or movie reviews from the Polarity 1.0 dataset used by Pang et al. (2002)) and testing on the other domain.

(2002) when they created the Polarity 1.0 dataset.

We have built a corpus of tweets written in English following the procedure described in (Read, 2005) and (Go et al, 2009). $$$$$ A review was ignored if it was not written in 2003 or 2004 (ensuring that the review was written after any in the Polarity 1.0 dataset).
We have built a corpus of tweets written in English following the procedure described in (Read, 2005) and (Go et al, 2009). $$$$$ This procedure yielded a corpus of 716 negative and 2,669 positive reviews.

According to (Read, 2005), when authors of an electronic communication use an emotion, they are effectively marking up their own text with an emotional state. $$$$$ Users of electronic methods of communication have developed visual cues that are associated with emotional states in an attempt to state the emotion that their text represents.

The regulating aspects which govern the lexical level semantic orientation are natural language context (Pang et al, 2002), language properties (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006), domain pragmatic knowledge (Aue and Gamon, 2005), time dimension (Read, 2005), colors and culture (Strapparava and Ozbal, 2010) and many more unrevealed hidden aspects. $$$$$ We conducted an experiment to compare the accuracy when training a classifier on one domain (newswire articles or movie reviews from the Polarity 1.0 dataset used by Pang et al.

We seed the graph using the polarity values in the OpinionFinder lexicon (Wilson et al, 2005), the known polarity of emoticons, and a maximum entropy classifier trained on 1.8 million tweets with automatically assigned labels based on the presence of positive and negative emoticons, like Read (2005) and Go et al (2009). $$$$$ Pang et al. (2002) used a bagof-features framework (based on unigrams and bigrams) to train these models from a corpus of movie reviews labelled as positive or negative.

(2002) found that this is the most effective strategy for sentiment classification.

It is not a static sentiment lexicon set [polarity changes with time (Read, 2005)] as it is updated regularly. $$$$$ To investigate the effect of time on sentiment classification, we constructed a new set of movie reviews, following the same approach used by Pang et al.

It is not a static sentiment lexicon set [polarity changes with time (Read, 2005)] as it is updated regularly. $$$$$ A possible reason for this is that Polarity 2004 data is from a much smaller time-period than that represented by Polarity 1.0.

We use emoticons as indicators of an emotion (Read, 2005) to automatically classify texts into positive or negative sets. $$$$$ In this paper, for uniformity across different data sets, we focus on only positive and negative sentiment.

The approach is similar to the one in (Read, 2005). $$$$$ However, EngstrÂ¨om (2004) showed that the bagof-features approach is topic-dependent.
