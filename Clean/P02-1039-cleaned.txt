In comparison, in (Yamada and Knight, 2002), which was a phrasal structure based statistical MT system for Chinese to English translation, the Bleu score reported for short sentences (less than 14 words) is 0.099 to 0.102. $$$$$ A Decoder For Syntax-Based Statistical MT
In comparison, in (Yamada and Knight, 2002), which was a phrasal structure based statistical MT system for Chinese to English translation, the Bleu score reported for short sentences (less than 14 words) is 0.099 to 0.102. $$$$$ We selected 347 short sentences (less than 14 words in the reference English translation) from the held-out portion of the corpus, and they were used for evaluation.

Here, we used a model defined by Yamada and Knight (2001) and Yamada and Knight (2002). Internally, the model performs three types of operations on each node of a parse tree. $$$$$ This paper describes a decoding algorithm for a syntax-based translation model (Yamada and Knight, 2001).

The model is further extended to incorporate phrasal translations performed at each node of the input parse tree (Yamada and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ The model has been extended to incorporate phrasal translations as presented here.

The syntactically supervised model has been found to outperform the IBM word-level alignment models of Brown et al (1993) for translation by Yamada and Knight (2002). $$$$$ For the IBM models defined by a pioneering paper (Brown et al., 1993), a decoding algorithm based on a left-to-right search was described in (Berger et al., 1996).

(Yamada and Knight, 2002) propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence. $$$$$ The syntax-based TM defined by (Yamada and Knight, 2001) assumes an English parse tree as a channel input.

As an alternative option to our verb-modifier experiments, structured language models (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) might be considered to improve clause coherence, until full-featured syntax-based MT models (Yamada and Knight (2002), Eisner (2003), Chiang (2005) among many others) are tested when translating to morphologically rich languages. $$$$$ A Decoder For Syntax-Based Statistical MT

It follows the decoding-as-parsing idea exemplified by Wu (1996) and Yamada and Knight (2002). $$$$$ Section 4 presents the basic idea for decoding.

For reasons of speed, Yamada and Knight (2002) limited training to sentences of length 30, and were able to use only one fifth of the available Chinese-English parallel corpus. $$$$$ We used a Chinese-English translation corpus for the experiment.

One way to approach reordering is by extending the translation model, either by adding extra models, such as lexicalized (Koehn et al, 2005) or discriminative (Zens and Ney, 2006) reordering models or by directly modelling reordering in hierarchical (Chiang, 2007) or syntactical translation models (Yamada and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ This is because the reordering probability is always 1.
