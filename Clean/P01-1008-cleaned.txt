Inspired by the use of parallel translations to mine paraphrasing lexicons (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) and the use of MT engines forword sense disambiguation (Diab, 2000), we leverage existing machine translation systems to generate semantically equivalent, albeit lexically and syntactically distinct, questions. $$$$$ Our method for paraphrase extraction builds upon methodology developed in Machine Translation (MT).

The approach in (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) does not use deep linguistic analysis and therefore is suitable to noisy corpora like ours. $$$$$ A corpus-based approach can provide insights on this question by revealing paraphrases that people use.
The approach in (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) does not use deep linguistic analysis and therefore is suitable to noisy corpora like ours. $$$$$ This characteristic of our corpus is similar to problems with noisy and comparable corpora (Veronis, 2000), and it prevents us from using methods developed in the MT community based on clean parallel corpora, such as (Brown et al., 1993).
