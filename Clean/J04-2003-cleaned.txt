In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ The vocabulary of the new representation of the German part of the Verbmobil corpus, for example, in which full word forms are replaced by base form plus morphological and syntactic tags (lemmatag representation), is one and a half times as large as the vocabulary of the original corpus.
In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model. $$$$$ To enable the application of the hierarchical lexicon model, the source language input sentences in test have to be analyzed and annotated with their lemma-tag representation before the actual translation process.

There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004). $$$$$ This is exactly what has been done to define the intermediate level in Section 4.2.
There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004). $$$$$ For testing we used the alignment template translation system, described in Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999).

Niessen and Ney (2004) used morphological decomposition to get better alignments. $$$$$ The information described in this section is used to improve the quality of statistical machine translation and to better exploit the available bilingual resources.

Niessen and Ney (2004) describe an approach for translation from German to English that combines verbs with associated particles, and also reorders questions. $$$$$ This is especially true for the task of translating from a more inflecting language like German into English, for instance: In parallel German/English corpora, the German part contains many more distinct word forms than the English part (see, for example, Table 5).

(Niessen and Ney, 2004) describe a method that combines morphologically split verbs in German, and also reorders questions in English and German. $$$$$ This is especially true for the task of translating from a more inflecting language like German into English, for instance: In parallel German/English corpora, the German part contains many more distinct word forms than the English part (see, for example, Table 5).
(Niessen and Ney, 2004) describe a method that combines morphologically split verbs in German, and also reorders questions in English and German. $$$$$ Such lists exist for German and English (see Table 7).

Among these were cases that can be handled such as separable prefix verbs like 'aufzeigten' ('pointed out') (Niessen and Ney, 2000) or adjective compounds such as 'multidimensionale' ('multi dimensional'). $$$$$ German prefix verbs consist of a main part and a detachable prefix, which can be shifted to the end of the clause.
