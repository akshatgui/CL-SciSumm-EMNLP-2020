Fortunately, we have found in (Gale et al, 1992) that the agreement rate can be very high (96.8%), which is well above the baseline, under very different experimental conditions. $$$$$ Table 4 shows that there was very high agreement among the judges.

We originally designed the experiment in Gale et al (1992) to test the hypothesis that multiple uses of a polysemous word tend to have the same sense within a common discourse. $$$$$ Our word-sense disambiguation algorithm uses the words in a 100-word context 1 surrounding the polysemous word very much like the other two applications use the words in a test document.
We originally designed the experiment in Gale et al (1992) to test the hypothesis that multiple uses of a polysemous word tend to have the same sense within a common discourse. $$$$$ In other words, there is a very strong tendency (98%) for multiple uses of a word to share the same sense in well-written coherent discourse.

We followed the well-known postulate (Gale et al, 1992) that all occurrences of a word in the same discourse tend to have the same sense (one sense per discourse), in order to decrease the annotator workload. $$$$$ That is, if a polysemous word such as sentence appears two or more times in a well-written discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same sense.

In order to improve the bootstrapping performance, we use the heuristic one tag per domain for multi word NE in addition to the one sense per discourse principle [Gale et al 1992]. $$$$$ In addition, it could also be used to help evaluate disambiguation algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint.
In order to improve the bootstrapping performance, we use the heuristic one tag per domain for multi word NE in addition to the one sense per discourse principle [Gale et al 1992]. $$$$$ Rather than tag- ging each instance of a polysemous word one-by-one, we can select discourses with large numbers of the polyse- mous word of interest and tag all of the instances in one fell swoop.

Apply the 'one sense per discourse' principle [Gale et al1992] for each disambiguated location name to propagate the selected sense to its other mentions within a document. $$$$$ Our word-sense disambiguation algorithm uses the words in a 100-word context 1 surrounding the polysemous word very much like the other two applications use the words in a test document.

It has been claimed (by Gale et al 1992) on the basis of corpus analysis that to a very large extent a word keeps the same meaning throughout a text. $$$$$ ABSTRACT It is well-known that there are polysemous words like sentence whose "meaning" or "sense" depends on the context of use.
It has been claimed (by Gale et al 1992) on the basis of corpus analysis that to a very large extent a word keeps the same meaning throughout a text. $$$$$ Rather than depending on small amounts of hand-tagged text, we have been making use of relatively large amounts of parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards, which are available in multiple languages.

This is a reasonable restriction supported by empirical evidence (see also (Gale et al 1992)). $$$$$ Clearly, we need to be fairly careful given that we have so many parameters and so little evidence.
This is a reasonable restriction supported by empirical evidence (see also (Gale et al 1992)). $$$$$ 2 A simple (but non-blind) preliminary experiment provided some suggestive evidence confirming the hypothesis.

For example, if two NPs are the same string in a given document, then it is more likely than not that they have the same semantic subtype according to the 'one sense per discourse' hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992). $$$$$ That is, if a polysemous word such as sentence appears two or more times in a well-written discourse, it is extremely likely that they will all share the same sense.
For example, if two NPs are the same string in a given document, then it is more likely than not that they have the same semantic subtype according to the 'one sense per discourse' hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992). $$$$$ The second condition, for example, would exclude bank, perhaps the canoni- cal example of a polysemous noun, since there are very few instances of the "river" sense of bank in our corpus of Canadian Hansards.

In this case we cannot accept the general assumption of one sense per discourse (Gale et al, 1992), because words such as line, large in English or kljuch in Russian can function in the same discourse in a totally different sense. $$$$$ Moreover, the assumption that differences in translation correspond to differences in word-sense has always been somewhat suspect.

In the original one sense per discourse study, Gale et al (1992b) considered a sample of 9 polysemous English words. $$$$$ A Small Study We have looked at six polysemous nouns in some de- tail

 $$$$$ In fact, just as they had anticipated, we have found that only 2% of the vocabulary in the Federalist corpus has significantly different probabilities depending on the author.

While these numbers are not as high as the 94% agreement reported by Gale et al (1992b) in their empirical study, they still strongly support the one translation per discourse hypothesis. $$$$$ Table 4 shows that there was very high agreement among the judges.
While these numbers are not as high as the 94% agreement reported by Gale et al (1992b) in their empirical study, they still strongly support the one translation per discourse hypothesis. $$$$$ If we assume a mixture of 60% un- ambiguous words and 40% polysemous words, then the probability moves from 94% to 100% x .60 + 94% x .40 98%.

If more than one match of the same term is found in a document, we assume one sense-per-discourse (Gale et al, 1992) and jointly extract features for all matches of the term. $$$$$ Our word-sense disambiguation algorithm uses the words in a 100-word context 1 surrounding the polysemous word very much like the other two applications use the words in a test document.

Addressing word sense disambiguation, Gale et al (1992) introduced the idea of a word sense located at the discourse-level and observed a 93 strong one-sense-per-discourse tendency, i.e. several occurrences of a polysemous word form have a tendency to belong to the same semantic class within one discourse. $$$$$ In other words, there is a very strong tendency (98%) for multiple uses of a word to share the same sense in well-written coherent discourse.

Nonetheless, there are a non-negligible number of cases in which the one sense per discourse assumption (Gale et al, 1992) does not hold. $$$$$ It is a non-trivial task to estimate such a large number of pa- rameters, especially given the sparseness of the training data.
Nonetheless, there are a non-negligible number of cases in which the one sense per discourse assumption (Gale et al, 1992) does not hold. $$$$$ With the exception of judge 2, all of the judges agreed with the majority opinion in all but one or two of the 82 cases.

This effect of "meaning consistency" also known as the principle of "one sense per discourse" has been applied in word sense disambiguation with quite some success (Gale et al., 1992). $$$$$ ABSTRACT It is well-known that there are polysemous words like sentence whose "meaning" or "sense" depends on the context of use.
This effect of "meaning consistency" also known as the principle of "one sense per discourse" has been applied in word sense disambiguation with quite some success (Gale et al., 1992). $$$$$ Perhaps the word-sense disambiguation problem is not as difficult as we might have thought.

This property tends to hold for correct classifiers (Gale et al, 1992a), at least for homonyms. $$$$$ Yarowsky (1991) reports 93% correct disambiguation, averaged over the following words selected from the word-sense disambiguation liter- ature
