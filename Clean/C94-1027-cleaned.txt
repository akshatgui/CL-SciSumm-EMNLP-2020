For both tasks the reordering was performed as a preprocessing step using POS information from the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for German and using the Amira Tagger (Diab, 2009) for Arabic. $$$$$ A part-of-speech tagger is a system which automat- ically assigns the part of speech to words using con- textual information.
For both tasks the reordering was performed as a preprocessing step using POS information from the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for German and using the Amira Tagger (Diab, 2009) for Arabic. $$$$$ In the next step, an information measure I(S) was calculated for each node of the tree: I(S) = - ~ P(posiS ) tomd(p,>,qS) (7) po* IIere, S is the suffix which corresponds to the current node and P(poslS ) is the probability of tag pos given a word with suff ix S. Using this information measure, the suffix tree has been pruned.

The correct rate of tagging of these models has reached 95%, in part by using a very large amount of training data (e.g., 1,000,000 words in Schmid, 1994). $$$$$ Its performance was tested on a 100,000 word subpart which was not part of the training corlms.

The TreeTagger showed an accuracy of 96.06% (Schmid, 1994a). $$$$$ Table 2: Comparison of recognition rates method accuracy t Net-Tagger 96.22 % trigrarn tagger 96.06 % IIMM tagger 94.24 % G(less) = 95(1.32-  0.56) = 72,20 (11) Both wdues are well above a threshohl of 10, and there- fore none of them should be deleted.
The TreeTagger showed an accuracy of 96.06% (Schmid, 1994a). $$$$$ A comparison of the tagging results with those of a trigram tagger and a IIMM tagger showed that the accuracy is as high as that of the trigram tagger and the robustness on small training corpora is as good as that of the HMM tagger.

There have been attempts to apply neural networks to POS tagging (e.g., (Schmid, 1994)). $$$$$ A third and rather new approach is tagging with artificial neural networks.

We use the Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994) for all POS tagging except for Arabic, where we use the tagger described in Diab et al. $$$$$ In this paper, a new part-of-speech tagging method hased on neural networks (Net-Tagger) is pre- sented and its performance is compared to that of a llMM-tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) and a trigram- based tagger (Kempe, 1993).

We use TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) to produce POS tags and then open class words are restricted if the POS tagger assigned a tag with a probability over a certain threshold. $$$$$ First, a sujJiz tree wits constructed from the suffices of length 5 of sill words wliich were annotated with an open class l)art-of-speecli s. Then tag frequencies were cotlnted for all suffices and stored at the corresponding tree nodes.
