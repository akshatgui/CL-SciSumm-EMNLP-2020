For both tasks the reordering was performed as a preprocessing step using POS information from the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for German and using the Amira Tagger (Diab, 2009) for Arabic. $$$$$ A part-of-speech tagger is a system which automat- ically assigns the part of speech to words using con- textual information.

The correct rate of tagging of these models has reached 95%, in part by using a very large amount of training data (e.g., 1,000,000 words in Schmid, 1994). $$$$$ Its performance was tested on a 100,000 word subpart which was not part of the training corlms.

We use the Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1994) for all POS tagging except for Arabic, where we use the tagger described in Diab et al. $$$$$ In this paper, a new part-of-speech tagging method hased on neural networks (Net-Tagger) is pre- sented and its performance is compared to that of a llMM-tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) and a trigram- based tagger (Kempe, 1993).

We use TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) to produce POS tags and then open class words are restricted if the POS tagger assigned a tag with a probability over a certain threshold. $$$$$ First, a sujJiz tree wits constructed from the suffices of length 5 of sill words wliich were annotated with an open class l)art-of-speecli s. Then tag frequencies were cotlnted for all suffices and stored at the corresponding tree nodes.
