One system (Hall et al, 2007b) extends this two-stage approach to a three-stage architecture where the parser and labeler generate an n-best list of parses which in turn is reranked. $$$$$ The second parser is an ensemble system, which combines the output of six deterministic parsers, each of which is a variation of the Single Malt parser with parameter settings extrapolated from the first stage of optimization.
