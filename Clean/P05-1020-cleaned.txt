The main difference between this approach and ours is that (Ng, 2005)'s approach takes coreference resolution one step further, by comparing the results of multiple systems, while our system is a single resolver; furthermore, he emphasizes the global optimization of ranking clusters obtained locally, whereas our focus is on globally optimizing the clusterization method inside the resolver. $$$$$ Our approach.

There are many different training example generation algorithms, e.g., McCarthy and Lehnert's method, Soon et als method, Ng and Cardies method (Ng, 2005). $$$$$ In an attempt to reduce the training time, Soon et al.’s method creates a smaller number of training instances than McCarthy and Lehnert’s.

Similar to many previous works on co-reference (Ng, 2005), we cast the problem as a classification task and solve it in two steps: (1) train a classifier to determine whether two mentions are co-referent or not, and (2) use a clustering algorithm to partition the mentions into clusters, based on the pairwise predictions. $$$$$ Specifically, a classifier is first trained to determine whether two NPs in a document are co-referring or not.

Similarly, the method of (Ng, 2005) ranks base models according to their performance on separate tuning set, and then uses the highest-ranked base model for predicting on test documents. $$$$$ Given a test text, we use our coreference systems to create candidate partitions as in training, and select the highest-ranked partition according to the ranking model to be the final partition.3 The rest of this section describes how we select these learning-based coreference systems and acquire the ranking model.
