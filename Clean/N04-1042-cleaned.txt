See Peng and McCallum (2004) for more details and further experiments. $$$$$ Here we also briefly describe a HMM model we used in our experiments.

For this underlying model, we employ a chain structured conditional random field (CRF), since CRFs have been shown to perform better than other simple unconstrained models like hidden markov models for citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004). $$$$$ The first is hidden Markov models (HMM) (Seymore et al., 1999; Takasu, 2003).
For this underlying model, we employ a chain structured conditional random field (CRF), since CRFs have been shown to perform better than other simple unconstrained models like hidden markov models for citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004). $$$$$ Conditional random fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models trained to maximize a conditional probability (Lafferty et al., 2001).

Later, CRFs were shown to perform better on CORA, improving the results from the Hmm's token-level F1 of 86.6 to 91.5 with a CRF (Peng and McCallum, 2004). $$$$$ In our experiments we found the Gaussian prior to consistently perform better than the others.
Later, CRFs were shown to perform better on CORA, improving the results from the Hmm's token-level F1 of 86.6 to 91.5 with a CRF (Peng and McCallum, 2004). $$$$$ The results of using different features are shown in Table 6.

This approach is limited in its use of an HMM as an underlying model, as it has been shown that CRFs perform significantly better, achieving 95.37 token-level accuracy on CORA (Peng and McCallum, 2004). $$$$$ CRFs also perform significantly better than SVMbased approach, yielding new state of the art performance on this task.

In recent years discriminative probabilistic models have been successfully applied to a number of information extraction tasks in natural language processing (NLP), such as named entity recognition (NER) (McCallum and Li, 2003), noun phrase chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and information extraction from research papers (Peng and McCallum, 2004). $$$$$ Accurate Information Extraction From Research Papers Using Conditional Random Fields

For example, Peng and McCallum (2004) applied Conditional Random Fields to extract information, which draws together the advantages of both HMM and SVM. $$$$$ The CRF approach draws together the advantages of both finite state HMM and discriminative SVM techniques by allowing use of arbitrary, dependent features and joint inference over entire sequences.

This paper mainly focuses on the VP problem, since linguistic features for the HP problem is the general IE topic of much past research (e.g., Peng and McCallum, 2004). $$$$$ We study all these features in our research paper extraction problem, evaluate their individual contributions, and give some guidelines for selecting good features.
