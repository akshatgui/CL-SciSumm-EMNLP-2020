Early web-based models used search engines to collect N-gram counts, and thus could not use capitalization, punctuation, and annotations such as part-of-speech (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ Language identification algorithms (Beesley 1988; Grefenstette 1995), now widely used in Web search engines, were developed as NLP technology.
Early web-based models used search engines to collect N-gram counts, and thus could not use capitalization, punctuation, and annotations such as part-of-speech (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ Many Web search engines allow the user to search for adjacent phrases.

In corpus linguistics building such mega corpora is beyond the scope of individual researchers, and they are not easily accessible (Kennedy, 1998 $$$$$ Can they be used?
In corpus linguistics building such mega corpora is beyond the scope of individual researchers, and they are not easily accessible (Kennedy, 1998 $$$$$ Where researchers use established corpora, such as Brown, the BNC, or the Penn Treebank, researchers and readers are willing to accept the corpus name as a label for the type of text occurring in it without asking critical questions.

The Web contains vast amounts of linguistic data for many languages (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ The Web, teeming as it is with language data, of all manner of varieties and languages, in vast quantity and freely available, is a fabulous linguistsâ€™ playground.
The Web contains vast amounts of linguistic data for many languages (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ In fact, the text contains about 1,500 words.

In recent years, the Web has been increasingly used as a source of linguistic data (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ Language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the Web as a source of language data, because it is so big, because it is the only available source for the type of language in which they are interested, or simply because it is free and instantly available.
In recent years, the Web has been increasingly used as a source of linguistic data (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ Much work in recent years has gone into developing language models.

It is now easy to gather machine-readable sentences in various domains because of the ease of publication and access via the Web (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ These may be considered under four main headings

 $$$$$ They explore the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms (on a representative disambiguation task) as the size of the training corpus grows from a million to a billion words.
 $$$$$ Various alternative embeddings are evaluated using the CLEF (Peters 2001) multilingual information retrieval test beds.

The web as a corpus has been successfully used for many areas in NLP (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003) such as WSD (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999), obtaining frequencies for bigrams (Keller and Lapata 2003) and noun compound bracketing (Nakov and Hearst 2005). $$$$$ Rada Mihalcea and Dan Moldovan (1999) used hit counts for carefully constructed search engine queries to identify rank orders for word sense frequencies, as an input to a word sense disambiguation engine.

For Hungarian, the highest quality (4 % threshold) stratum of the corpus contains 1.22m unique pages for a total of 699m tokens, already exceeding the 500m predicted in (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ In 2003, Google claims to search four times this number of Web pages, which raises the number of bytes of text available just through this one Web server to over 20 terabytes from directly accessible Web pages.

For collecting bilingual text data for the two sets S1, S2, the Web is an ideal source as it is large, free and available (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ The Web is immense, free, and available by mouse click.

It is natural to question the appropriateness of web data for research purposes, because web data is inevitably noisy and search engines themselves can introduce certain idiosyncracies which can distort results (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ However, for some purposes, it is not large enough.

The second corpus is a subset of the German part of the Wacky project (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ The problem with the second is that it is arbitrary.

So we have the Internet $$$$$ The Web is immense, free, and available by mouse click.
So we have the Internet $$$$$ It contains hundreds of billions of words of text and can be used for all manner of language research.

Many NLP tasks have successfully utilized very large corpora, most of which were acquired from the Web (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ In October 1996 there How can these large numbers be used for other language-processing tasks?
Many NLP tasks have successfully utilized very large corpora, most of which were acquired from the Web (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003). $$$$$ They find that Web frequency counts are consistent with those for other large corpora.
