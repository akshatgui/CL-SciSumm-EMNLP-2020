 $$$$$ Among these, 1,200 Chinese and 4,500 English documents are manually marked as being in-topic.
 $$$$$ For example, methods for learning a classifier to determine sentence parallel-ness such as that proposed by Munteanu et al., (2004) can be incorporated into our Bootstrapping framework.

We base our candidate generation on a method that Fung and Cheung (2004) developed for extracting loose translations (comparable sentence pairs) from quasi-comparable corpora [9], as shown in Figure 2. $$$$$ We present a method capable of extracting parallel sentences from far more disparate “very-non-parallel corpora” than previous “comparable corpora” methods, by exploiting bootstrapping on top of IBM Model 4 EM.
We base our candidate generation on a method that Fung and Cheung (2004) developed for extracting loose translations (comparable sentence pairs) from quasi-comparable corpora [9], as shown in Figure 2. $$$$$ Previous work on extracting bilingual or monolingual sentence pairs from comparable corpora has only been applied to documents that are within the same topic, or have very similar publication dates.

However, we can understand the improvement by comparing against scores obtained using the cosine-based lexical similarity metric which is typical of the majority of previous methods for mining non-parallel corpora, including that of Fung and Cheung (2004) [9]. $$$$$ Mining Very-Non-Parallel Corpora

Fung and Cheung (2004) approach the problem by using a cosine similarity measure to match foreign and English documents. $$$$$ They all use lexical information (e.g. word overlap, cosine similarity) to match documents first, before extracting sentences from these documents.
Fung and Cheung (2004) approach the problem by using a cosine similarity measure to match foreign and English documents. $$$$$ The aim of this step is to roughly match the Chinese-English documents pairs that have the same topic, in order to extract parallel sentences from them.

The degree of parallelism can vary greatly, ranging from noisy parallel documents that contain many parallel sentences, to quasi parallel documents that may cover different topics (Fung and Cheung, 2004). $$$$$ In this paper, we contrast and analyze different bilingual corpora, ranging from the parallel, noisy parallel, comparable, to very-non-parallel corpora.
The degree of parallelism can vary greatly, ranging from noisy parallel documents that contain many parallel sentences, to quasi parallel documents that may cover different topics (Fung and Cheung, 2004). $$$$$ The ”documents” here are sentences.

Sample comparable sentences that contain parallel phrases other similarity measures (Fung and Cheung, 2004) have been used for the document alignment task. $$$$$ For comparable corpora, the alignment principle made in previous work is as follows

Based on this observation, dynamic program ming (Yang and Li, 2003), similarity measures such as Cosine (Fung and Cheung, 2004) or word and translation error ratios (Abdul-Rauf and Schwenk, 2009), or maximum entropy classifier (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) are used for discovering parallel sentences. $$$$$ Recent work (Munteanu et al., 2004, Zhao and Vogel, 2002) on extracting parallel sentences from comparable data, and others on extracting paraphrasing sentences from monolingual corpora (Barzilay and Elhadad 2003) are based on the “find-topic-extract-sentence” principle which claims that parallel sentences only exist in document pairs with high similarity.

Another approach focused on sentence extraction (Fung and Cheung, 2004). $$$$$ Mining Very-Non-Parallel Corpora

A web interface was developed in order to annotate each pair, following the distinction introduced by Fung and Cheung (2004) $$$$$ Since many more multilingual texts available today contain documents that do not have matching documents in the other language, we propose finding more parallel sentences from off-topic documents, as well as on-topic documents.

We would like to stress that, while conducting the manual annotation, we frequently found difficult to label pairs of articles with the classes proposed by Fung and Cheung (2004). $$$$$ Munteanu et al., (2004) used news articles published within the same 5-day window.

The last case study of document and sentence alignment from ―very-non-parallel corpora is the work from Fung and Cheung (2004). $$$$$ In our work, we try to find parallel sentences from far more disparate, very-non-parallel corpora than in any previous work.

Fung and Cheung (2004a) describe corpora ranging from noisy parallel, to comparable, and finally to very non-parallel. $$$$$ In this paper, we contrast and analyze different bilingual corpora, ranging from the parallel, noisy parallel, comparable, to very-non-parallel corpora.
