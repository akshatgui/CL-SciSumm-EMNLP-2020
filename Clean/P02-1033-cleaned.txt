This assumption of similar meaning when multiple phrases map onto a single foreign language phrase is the converse of the assumption made in the word sense disambiguation work of Diab and Resnik (2002) which posits different word senses when a single English word maps onto different words in the foreign language. $$$$$ A word that has multiple senses in one language is often translated as distinct words in another language, with the particular choice depending ort the translator and the contextualized meaning; thus the corresponding translation can be thought of as a sense indicator for the instance of the word in its context.

In order to accomplish these steps, Bhattacharya et al (2004) used the pseudo-translation approach of Diab and Resnik (2002): they created the model using an English-Spanish parallel corpus constructed by using Systran to translate a large collection of English text, and they obtained parallel Spanish text for the test items in the same fashion. $$$$$ A suitably large English corpus is constructed, containing as a subset an English corpus for which we have art existing set of associated gold-standard sense tags.
