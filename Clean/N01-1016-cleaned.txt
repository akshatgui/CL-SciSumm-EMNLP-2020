Work in statistically parsing conversational speech (Charniak and Johnson, 2001) has examined the performance of a parser that removes edit regions in an earlier step. $$$$$ We present a simple architecture for parsing transcribed speech in which an edited-word detector first removes such words from the sentence string, and then a standard statistical parser trained on transcribed speech parses the remaining words.

A study by Charniak and Johnson (2001) shows that one can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 Precision and 67 recall. $$$$$ Edit Detection And Parsing For Transcribed Speech
A study by Charniak and Johnson (2001) shows that one can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 Precision and 67 recall. $$$$$ Then precision = C/M and recall = C/N.

Readability studies have shown that disfluencies (fillers and speech repairs) may be deleted from transcripts without compromising meaning (Jones et al, 2003), and deleting repairs prior to parsing has been shown to improve its accuracy (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Note that of the major problems associated with transcribed speech, we choose to deal with only one of them, speech repairs, in a special fashion.

Earlier work had already made this claim regarding speech repairs and argued that there was consequently little value in syntactically analyzing repairs or evaluating our ability to do so (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ The comparative neglect of speech (or transcribed speech) is understandable, since parsing transcribed speech presents several problems absent in regular text: “um”s and “ah”s (or more formally, filled pauses), frequent use of parentheticals (e.g., “you know”), ungrammatical constructions, and speech repairs (e.g., “Why didn’t he, why didn’t she stay home?”).

Our division of the corpus follows that used in (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ The organization of this paper follows the architecture just described.

These steps result in an improvement of 43.98% percent relative error reduction in F-score over an earlier best result in edited detection when punctuation is included in both training and testing data [Charniak and Johnson 2001]. $$$$$ For example, ungrammaticality in some sense is relative, so if the training corpus contains the same kind of ungrammatical examples as the testing corpus, one would not expect ungrammaticality itself to be a show stopper.

We include the distributions with punctuation is to match with the baseline system reported in [Charniak and Johnson 2001], where punctuation is included to identify the edited regions. $$$$$ Punctuation is ignored for the purposes of defining a rough copy, although conditioning variables indicate whether the rough copy includes punctuation.

We take as our baseline system the work by [Charniak and Johnson 2001]. $$$$$ We compare these results to a baseline “null” classifier, which never identifies a word as EDITED.

In the rest of the section, we first briefly introduce the boosting algorithm, then describe the method used in [Charniak and Johnson 2001], and finally we contrast our improvements with the baseline system. $$$$$ Our boosting classifier is directly based on the greedy boosting algorithm described by Collins [7].

In [Charniak and Johnson 2001], identifying edited regions is considered as a classification problem, where each word is classified either as edited or normal. $$$$$ This method treats the problem of identifying EDITED nodes as a word-token classification problem, where each word token is classified as either edited or not.

We relax the definition for rough copy, because more than 94% of all edits have both reparandum and repair, while the rough copy defined in [Charniak and Johnson 2001] only covers 77.66% of such instances. $$$$$ Many of the variables are defined in terms of what we call a rough copy.

Edit disfluency detection systems that rely exclusively on word-based information have been presented by Heeman et al (Heeman et al, 1996) and Charniak and Johnson (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Edit Detection And Parsing For Transcribed Speech
Edit disfluency detection systems that rely exclusively on word-based information have been presented by Heeman et al (Heeman et al, 1996) and Charniak and Johnson (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Undoubtedly the work closest to ours is that of Stolcke et al. [18], which also uses the transcribed Switchboard corpus.

Based on the convention from Shriberg (1994) and Charniak and Johnson (2001), a disfluent spoken utterance is divided into three parts: the reparandum, the part that is repaired; the interregnum, which can be filler words or empty; and the repair/repeat, the part that replaces or repeats the reparandum. $$$$$ This architecture is based upon a fundamental assumption: that the semantic and pragmatic content of an utterance is based solely on the unedited words in the word sequence.

Charniak and Johnson (2001) and Kahn et al (2005) have shown that improved edit region identification leads to better parsing accuracy they observe a relative reduction in parsing f-score error of 14% (2% absolute) between automatic and oracle edit removal. $$$$$ Edit Detection And Parsing For Transcribed Speech
