Work in statistically parsing conversational speech (Charniak and Johnson, 2001) has examined the performance of a parser that removes edit regions in an earlier step. $$$$$ We present a simple architecture for parsing transcribed speech in which an edited-word detector first removes such words from the sentence string, and then a standard statistical parser trained on transcribed speech parses the remaining words.

A study by Charniak and Johnson (2001) shows that one can identify and remove edits from transcribed conversational speech with an F-score of about 78, with roughly 95 Precision and 67 recall. $$$$$ Edit Detection And Parsing For Transcribed Speech

Readability studies have shown that disfluencies (fillers and speech repairs) may be deleted from transcripts without compromising meaning (Jones et al, 2003), and deleting repairs prior to parsing has been shown to improve its accuracy (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ Note that of the major problems associated with transcribed speech, we choose to deal with only one of them, speech repairs, in a special fashion.
Readability studies have shown that disfluencies (fillers and speech repairs) may be deleted from transcripts without compromising meaning (Jones et al, 2003), and deleting repairs prior to parsing has been shown to improve its accuracy (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ The Switchboard corpus annotates disfluencies such as restarts and repairs using the terminology of Shriberg [15].

Earlier work had already made this claim regarding speech repairs and argued that there was consequently little value in syntactically analyzing repairs or evaluating our ability to do so (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ The comparative neglect of speech (or transcribed speech) is understandable, since parsing transcribed speech presents several problems absent in regular text

Our division of the corpus follows that used in (Charniak and Johnson, 2001). $$$$$ The organization of this paper follows the architecture just described.

These steps result in an improvement of 43.98% percent relative error reduction in F-score over an earlier best result in edited detection when punctuation is included in both training and testing data [Charniak and Johnson 2001]. $$$$$ For example, ungrammaticality in some sense is relative, so if the training corpus contains the same kind of ungrammatical examples as the testing corpus, one would not expect ungrammaticality itself to be a show stopper.

In the rest of the section, we first briefly introduce the boosting algorithm, then describe the method used in [Charniak and Johnson 2001], and finally we contrast our improvements with the baseline system. $$$$$ Our boosting classifier is directly based on the greedy boosting algorithm described by Collins [7].

In [Charniak and Johnson 2001], identifying edited regions is considered as a classification problem, where each word is classified either as edited or normal. $$$$$ This method treats the problem of identifying EDITED nodes as a word-token classification problem, where each word token is classified as either edited or not.

We relax the definition for rough copy, because more than 94% of all edits have both reparandum and repair, while the rough copy defined in [Charniak and Johnson 2001] only covers 77.66% of such instances. $$$$$ Many of the variables are defined in terms of what we call a rough copy.
