Extending on the notion of a Base NP, introduced by Collins (1996), we mark any nonterminal that dominates only preterminals as Base. $$$$$ VBD is identified as the head-child of VP —> <VBD NP NP>.
Extending on the notion of a Base NP, introduced by Collins (1996), we mark any nonterminal that dominates only preterminals as Base. $$$$$ The triple of nonterminals at the start, middle and end of the arrow specify the nature of the dependency relationship — <NP , S , VP> represents a subject-verb dependency, <PP ,NP ,NP> denotes prepositional phrase modification of an NP, and so on4.

For the discourse structure analysis, we suggest a statistical model with discourse segment boundaries (DSBs) similar to the idea of gaps suggested for a statistical parsing (Collins (1996)). $$$$$ First, the statistical model assigns a probability to every candidate parse tree for a sentence.

It is therefore necessary to either discard infrequent rules, do manual editing, use a different rule format such as individual dependencies (Collins, 1996) or gain full linguistic control and insight by using a hand written grammar, each of which sacrifices total completeness. $$$$$ In this way it is similar to 'By 'modifier' we mean the linguistic notion of either an argument or adjunct.

To generate the training examples forthe classifier, we generate a parse tree for every sentence in the SENSEVAL-3 training data, using the Collins (1996) statistical parser. $$$$$ The parse tree in training data indicates a relationship in only one of these cases, so this sentence would contribute an estimate of that the two words are related.

This is a modified version of the backed-off smoothing used by Collins (1996) to alleviate sparse data problems. $$$$$ Conditioning on the exact distance between two words by making Aj,h, = hj — j leads to severe sparse data problems.

We generate our training data from the Wall Street Journal Section of the Penn Tree Bank (PTB), by transforming it to projective dependency structures, following (Collins, 1996), and extracting rules from the result. $$$$$ This paper describes a new parser which is much simpler than SPATTER, yet performs at least as well when trained and tested on the same Wall Street Journal data.
