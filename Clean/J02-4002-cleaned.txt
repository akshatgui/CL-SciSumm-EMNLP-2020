Our methodology builds and extends the Teufel and Moens (Teufel and Moens, 2002) approach to automatic summarisation. $$$$$ We now describe an automatic system that can perform extraction and classification of rhetorical status on unseen text (cf. also a prior version of the system reported in Teufel and Moens [2000] and Teufel [1999]).

It is also similar conceptually to content selection algorithms that have been used for text summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2002) and text generation (Sauper and Barzilay, 2009), both of which rely on finding highly-relevant passages within source texts. $$$$$ We propose in this article a method for sentence and content selection from source texts that adds context in the form of information about the rhetorical role the extracted material plays in the source text.

This approach to summarization was inspired by the process described in (Teufel and Moens, 2002).

Ultimately, human supervision may be required as in Teufel and Moens (2002), however we can make some observations about the automatic annotation methods above. $$$$$ The annotation experiment described here (and in Teufel, Carletta, and Moens [1999] in more detail) tests the rhetorical annotation scheme presented in section 2.4.

In earlier work, (Teufel and Moens, 2002) have examined the problem of summarizing scientific articles using rhetorical analysis of sentences. $$$$$ Summarizing Scientific Articles

For instance, Teufel and Moens (2002) summarize scientific articles by selecting rhetorical elements that are commonly present in scientific abstracts. $$$$$ Another persistently problematic distinction for our annotators was that between OWN Teufel and Moens Summarizing Scientific Articles and BACKGROUND.

Previous work on rhetorical analysis of scientific articles focus on either; 1) hierarchical discourse relations between sentences (e.g. Mann and Thompson, 1987), 2) genre analysis within a descriptive framework (e.g. Swales 1990), or 3) ZI in a flat structure and a statistical evaluation of the annotation scheme from a machine learning perspective (e.g. Teufel and Moens, 2002). $$$$$ Our rhetorical analysis, as noted above, is nonhierarchical, in contrast to Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987; Marcu 1999), and it concerns text pieces at a lower level of granularity.

As these schemes are too fine grained for abstracts (some of the categories do not appear in abstracts at all), we adopt a reduced version of AZ which integrates seven categories from (Teufel and Moens, 2002) and (Mizuta et al, 2005) those which actually appear in abstracts. $$$$$ Even though the sequence AIMâ€“OWN is very common (contained in 73% of all abstracts), the 80 abstracts still contain 40 different rhetorical sequences, 28 of which are unique.
