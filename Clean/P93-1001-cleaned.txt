The program takes the output of char_align (Church, 1993), a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs, and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown el al.'s Model 2 (Brown et al, 1993), modified and extended to deal with robustness issues. $$$$$ have been a number of recent papers on aligning parallel texts at the sentence level, e.g., Brown al and Church (to appear), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rosenschein (to appear), Simard al Warwick— Armstrong and Russell (1990).

 $$$$$ Char_align has succeeded in meeting many of these goals because it works at the character level and does not depend on finding sentence and/or paragraph boundaries which are surprisingly elusive in realistic applications.

The work by Simard, Foster and Isabelle (1993) as well as Church (1993) demonstrated that cognate-matching strategies can be highly effective in aligning text. $$$$$ have been a number of recent papers on aligning parallel texts at the sentence level, e.g., Brown al and Church (to appear), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rosenschein (to appear), Simard al Warwick— Armstrong and Russell (1990).

Church (1993) uses 4-grams at the level of character sequences. $$$$$ Char Align: A Program For Aligning Parallel Texts At The Character Level
Church (1993) uses 4-grams at the level of character sequences. $$$$$ The resulting program, char_align, works at the character level using an approach inspired by the cognate method proposed in Simard et al (1992).

Using lexical information, Kenneth Church (1993) showed that cheap alignment of text segments was still possible exploiting orthographic cognates (Michel Simard et al, 1992), instead of sentence delimiters. $$$$$ have been a number of recent papers on aligning parallel texts at the sentence level, e.g., Brown al and Church (to appear), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rosenschein (to appear), Simard al Warwick— Armstrong and Russell (1990).

We use the text Dotplotting representation by (Church, 1993) and plot the cosine similarity scores between every pair of sentences in the text. $$$$$ Figure 4 illustrates this use of the residuals for the European Parliamentary text presented in Figure 1.
We use the text Dotplotting representation by (Church, 1993) and plot the cosine similarity scores between every pair of sentences in the text. $$$$$ The upper—left quadrant and the lower—right quadrant are darker than the other two quadrants because the source text and the target text are more themselves than either is like the other.

Simard and Plamondon (Simard and Plamondon, 1998) used a composite method in which the first pass does alignment at the level of characters asin (Church, 1993) (itself based on cognate matching) and the second pass uses IBM Model-1, following Chen (Chen, 1993). $$$$$ This paper describes a new program, aligns texts at the level rather than at the sentence/paragraph level, based on the cognate approach proposed by Simard al.

In previous work (Church et al 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using char align (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target. $$$$$ Char Align: A Program For Aligning Parallel Texts At The Character Level
In previous work (Church et al 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using char align (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target. $$$$$ We have found that it can even work on some texts in English and Japanese such as the AWK manual, because many of the technical terms (e.g., awk, BEGIN, END, getline, print, printf) are the same in both texts.

Currently ,word_align depends on char align (Church, 1993) to generate a starting point, which limits its applicability to European languages since char_align was designed for language pairs that share a common alphabet. $$$$$ This is especially true for historically related language pairs such as English and French, which share quite a number of cognates, e.g., government and gouvernement, though it also holds fairly well for almost any language pair that makes use of the Roman alphabet since there will usually be a fair number of proper nouns (e.g., surnames, company names, place names) and numbers (e.g., dates, times) that will be nearly the same in the two texts.

Church (1993) observes that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bi text obtained from an OCR device is quite difficult. $$$$$ Unfortunately, if the input is noisy (due to OCR and/or unknown markup conventions), then these methods tend to break down because the noise can make it difficult to find boundaries, let alone sentences.
Church (1993) observes that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bi text obtained from an OCR device is quite difficult. $$$$$ We have found it so difficult to find paragraph boundaries in texts that have been OCRed that we have decided to abandon the paragraph/sentence approach.

Levenshtein measure (Levenshtein, 1966) Church (1993) employs a method that induces sentence alignment by employing cognates (words that are spelled similarly across languages). $$$$$ Figure 8 shows a dotplot of 3 years of Canadian Hansards (37 million words) in English and French, tokenized by words.
Levenshtein measure (Levenshtein, 1966) Church (1993) employs a method that induces sentence alignment by employing cognates (words that are spelled similarly across languages). $$$$$ Thus, low frequency tokens (e.g., content words) contribute more to the dotplot than high frequency tokens (e.g., function words).
