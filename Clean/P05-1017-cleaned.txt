Hashimoto et al's method constructs a network of templates based on their co-occurrence in web sentences with a small number of polarity-assigned seed templates and infers the polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint solver based on the spin model (Takamura et al, 2005). $$$$$ We call this network the gloss network (G).

Takamura et al (2005) determine term orientation (for Japanese) according to a spin model, i.e. a physical model of a set of electrons each endowed with one between two possible spin directions, and where electrons propagate their spin direction to neighbouring electrons until the system reaches a stable configuration. $$$$$ For this purpose, we use spin model, which is a model for a set of electrons with spins.
