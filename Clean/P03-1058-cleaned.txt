To tackle this problem, in one of our recent work (Ng et al, 2003), we had gathered training data from parallel texts and obtained encouraging results in our evaluation on the nouns of SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task (Kilgarriff, 2001). $$$$$ We evaluated our approach on all the nouns in the English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001; Kilgarriff 2001), which used the WordNet 1.7 sense inventory (Miller, 1990).

To gather training examples from these parallel texts, we used the approach we described in (Ng et al, 2003) and (Chan and Ng, 2005b). $$$$$ We then used our approach of parallel text alignment described in the last section to obtain the training examples from the English side of the parallel texts.
To gather training examples from these parallel texts, we used the approach we described in (Ng et al, 2003) and (Chan and Ng, 2005b). $$$$$ If there are insufficient training examples for some sense of w from the parallel texts, then we just used as many parallel text training examples as we could find for that sense.

Other similar work includes that in (Ng et al, 2003), where a sense-annotated corpus was automatically generated from a parallel corpus. $$$$$ This annotated corpus then serves as the training material for a learning algorithm.

For example, Ng et al (2003) acquired sense examples using English-Chinese parallel corpora, which were manually or automatically aligned at sentence level and then word-aligned using software. $$$$$ In this step, parallel texts are first sentence-aligned and then word-aligned.

There is a growing number of methods that use data available in one language to build text processing tools for another language, for diverse tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Ng et al, 2003), syntactic parsing (Hwa et al, 2005), information retrieval (Monz and Dorr, 2005), subjectivity analysis (Mihalcea et al, 2007), and others. $$$$$ It is a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP), and the ability to disambiguate word sense accurately is important for applications like machine translation, information retrieval, etc.

For the translation of ambiguous English words Ng et al (2003) made use of the fact that the various senses are often translated differently. $$$$$ For the 7 nouns that are lumped into one sense (i.e., they are all translated into one Chinese word), we do not perform WSD on these words.

Similarly, (Ng et al, 2003) report a research study which uses an English-Chinese parallel corpus in order to extract sense-tagged training data. $$$$$ In this paper, we address the above issues and report our findings, exploiting the English-Chinese parallel corpora in Table 2 for word sense disambiguation.

 $$$$$ We rely on two sources to decide on the sense classes of w: (i) The sense definitions in WordNet 1.7, which lists seven senses for the noun channel.

Ng et al (2003) address word sense disambiguation by manually annotating WordNet senses with their translation in the target language (Chinese), and then automatically extracting labeled examples for word sense disambiguation by applying the IBM Models to a bilingual corpus. $$$$$ Given a word-aligned parallel corpus, the different translations in a target language serve as the “sense-tags” of an ambiguous word in the source language.

Moreover, some studies present multilingual WSD systems that attain state-of-the-art performance in all-words disambiguation (Ng et al, 2003). $$$$$ Our previous research demonstrated that such an approach leads to a state-of-the-art WSD program with good performance.

Ng et al (2003) extend this approach further and demonstrate that it is feasible for large scale WSD. $$$$$ The lack of large-scale parallel corpora no doubt has impeded progress in this direction, although attempts have been made to mine parallel corpora from the Web (Resnik, 1999).

Unlike Ng et al (2003) our algorithm works on monolingual corpora, which are much more abundant than parallel ones, and is fully automatic. $$$$$ The parallel text alignment approach works well for nature and sense, among these nouns.

As described in (Ng et al, 2003), when several senses of an English word are translated by the same Chinese word, we can collapse these senses to obtain a coarser-grained, lumped sense inventory. $$$$$ Two senses are lumped together if they are translated in the same way in Chinese.
