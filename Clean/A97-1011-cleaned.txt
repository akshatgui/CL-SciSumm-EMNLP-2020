To identify associative constructions, we first process our texts using Conexor's FDG parser (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997). $$$$$ The ENGCG results compare to those reported elsewhere (Jirvinen, 1994; Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1994).
To identify associative constructions, we first process our texts using Conexor's FDG parser (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997). $$$$$ We are using Atro Voutilainen's (1995) improved part-of-speech disambiguation grammar which runs in the CG-2 parser.

For English texts, these trees were first provided by the Connexor parser at UMIACS (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997), and then corrected by one of the team PIs. $$$$$ The parser corresponds to over three man-years of work, which does not include the lexical analyser and the morphological disambiguator, both parts of the existing English Constraint Grammar parser (Karlsson et al., 1995).

It is developped at the Xerox Research Centre Europe (XRCE) and shares the same computationnal paradigm as the PNLPL approach (Jensen, 1992) and the FDGP approach (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997). $$$$$ In essence, the same formalism is used in the syntactic analysis in Jarvinen (1994) and Anttila (1995).
