The most clearly relevant study is Light et al (2004) where the focus is on introducing the problem, exploring annotation issues and outlining potential applications rather than on the specificities of the ML approach, though they do present some results using a manually crafted substring matching classifier and a supervised SVM on a collection of Medline abstracts. $$$$$ For example a human language technology workshop will be held this Spring entitled “Exploring Attitude and Affect in Text

To further elucidate the nature of the task and improve annotation consistency, we have developed a new set of guidelines, building on the work of Light et al (2004). $$$$$ Thus, we present a large number of examples to elucidate the variety and nature of the phenomena.

Previous studies (Light et al, 2004) showed that the detection of hedging can be solved effectively by looking for specific keywords which imply that the content of a sentence is speculative and constructing simple expert rules that describe the circumstances of where and how a key word should appear. $$$$$ For example, (Friedman et al., 1994) discusses uncertainty and hedging in radiology reports and their system assigns one of five levels of certainty to extracted findings.

Results obtained adding external dictionaries In our final model we added the keywords used in (Light et al, 2004) and those gathered for our ICD 9-CM hedge detection module. $$$$$ In fact the final sentence contains a speculation more often than not.

Baseline 1 denotes the substring matching system of Light et al (Light et al, 2004) and Baseline 2de notes the system of Medlock and Briscoe (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007). $$$$$ Another baseline option is to use a set of strings and look for them as substrings in the sentences.

For clinical free texts, Baseline 1 is an out-domain model since the keywords were collected for scientific texts by (Light et al, 2004) . $$$$$ This research focuses on newswire texts and other texts on the topic of politics and current events.

Our finding that token unigram features are capable of solving the task accurately agrees with the the results of previous work son hedge classification ((Light et al, 2004), (Med 287 lock and Briscoe, 2007)), and we argue that 2-3 word-long phrases also play an important role as hedge cues and as non-speculative uses of an otherwise speculative keyword as well (i.e. to resolve an ambiguity). $$$$$ Differentiating between speculative and definite statements is one part of finding such statement pairs.

In general, these studies focus on issues regarding annotating speculation and approach the problem of recognizing speculation as a text classification problem, using the well-known bag of words method (Light et al 2004, Medlock and Briscoe, 2007) or simple substring matching (Light et al, 2004). $$$$$ If we assume a default strategy as a simple baseline, where the majority decision is always made, then we get an accuracy of 82% for the classification problem on the last two sentences data set and 89% for the all sentences data set.

For example, on line product and movie reviews have provided a rich context for analyzing sentiments and opinions in text (see Pang and Lee (2008) for a recent survey), while tentative, speculative nature of scientific writing, particularly in biomedical literature, has provided impetus for recent research in speculation detection (Light et al, 2004). $$$$$ The PubMed identifier is provided following each sentence.

And as we expected, the feature that represents whether the word is in the hedge list or not is very useful especially in hedge cue finding, indicating that methods based on a hedge cue lists (Light et al, 2004) or keyword selection (Szarvas, 2008) are quite significant way to accomplish such tasks. $$$$$ In addition, an experiment with automated methods also suggest that reliable automated methods might also be developed.

Light et al (2004) started to do annotations on biomedicine article abstracts, and conducted the preliminary work of automatic classification for uncertainty. $$$$$ The gene regulation annotations marked by Light (sets a & b using only Light’s annotations) can be used to answer questions about the position of speculative fragments in abstracts.
