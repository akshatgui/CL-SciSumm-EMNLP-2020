The most clearly relevant study is Light et al (2004) where the focus is on introducing the problem, exploring annotation issues and outlining potential applications rather than on the specificities of the ML approach, though they do present some results using a manually crafted substring matching classifier and a supervised SVM on a collection of Medline abstracts. $$$$$ For example a human language technology workshop will be held this Spring entitled “Exploring Attitude and Affect in Text: Theories and Applications.” (Qu et al., 2004).

To further elucidate the nature of the task and improve annotation consistency, we have developed a new set of guidelines, building on the work of Light et al (2004). $$$$$ Thus, we present a large number of examples to elucidate the variety and nature of the phenomena.

As a baseline classifier we use the substring matching technique of (Light et al, 2004), which labels a sentence as spec if it contains one or more of the following: suggest, potential, likely, may, at least, in part ,possibl, further investigation, unlikely ,putative, insights, point toward, promise and propose. $$$$$ A definite sentence contains no speculative fragments.

Previous studies (Light et al, 2004) showed that the detection of hedging can be solved effectively by looking for specific keywords which imply that the content of a sentence is speculative and constructing simple expert rules that describe the circumstances of where and how a key word should appear. $$$$$ For example, (Friedman et al., 1994) discusses uncertainty and hedging in radiology reports and their system assigns one of five levels of certainty to extracted findings.

Results obtained adding external dictionaries In our final model we added the keywords used in (Light et al, 2004) and those gathered for our ICD 9-CM hedge detection module. $$$$$ In fact the final sentence contains a speculation more often than not.

Baseline 1 denotes the substring matching system of Light et al (Light et al, 2004) and Baseline 2de notes the system of Medlock and Briscoe (Medlock and Briscoe, 2007). $$$$$ Another baseline option is to use a set of strings and look for them as substrings in the sentences.

For clinical free texts, Baseline 1 is an out-domain model since the keywords were collected for scientific texts by (Light et al, 2004) . $$$$$ This research focuses on newswire texts and other texts on the topic of politics and current events.

Our finding that token unigram features are capable of solving the task accurately agrees with the the results of previous work son hedge classification ((Light et al, 2004), (Med 287 lock and Briscoe, 2007)), and we argue that 2-3 word-long phrases also play an important role as hedge cues and as non-speculative uses of an otherwise speculative keyword as well (i.e. to resolve an ambiguity). $$$$$ Differentiating between speculative and definite statements is one part of finding such statement pairs.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the speculative aspect of biomedical language (Light et al, 2004, Wilbur et al, 2006, Medlock and Briscoe, 2007). $$$$$ For example a human language technology workshop will be held this Spring entitled “Exploring Attitude and Affect in Text: Theories and Applications.” (Qu et al., 2004).

In general, these studies focus on issues regarding annotating speculation and approach the problem of recognizing speculation as a text classification problem, using the well-known bag of words method (Light et al 2004, Medlock and Briscoe, 2007) or simple substring matching (Light et al, 2004). $$$$$ If we assume a default strategy as a simple baseline, where the majority decision is always made, then we get an accuracy of 82% for the classification problem on the last two sentences data set and 89% for the all sentences data set.

Light et al (2004) report low inter-annotator agreement in distinguishing low speculative sentences from highly speculative ones. $$$$$ In this experiment, four human annotators manually marked sentences as highly speculative, low speculative, or definite.
Light et al (2004) report low inter-annotator agreement in distinguishing low speculative sentences from highly speculative ones. $$$$$ Some of the questions we hoped to answer with this experiment were: can we characterize what a speculative sentence is (as demonstrated by good inter-annotator agreement), can a distinction between high and low speculation be made, how much speculative speech is there, where are speculative sentences located in the abstract, is there variation across topics?

First, we used the substring matching method reported in Light et al (2004), which labels sentences containing one of more of the following as speculative: suggest, potential, likely, may, at least ,inpart ,possibl, further investigation, unlikely ,putative, insights, point toward, promise and propose (Baseline1). $$$$$ The substring method was run on a subset of the datasets where the gene regulation data (sets a&b) was removed.

For example, on line product and movie reviews have provided a rich context for analyzing sentiments and opinions in text (see Pang and Lee (2008) for a recent survey), while tentative, speculative nature of scientific writing, particularly in biomedical literature, has provided impetus for recent research in speculation detection (Light et al, 2004). $$$$$ The PubMed identifier is provided following each sentence.

The overall inter-annotator agreement was = 0.65, which is similar to what Light et al (2004) report but worse than Medlock and Briscoe' s (2007) results. $$$$$ Our inter-annotator agreement results are expressed in the following four tables.

And as we expected, the feature that represents whether the word is in the hedge list or not is very useful especially in hedge cue finding, indicating that methods based on a hedge cue lists (Light et al, 2004) or keyword selection (Szarvas, 2008) are quite significant way to accomplish such tasks. $$$$$ In addition, an experiment with automated methods also suggest that reliable automated methods might also be developed.

Light et al (2004) started to do annotations on biomedicine article abstracts, and conducted the preliminary work of automatic classification for uncertainty. $$$$$ The gene regulation annotations marked by Light (sets a & b using only Light’s annotations) can be used to answer questions about the position of speculative fragments in abstracts.
