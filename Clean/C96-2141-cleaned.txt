They model operations that are meaningful at a syntax level, like re-ordering children, but ignore features that have proven useful in IBM models, such as the preference to align words with similar positions, and the HMM preference for links to appear near one another (Vogel et al, 1996). $$$$$ In the recent years, there have been a number of papers con- sidering this or similar problems

Over the years, there have been many proposals to improve these reordering models, most notably Vogel et al (1996), which adds a first-order dependency. $$$$$ In the recent years, there have been a number of papers con- sidering this or similar problems

Generative word alignment models including IBM models (Brown et al, 1993) and HMM word alignment models (Vogel et al, 1996) have been widely used in various types of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. $$$$$ HMM-Based Word Alignment In Statistical Translation

Because such approaches directly learn a generative model over phrase pairs, they are theoretically preferable to the standard heuristics for extracting the phrase pairs from the many-to-one word-level alignments produced by the IBM series models (Brown et al, 1993) or the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Vogel et al,1996). $$$$$ In the recent years, there have been a number of papers con- sidering this or similar problems

Starting with the IBM models (Brown et al,1993), researchers have developed various statistical word alignment systems based on different models, such as hidden Markov models (HMM) (Vogel et al, 1996), log-linear models (OchandNey, 2003), and similarity-based heuristic methods (Melamed, 2000). $$$$$ HMM-Based Word Alignment In Statistical Translation

While classical approaches for word alignment are based on generative models (e.g., IBM models (Brown et al, 1993) and HMM (Vogel et al, 1996)), word alignment can also be viewed as a matching problem, where each word pair is associated with a score reflecting the desirability of aligning that pair, and the alignment is then the highest scored matching under some constraints. $$$$$ HMM-Based Word Alignment In Statistical Translation
