In (Schabes, 1992) it is proposed to infer a stochastic TAG from a large training corpus using an inside-outside-like iterative algorithm. $$$$$ We compare the results of the TAG inside-outside algorithm with the results of the inside-outside algorithm for context-free grammars (Baker, 1979).

In (Pereira and Schabes, 1992), 90.36% bracketing accuracy was reported using a stochastic CFG trained on bracketings from the ATIS corpus. $$$$$ The latter property is important as we would like to be able to use bracketing information in the ilL- put corpus as in (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).

Our general estimation method also has practical applications in cases one uses a probabilistic context-free grammar to approximate strictly more powerful rewriting systems, as for instance probabilistic tree adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992). $$$$$ Probabilistic representation f formal languages.

In recent years, the statistical parsing community has begun to reach out; for syntactic formalisms that recognize the individuality of words, link grammars (Sleator and &apos; Pemperley, 1991) and lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992) have now received stochastic treatments. $$$$$ Stochastic Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammars

Although it is beyond the scope of our research, we conjecture that there exists a Monte Carlo disambiguation algorithm for at least Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Schabes, 1992). $$$$$ Stochastic Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammars

Examples of the first approach can be seen most clearly with the usage of CNF grammars by the Inside-Outside algorithm (Pereira and Schabes, 1992, Lari and Young, 1990). $$$$$ We compare the results of the TAG inside-outside algorithm with the results of the inside-outside algorithm for context-free grammars (Baker, 1979).
