Following Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), the current dominant approach is formulating chunking as a classification task, in which each word is classified as the (B)eginning, (I)nside or (O) outside of a chunk. $$$$$ Voutilainen (1993), in his impressive NPtool system, uses an approach that is in some ways similar to the one used here, in that he adds to his part-of-speech tags a new kind of tag that shows chunk structure; the chunk tag &quot;Â©>N&quot;, for example, is used for determiners and premodifiers, both of which group with the following noun head.
Following Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), the current dominant approach is formulating chunking as a classification task, in which each word is classified as the (B)eginning, (I)nside or (O) outside of a chunk. $$$$$ For example, instead of referring to the word two to the left, a rule pattern could refer to the first word in the current chunk, or the last word of the previous chunk.

NP chunks in the shared task data are BaseNPs, which are non-recursive NPs, a definition first proposed by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995). $$$$$ At about the same time, Ejerhed (1988), working with Church, performed comparisons between finite state methods and Church's stochastic models for identifying both non-recursive clauses and non-recursive NPs in English text.
NP chunks in the shared task data are BaseNPs, which are non-recursive NPs, a definition first proposed by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995). $$$$$ We performed experiments using two different chunk structure targets, one that tried to bracket non-recursive &quot;baseNPs&quot; and one that partitioned sentences into non-overlapping N-type and V-type chunks, loosely following Abney's model.

Transformation-based learning (TBL) was originally introduced via the Brill part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1992) and has since been applied to a wide variety of NLP tasks, including binary phrase structure bracketing (Brill, 1993), PP-attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik, 1994), base NP chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), dialogue act tagging (Samuel et al1998), and named entity re cog nition (Black and Vasilakopoulos, 2002). $$$$$ This technique has previously been used not only for part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1994), but also for prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik, 1994), and assigning unlabeled binary-branching tree structure to sentences (Brill, 1993a).

Many approaches to identifying base noun phrases have been explored as part of chunking (Ramshawand Marcus, 1995), but determining sub-NP structure is rarely addressed. $$$$$ Since chunking includes identifying the non-recursive portions of noun phrases, it can also be useful for other purposes including index term generation.
Many approaches to identifying base noun phrases have been explored as part of chunking (Ramshawand Marcus, 1995), but determining sub-NP structure is rarely addressed. $$$$$ This section discusses how text chunking can be encoded as a tagging problem that can be conveniently addressed using transformational learning.

Ramshaw and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus,1995) first represented base noun phrase recognition as a machine learning problem. $$$$$ Applying transformational learning to text chunking requires that the system's current hypotheses about chunk structure be represented in a way that can be matched against the pattern parts of rules.
Ramshaw and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus,1995) first represented base noun phrase recognition as a machine learning problem. $$$$$ By representing text chunking as a kind of tagging problem, it becomes possible to easily apply transformation-based learning.

Both the IOB representation (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and the Start/End representation (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are popular. $$$$$ Encoding chunk structure with tags attached to words rather than non-recursive bracket markers inserted between words has the advantage that it limits the dependence between different elements of the encoded representation.
Both the IOB representation (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and the Start/End representation (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are popular. $$$$$ In earlier work on transformational part-of-speech tagging (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), we noted that it is possible to greatly speed up the learning process by constructing a full, bidirectional index linking each candidate rule to those locations in the corpus at which it applies and each location in the corpus to those candidate rules that apply there.

Meanwhile, it is common for NP chunking tasks to represent a chunk (e.g., NP) with two labels, the begin (e.g., B-NP) and inside (e.g., I-NP) of a chunk (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). $$$$$ These putative errors, combined with the claimed high performance, suggest that NPtool's definition of NP chunk is also tuned for extracting terminological phrases, and thus excludes many kinds of NP premodifiers, again simplifying the chunking task.

They mention that the resulting shallow parse tags are somewhat different than those used by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), but that they found no significant accuracy differences in training on either set. $$$$$ Since training set size has a significant effect on the results, values are shown for three different training set sizes.

Training and testing were performed using the noun phrase chunking corpus described in Ramshaw & Marcus (1995) (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). $$$$$ Text Chunking Using Transformation-Based Learning

After the work of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), many machine learning techniques have been applied to the basic chunking task, such as Sup port Vector Machines (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), Hidden Markov Model (Molina and Pla 2002), Memory Based Learning (Sang, 2002), Conditional Random Fields (Sha and Pereira, 2003), and so on. $$$$$ Text Chunking Using Transformation-Based Learning

The noun phrase extraction module uses Brill &apos; s POS tagger [Brill (1992)] and a base NPchunker [Ramshaw and Marcus (1995)]. $$$$$ This technique has previously been used not only for part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1994), but also for prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik, 1994), and assigning unlabeled binary-branching tree structure to sentences (Brill, 1993a).

Noun phrases were extracted using Ramshaw and Marcus &apos; s base NPchunker [Ramshaw and Marcus (1995)]. $$$$$ Bourigault claims that the grammar can parse &quot;around 95% of the maximal length noun phrases&quot; in a test corpus into possible terminological phrases, which then require manual validation.
Noun phrases were extracted using Ramshaw and Marcus &apos; s base NPchunker [Ramshaw and Marcus (1995)]. $$$$$ The goal of the &quot;baseNP&quot; chunks was to identify essentially the initial portions of nonrecursive noun phrases up to the head, including determiners but not including postmodifying prepositional phrases or clauses.

Five chunk tag sets, IOB1, IOB2, IOE1, IOE2 (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) and SE (Uchimoto et al, 2000), are commonly used. $$$$$ In this study, training and test sets marked with two different types of chunk structure were derived algorithmically from the parsed data in the Penn Treebank corpus of Wall Street Journal text (Marcus et al., 1994).

Next, a rule-based text chunker (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) is applied on the tagged sentences to further identify phrasal units, such as base noun phrases NP and verbal units VB. $$$$$ The goal of the &quot;baseNP&quot; chunks was to identify essentially the initial portions of nonrecursive noun phrases up to the head, including determiners but not including postmodifying prepositional phrases or clauses.
Next, a rule-based text chunker (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) is applied on the tagged sentences to further identify phrasal units, such as base noun phrases NP and verbal units VB. $$$$$ Rule 3 changes N to BN after a comma (which is tagged P), and in Rule 4, locations tagged BN are switched to BV if the following location is tagged V and has the part-of-speech tag VB.

Given a weight vector w, the scorew? f (x, y) ranks possible labelings of x, and we denote by Yk, w (x) the set of k top scoring labelings for x. We use the standard B, I, O encoding for named entities (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995). $$$$$ In this work, we have found it convenient to do so by encoding the chunking using an additional set of tags, so that each word carries both a part-of-speech tag and also a &quot;chunk tag&quot; from which the chunk structure can be derived.
