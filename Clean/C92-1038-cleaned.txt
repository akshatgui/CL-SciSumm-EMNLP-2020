It would be also interesting to compare our solution with different approaches found in the literature, as for example [Reiter and Dale, 1992] or [Krahmer and Theune, 2000] for the referring expression generation, and the one of Dalianis and Hovy [Dalianis and Hovy, 1996] for the aggregation. $$$$$ The knowledge-representation system should in principle allow different basic-level classes to be specified for different users [Ros78,Rei91].
