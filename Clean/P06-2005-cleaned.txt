This metaphor is, nonetheless, the one resorted to in (Aw et al, 2006), which uses a statistical phrase-based machine translation tool to convert English SMS texts into standardized English. $$$$$ The normalization is visualized as a translation problem where messages in the SMS language are to be translated to normal English using a similar phrase-based statistical MT method (Koehn et al., 2003).

Using this system, (Aw et al, 2006) reports a 0.81 BLEU (Papineni et al, 2001) score on a set of 5,000 English SMS. $$$$$ We use IBM’s BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure the performance of SMS text normalization.

Following (Aw et al, 2006), we found that using off-the-shell statistical MT systems allows to achieve very satisfactory WER; combining this system with a system based on an analogy with the speech recognition problem yields an additional 1.5 absolute improvement in WER. $$$$$ A Phrase-Based Statistical Model For SMS Text Normalization

(Aw et al, 2006) proposed an approach for normalizing Short Messaging Service (SMS) texts by translating it into normalized forms using Phrase-based SMT techniques on character level. $$$$$ Clark (2003) proposed to unify the process of tokenization, segmentation and spelling correction for normalization of general noisy text (rather than SMS or instant messaging texts) based on a noisy channel model at the character level.
(Aw et al, 2006) proposed an approach for normalizing Short Messaging Service (SMS) texts by translating it into normalized forms using Phrase-based SMT techniques on character level. $$$$$ The most significant orthographic variant in SMS texts is in the use of non-standard, selfcreated short-forms.

 $$$$$ In most of the recent works (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata, 2002), they are acquired (semi-) automatically from large comparable or parallel corpora using lexical and morpho-syntactic information.
 $$$$$ A bigger data set will also be used to test the robustness of the system leading to a more accurate alignment and normalization.

Parsing performance on noisy data can be improved by transforming the input data so that it resembles the parser's training data (Aw et al, 2006), transforming the training data so that it resembles the input data (van der Plas et al, 2009), applying semi supervised techniques such as the self-training protocol used by McClosky et al (2006), and changing the parser internals, e.g. adapting the parser's unknown word model to take into account variation in capitalisation and function word misspelling. $$$$$ Bangalore et al. (2002) used a consensus translation technique to bootstrap parallel data using off-the-shelf translation systems for training a hierarchical statistical translation model for general domain instant messaging used in Internet chat rooms.

In the case of text messages, text-to-speech synthesis may be particularly useful for the visually impaired; automatic translation has also been considered (e.g., Aw et al, 2006). $$$$$ General text normalization deals with NonStandard Words (NSWs) and has been wellstudied in text-to-speech (Sproat et al., 2001) while SMS normalization deals with Non-Words (NSs) or lingoes and has seldom been studied before.
