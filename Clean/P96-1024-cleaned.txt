The orthogonal technique of minimum Bayes risk decoding has achieved gains on parsing (Goodman, 1996) and machine translation (Kumar and Byrne, 2004). $$$$$ Consider writing a parser for a domain such as machine assisted translation.

A probability model permits alternative decoding procedures (Goodman, 1996). $$$$$ The entry maxc [1, n] contains the expected number of correct constituents, given the model.
A probability model permits alternative decoding procedures (Goodman, 1996). $$$$$ We have used the technique outlined in this paper in other work (Goodman, 1996) to efficiently parse the DOP model; in that model, the only previously known algorithm which summed over all the possible derivations was a slow Monte Carlo algorithm (Bod, 1993).

These expectations can be easily computed from the inside/outside scores, similarly as in the maximum bracket recall algorithm of Goodman (1996), or in the variational approximation of Matsuzaki et al (2005). $$$$$ The Inside probability is defined as e(s,t, X) = P(X Os) and the Outside probability is f(s,t, X) = P(S 3-1 X n W1 wt-1-1)â€¢ Note that while Baker and others have used these probabilites for inducing grammars, here they are used only for parsing.

Their algorithm is therefore the labelled recall algorithm of Goodman (1996) but applied to rules. $$$$$ Then, in Section 3, we discuss the Labelled Recall Algorithm, a new algorithm that maximizes performance on the Labelled Recall Rate.

The coarse PCFG has an extremely beneficial interaction with the fine all-fragments SDP grammar, wherein the accuracy of the combined grammars is significantly higher than either individually (This is similar to the maximum recall objective for approximate inference (Goodman, 1996b)). $$$$$ Similar counting holds for the other three.

Goodman (1996) observed that the Viterbi parse is in general not the optimal parse for evaluation metrics such as f-score that are based on the number of correct constituents in a parse. $$$$$ The Labelled Recall Algorithm finds that tree TG which has the highest expected value for the Labelled Recall Rate, LINc (where L is the number of correct labelled constituents, and Nc is the number of nodes in the correct parse).

We then compute outside scores for bi spans under a max-sum (Goodman, 1996). $$$$$ Unfortunately, this criterion is relatively difficult to maximize, since it is time-consuming to compute the probability that a particular constituent crosses some constituent in the correct parse.
We then compute outside scores for bi spans under a max-sum (Goodman, 1996). $$$$$ The only required change is that we sum over the symbols X to calculate max_g, rather than maximize over them.
