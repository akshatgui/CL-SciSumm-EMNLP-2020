 $$$$$ For example, consider the following Hebrew sentence, taken from the daily Haaretz, September 1990

It is well known that two languages are more informative than one (Dagan et al, 1991). $$$$$ Two Languages Are More Informative Than One
It is well known that two languages are more informative than one (Dagan et al, 1991). $$$$$ Substantial application of semantic or pragmatic knowledge about the word and its context for broad domains requires compiling huge amounts of knowledge, whose usefulness for practical applications has not yet been proven (Lenat et al., 1990; Nirenburg et al., 1988; Chodorow et al., 1985).

However, bilingual parallel corpora have mostly been used for tasks related to word sense disambiguation such as target word selection (Dagan et al, 1991) and separation of senses (Dyvik, 1998). $$$$$ A related task in machine translation is target word selection â€” the task of deciding which target language word is the most appropriate equivalent of a source language word in context.
However, bilingual parallel corpora have mostly been used for tasks related to word sense disambiguation such as target word selection (Dagan et al, 1991) and separation of senses (Dyvik, 1998). $$$$$ These results for target word selection in machine translation suggest to use a similar mechanism even if we are interested only in word sense disambiguation within a single language!

For example, Brown et al (1991) and Gale et al (1992a, 1993) used the parallel, aligned Hansard Corpus of Canadian Parhamentary debates for WSD, and Dagan et al (1991) and Dagan and Ital (1994) used monolingual corpora of Hebrew and German and a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ Substantial application of semantic or pragmatic knowledge about the word and its context for broad domains requires compiling huge amounts of knowledge, whose usefulness for practical applications has not yet been proven (Lenat et al., 1990; Nirenburg et al., 1988; Chodorow et al., 1985).

(1990).
