We used a bilingual corpus (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) to examine which semantic frames of BFN contained LUs relevant to the Japanese verb osou. $$$$$ This is the first attempt at a Japanese-English bilingual corpus.
We used a bilingual corpus (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) to examine which semantic frames of BFN contained LUs relevant to the Japanese verb osou. $$$$$ We have applied our measures to a Japanese and English bilingual corpus and these are language independent.

The bilingual corpus used for our experiments was obtained from an automatically sentence aligned Japanese/English Yomiuri newspaper corpus consisting of 180K sentence pairs (refer to Table1) (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003). $$$$$ We evaluated the implemented program against a corpus consisting of manually aligned Japanese and English sentences.

Utiyama and Isahara (2003) extract Japanese-English parallel sentences from a noisy-parallel corpus. $$$$$ We have aligned Japanese and English news articles and sentences to make a large parallel corpus.
Utiyama and Isahara (2003) extract Japanese-English parallel sentences from a noisy-parallel corpus. $$$$$ They enhance each other and allow valid article and sentence alignments to be reliably extracted from an extremely noisy Japanese-English parallel corpus.

We used 1000 sentence pairs extracted from pre-aligned data (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) as a gold standard. $$$$$ We used 12 pairs of texts for evaluation.

For example, Munteanu and Marcu (2005) apply the Lemur IR toolkit, Utiyama and Isahara (2003) use the BM25 similarity measure, and Fung and Cheung (2004) use cosine similarity. $$$$$ We use BM25 and SIM to evaluate the similarity in articles and sentences, respectively.
For example, Munteanu and Marcu (2005) apply the Lemur IR toolkit, Utiyama and Isahara (2003) use the BM25 similarity measure, and Fung and Cheung (2004) use cosine similarity. $$$$$ BM25 measures the similarity between two bags of words.

For example, Zhao and Vogel (2002), Utiyama and Isahara (2003), and Munteanu and Marcu (2005) all acquire their comparable corpora from a collection of news articles which are either downloaded from the Web or archived by LDC. $$$$$ However, the relation between English news sentences and Japanese news sentences are not literal translations.

Works aimed at discovering parallel sentences include (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003), who use cross-language information retrieval techniques and dynamic programming to extract sentences from an English-Japanese comparable corpus. $$$$$ We first used a method based on cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) to align the Japanese and English articles and then used a method based on dynamic programming (DP) matching to align the Japanese and English sentences in these articles.

This database was an aggregate of several Japanese-English corpora, notably the Yomiuri newspaper corpus (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) and the JST paper abstract corpus created at NICT (www.nict.go.jp) through (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007). $$$$$ Therefore, it is not clear whether their method would have achieved a high accuracy in the Yomiuri corpus treated in this paper.
