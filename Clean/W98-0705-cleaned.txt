(Gonzalo et al., 1998) pointed out some more weaknesses of WordNet for Information Retrieval purposes, in particular the lack of domain information and the fact that sense distinctions are excessively fine-grained for the task. $$$$$ Other problems of WordNet for text retrieval include too much finegrained sense-distinctions and lack of domain information; see (Gonzalo et al., In press) for a more detailed discussion on the adequacy of WordNet structure for text retrieval.

Then, following previous studies (e.g., (Gonzaloet al, 1998)), we use the synsets relations in Word Net for query expansion. $$$$$ Query relations.
Then, following previous studies (e.g., (Gonzaloet al, 1998)), we use the synsets relations in Word Net for query expansion. $$$$$ A more reasonable approach here could be giving different probabilities for each sense of a word, and use them to weight synsets in the vectorial representation of documents and queries.

The LKB can be used, among others, for monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval, which has been demonstrated in other projects (Gonzalo et al, 1998). $$$$$ Other problems of WordNet for text retrieval include too much finegrained sense-distinctions and lack of domain information; see (Gonzalo et al., In press) for a more detailed discussion on the adequacy of WordNet structure for text retrieval.
The LKB can be used, among others, for monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval, which has been demonstrated in other projects (Gonzalo et al, 1998). $$$$$ A second goal is to apply synset indexing in a Cross-Language environment, using the Euro WordNet multilingual database (Gonzalo et al., In press).

Gonzalo et al (1998) cite this failure to model related senses in order to explain why their study into the effects of ambiguity showed radically different results to Sanderson (1994). $$$$$ 1994.

Gonzalo et al (1998) showed in an experiment, where words were manually disambiguated, that a substantial increase in performance is obtained when query words are disambiguated, before they are expanded. $$$$$ This is an excellent result, although we should keep in mind that is obtained with manually disambiguated queries and documents.
Gonzalo et al (1998) showed in an experiment, where words were manually disambiguated, that a substantial increase in performance is obtained when query words are disambiguated, before they are expanded. $$$$$ In Figure 3 we have plot the results of runs with a non-disambiguated version of the queries, both for word sense indexing and synset indexing, against the manually disambiguated collection (experiment 6).

(Gonzalo et al, 1998) demonstrates an increment in performance over an IR test collection using the sense data contained in SemCor over a purely term based model. $$$$$ We have adapted SEMCOR in order to build a test collection -that we call IR-SEMCOR- in four manual steps
