An historical account of this empirical renaissance is provide in [Church and Mercer, 1993]. $$$$$ Perhaps the most immediate reason for this empirical renaissance is the availability of massive quantities of data: more text is available than ever before.
An historical account of this empirical renaissance is provide in [Church and Mercer, 1993]. $$$$$ This is a particularly exciting area in computational linguistics as evidenced by the large number of contributions in these special issues: Biber (1993), Brent (1993), Hindle and Rooth (this issue), Pustejovsky et al. (1993), and Smadja (this issue).

However, using more data usually leads to better results, or how Church and Mercer (1993) put it more data are better data?. $$$$$ The other codes in Table 5 make better use of context (h), and therefore, they achieve better compression.
However, using more data usually leads to better results, or how Church and Mercer (1993) put it more data are better data?. $$$$$ Thus, it would appear that &quot;more data are better data,&quot; at least for the purpose of finding exemplars of words like imaginable.

which has commonly been used in the recent statistical NLP research (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Perhaps the most important indication of success is that many of these statistical tagging programs are now being used on large volumes of data (hundreds of millions of words of text) in a number of different application areas including speech synthesis (Sproat, personal communication; Liberman and Church 1991), speech recognition (Jelinek 1985; Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1991), information retrieval (Salton, Zhao, and Buckley 1990; Croft, Turtle, and Lewis 1991), sense disambiguation (Hearst 1991), and computational lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990a, 1990b; Church and Gale 1991).

 $$$$$ Other examples are shown in Table 1.
 $$$$$ Text Analysis has also prospered because of its tradition of evaluating performance with theoretically motivated numerical measures such as entropy.

Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Large corpus studies, such as the COBUILD dictionary, offer the hope that it might be possible to base a dictionary on a large and representative sample of the language as it is actually used.
Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ It may not be possible to properly balance a corpus.

Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Many of the very same methods are being applied to problems in natural language processing by many of the very same researchers.
Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993). $$$$$ Some tasks are probably more appropriate for Chomsky's rational approach to language and other tasks are probably more appropriate for Shannon's empirical approach to language.
