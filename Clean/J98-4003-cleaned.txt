Knight and Graehl (1998) proposed a Japanese-English transliteration method based on the mapping probability between English and Japanese katakana sounds. $$$$$ For example, Japanese has no distinct L and R. sounds

The first is machine transliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1998), in which names and technical terms are translated across languages with different sound systems. $$$$$ It is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories.

Knight and Graehl (1998) used a bilingual English-katakana dictionary, a katakana-to-English phoneme mapping, and the CMU Speech Pronunciation Dictionary to create a series of weighted finite-state transducers between English words and katakana that produce and rank transliteration candidates. $$$$$ Of these, 222 were missing from an on-line 100,000-entry bilingual dictionary.

We should emphasize that this is due to the difficulty of our test data, and that we have tested against a baseline that has been shown to outperform Knight and Graehl (1998). $$$$$ The katakana symbols are shown in Figure 1, with their Japanese pronunciations.

Systematic relationships between pairs of strings are at the core of problems such as transliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1998), morphology (Dreyer and Eisner, 2011), cross-document coreference resolution (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998), canonicalization (Culotta et al2007), and paraphrasing (Barzilay and Lee, 2003). $$$$$ Phonetic translation across these pairs is called transliteration.

Transliteration (Knight and Graehl, 1998) is a mapping from one system of writing into another, automation of which has been actively studied be tween English and other languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Japanese. $$$$$ However, the situation is more complicated for language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems, such as Japanese/English and Arabic/English.

Knight and Graehl (1998) model the transliteration of Japanese syllabic katakana script into English with a sequence of finite-state transducers. $$$$$ Next comes the POO model, which produces a 28-state/31-arc WFSA whose highest-scoring sequence is

Unlike the transducers proposed in (Stalls and Knight, 1998) and (Knight and Graehl, 1998) no attempt is made to model the pronunciation of words. $$$$$ Note that long Japanese vowel sounds Knight and Graehl Machine Transliteration are written with two symbols (a a) instead of just one (aa).
Unlike the transducers proposed in (Stalls and Knight, 1998) and (Knight and Graehl, 1998) no attempt is made to model the pronunciation of words. $$$$$ So this model also serves to filter out some ill-formed katakana sequences, possibly proposed by optical character recognition.

The seen test is similar to tests run in (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and (Stalls and Knight, 1998) where the models could not produce any words not included in the language. $$$$$ Note that long Japanese vowel sounds Knight and Graehl Machine Transliteration are written with two symbols (a a) instead of just one (aa).

Lee and Chang (2003) detect transliterations with a generative noisy channel transliteration model similar to the transducer presented in (Knight and Graehl, 1998). $$$$$ This method uses a generative model, incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process.

One area is the generative transliteration modeling (Knight and Graehl, 1998), which studies how to convert a word from one language to another using statistical models. $$$$$ Fortunately, there are techniques for coordinating solutions to such subproblems, and for using generative models in the reverse direction.

For example Knight and Graehl (1998) use the lexicon frequency. $$$$$ The biggest problem is that raw English frequency counts are not the best indication of whether a word is a possible source for transliteration.

If source and target languages have different phoneme sets, alignment between the different phonemes is also required (Knight and Graehl, 1998). $$$$$ It is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories.

Instead of using the lexicon frequency (Knight and Graehl, 1998) or Web statistics (Qu and Grefenstette, 2004), we propose validating transliteration pairs according to the alignment distance D between the aligned English graphemes and Chinese phonemes (see equations (2) and (5)). $$$$$ Phonetic translation across these pairs is called transliteration.

A straight forward supervised learning approach would require training data of name pairs between every pair of languages (Knight and Graehl, 1998). $$$$$ It is possible to automatically analyze such pairs to gain enough knowledge to accurately map new katakana phrases that come along, and this learning approach travels well to other language pairs.
