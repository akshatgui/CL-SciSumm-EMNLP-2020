Instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and active learning (Chan and Ng, 2007) are also employed in domain adaptation. $$$$$ Domain Adaptation with Active Learning for Word Sense Disambiguation
Instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and active learning (Chan and Ng, 2007) are also employed in domain adaptation. $$$$$ (2006) used active learning for 5 verbs using coarse-grained evaluation, and H. T. Dang (2004) employed active learning for another set of 5 verbs.

AL seems to improve results in a WSD task with coarse-grained sense distinctions (Chan and Ng, 2007), but the results of (Dang, 2004) raise doubts as to whether AL can successfully be applied to a fine-grained annotation scheme, where Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) is low and thus the consistency of the human annotations decreases. $$$$$ A similar work is the recent research by Chen et al. (2006), where active learning was used successfully to reduce the annotation effort for WSD of 5 English verbs using coarse-grained evaluation.

With the exception of (Chan and Ng, 2007) which tried to adapt a WSD system trained on the BC part of the DSO corpus to the WSJ part of the DSO corpus, the other researchers simply applied active learning to reduce the annotation effort required and did not deal with the issue of adapting a WSD system to a new domain. $$$$$ In that work, the authors only used active learning to reduce the annotation effort and did not deal with the porting of a WSD system to a new domain.
