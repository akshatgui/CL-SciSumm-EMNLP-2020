Recent results on the SPORTS and FINANCE gold standard dataset (Koeling et al 2005) show that domain WSD can achieve accuracy in the 50 60% ballpark when a state-of-the-art algorithm such as Personalized PageRank is paired with a distributional approach (Agirre et al 2009) or with semantic model vectors acquired for many domains (Navigli et al 2011). $$$$$ Magnini et al(2002) have shown that information about the do main of a document is very useful for WSD.

We also experimented with the gold standard produced by Koeling et al (2005). $$$$$ We then (section 3) describe the new gold standard corpora, and evaluate predominant sense accuracy (section 4).

We first test the proposed method over the tasks of predominant sense learning and sense distribution induction, using the WordNet-tagged dataset of Koeling et al (2005), which is made up of 3 collections of documents $$$$$ for unlisted senses where these are predominant in our annotated data.Although the predominant sense of a word is not al ways the domain-specific sense in a domain-specific corpus, the domain-specific senses typically occurmore than they do in non-relevant corpora.
We first test the proposed method over the tasks of predominant sense learning and sense distribution induction, using the WordNet-tagged dataset of Koeling et al (2005), which is made up of 3 collections of documents $$$$$ We compared the automatic rankings from the BNC with those from each domain specific corpus (SPORTS and FINANCE) for all polysemous nouns in SemCor.

We first notice that, despite the coarser-grained senses of Macmillan as compared to WordNet, the upper bound WSD accuracy using Macmillan is comparable to that of the WordNet-based datasets over the balanced BNC, and quite a bit lower than that of the two domain corpora of Koeling et al (2005). $$$$$ We use WordNet (WN) as our sense inventory.

The relative occurrence of unlisted/unclear senses in the datasets of Koeling et al (2005) is comparable to UKWAC. $$$$$ We use the method described in McCarthy et al (2004) for finding predominant senses from raw text.
