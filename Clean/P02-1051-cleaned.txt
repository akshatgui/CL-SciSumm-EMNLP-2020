(Al-Onaizan and Knight 2002) showed that use of outside linguistic resources such as WWW counts of transliteration candidates can greatly boost transliteration accuracy. $$$$$ Transliteration between languages that use similar alphabets and sound systems is very simple.

 $$$$$ The spelling-based model we propose (described in detail in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002)) directly According to this model, the transliteration probability is given by the following equation: maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences with probability , which are trained on a small English/Arabic name list without the need for English pronunciations.

A spelling-based model is described in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002c) that directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences with associated probability that are trained on a small English/Arabic name list without the need for English pronunciations. $$$$$ For example, English P and B are both mapped into Arabic “ b”; Arabic “ h. ” and “ h-” into English H; and so on.

The phonetics-based and spelling-based models have been linearly combined into a single transliteration model in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b) for transliteration of Arabic named entities into English. $$$$$ The transliteration process is based on a generative model of how an English name is transliterated into Arabic.

Yaser Al-Onaizan (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) transliterated an NE in Arabic into several candidates in English and ranked the candidates by comparing their counts in several English corpora. $$$$$ For example, English P and B are both mapped into Arabic “ b”; Arabic “ h. ” and “ h-” into English H; and so on.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) describe a system which combines a phonetic based model with a spelling model for transliteration. $$$$$ To address these limitations, we extend this approach by using a new spelling-based model in addition to the phonetic-based model.

For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation. $$$$$ Stalls and Knight (1998) present an Arabic-toEnglish back-transliteration system based on the source-channel framework.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters. $$$$$ Transliteration is the process of replacing words in the source language with their approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents in the target language.
Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters. $$$$$ This can be done by searching for a document in the target language that is similar to the one being translated from the source language.

Similarly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable. $$$$$ Transliteration between languages that use similar alphabets and sound systems is very simple.

Previous work on defining subtasks within statistical machine translation has been performed on, e.g., noun-noun pair (Cao and Li, 2002) and named entity translation (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002). $$$$$ Statistical machine translation systems can use such a system as a component to handle phrase translation in order to improve overall translation quality.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002), Huang (2003) and Ji and Grishman (2007) investigated the general name entity translation problem, especially in the context of machine translation. $$$$$ This translation problem is especially challenging because new phrases can appear from nowhere, and because many named-entities are domain specific, not to be found in bilingual dictionaries.
