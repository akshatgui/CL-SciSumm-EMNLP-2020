It also corresponds to the pyramid measure proposed by Nenkova and Passonneau (2004), which also considers an estimation of the maximum value reachable. $$$$$ The expected value for the point of divergence of scores, in terms of number of summaries in the pyramid, is 5.5.
It also corresponds to the pyramid measure proposed by Nenkova and Passonneau (2004), which also considers an estimation of the maximum value reachable. $$$$$ First, this corresponds to the difference in PAL scores (D31041) we find when we use a different one of our three PAL annotations (see Table 1).

In evaluations of summarization algorithms, it is common practice to derive the gold standard con tent importance scores from human summaries, as done, for example, in the pyramid method, where the importance of a content element corresponds to the number of reference human summaries that make use of it (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). $$$$$ Our method quantifies the relative importance of facts to be conveyed.

To evaluate our system, we use the pyramid evaluation method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) at sentence level. $$$$$ In (Passonneau, 2004), we report our method for computing reliability for coreference annotations, and the use of a distance metric that allows us to weight disagreements.
To evaluate our system, we use the pyramid evaluation method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) at sentence level. $$$$$ For the DUC scores there was always a single model, and no attempt to evaluate the model.

Each fact in the citation summary of a paper is a summarization content unit (SCU) (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), and the fact distribution matrix, created by annotation, provides the information about the importance of each fact in the citation summary. $$$$$ Our approach acknowledges the fact that no single best model summary exists, and takes this as a foundation rather than an obstacle.
Each fact in the citation summary of a paper is a summarization content unit (SCU) (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), and the fact distribution matrix, created by annotation, provides the information about the importance of each fact in the citation summary. $$$$$ This makes sense in light of the fact that a score is dominated by the higher weight SCUS that appear in a summary.

These annotations give the list of nuggets covered by each sentence in each citation summary, which are equivalent to the summarization content unit (SCU) as described in (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). $$$$$ A more detailed account of the work described here, but not including the study of distributional properties of pyramid scores, can be found in (Passonneau and Nenkova, 2003).

In the PYRAMID scheme for manual evaluation of summaries (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), machine-generated summaries were compared with human-written ones at the nugget level. $$$$$ Human-written summaries can score as low as 0.1 while machine summaries can score as high as 0.5.
In the PYRAMID scheme for manual evaluation of summaries (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), machine-generated summaries were compared with human-written ones at the nugget level. $$$$$ Here we use three DUC 2003 summary sets for which four human summaries were written.

Pyramid evaluation $$$$$ Evaluating Content Selection In Summarization

Paralleling work in summarization, it is hypothesized that the quality of a rewritten story can be defined by the presence or absence of 'semantic content units' that are crucial details of the text that may have a variety of syntactic forms (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). $$$$$ Our analysis of summary content is based on Summarization Content Units, or SCUs and we will now proceed to define the concept.

Three most noticeable efforts in manual evaluation are SEE (Lin and Hovy, 2001), Factoid (Van Halteren and Teufel, 2003), and the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). $$$$$ We do not attempt to represent the subsumption or implicational relations that Halteren and Teufel assign to factoids (Halteren and Teufel, 2003).

This paraphrase matching process is observed in the Pyramid annotation procedure shown in (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) over three summary sets (10 summaries each). $$$$$ The label, which is subject to revision throughout the annotation process, has three functions.

From an in-depth analysis on the manually created SCUs of the DUC2003 summary set D30042 (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), we find that 54.48% of 1746 cases where a non-stop word from one SCU did not match with its supposedly human-aligned pairing SCUs are in need of some level of paraphrase matching support. $$$$$ Our analysis of summary content is based on Summarization Content Units, or SCUs and we will now proceed to define the concept.

To assess the quality of system responses, we adopt the nugget-based methodology used previously for many types of complex questions (Voorhees, 2003), which shares similarities with the pyramid evaluation scheme used in summarization (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). $$$$$ In machine translation, the rankings from the automatic BLEU method (Papineni et al., 2002) have been shown to correlate well with human evaluation, and it has been widely used since and has even been adapted for summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

They report a marginal increase in the automatic word overlap metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004), but a decline in manual Pyramid (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004). $$$$$ Additionally, the task of determining the percentage overlap between two text units turns out to be difficult to annotate reliably – (Lin and Hovy, 2002) report that humans agreed with their own prior judgment in only 82% of the cases.

Pyramid (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) is a manually evaluated measure of recall on facts or Semantic Content Units appearing in the reference summaries. $$$$$ Our method involves semantic matching of content units to which differential weights are assigned based on their frequency in a corpus of summaries.
Pyramid (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) is a manually evaluated measure of recall on facts or Semantic Content Units appearing in the reference summaries. $$$$$ Thus scores can be computed using one, two and so on up to five reference summaries.
