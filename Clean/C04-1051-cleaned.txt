We are currently experimenting with data extracted from the first two sentences in each article, which by journalistic convention tend to summarize content (Dolan et al 2004). $$$$$ To isolate just those sentence pairs that represent likely paraphrases without requiring significant string similarity, we exploited a common journalistic convention

The dataset is 5,801 pairs of sentences collected from news sources (Dolan et al, 2004). $$$$$ We investigate unsupervised techniques for acquiring monolingual sentence-level paraphrases from a corpus of temporally and topically clustered news articles collected from thousands of web-based news sources.

The F2 dataset was constructed from the first two sentences of the corpus on the same assumptions as those used in Dolan et al (2004). $$$$$ We will refer to this dataset as L12.

For these reasons, we used the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) introduced by Dolan et al2004). $$$$$ We conclude that paraphrase research would benefit by identifying richer data sources and developing appropriate learning techniques.
For these reasons, we used the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) introduced by Dolan et al2004). $$$$$ Each corpus was used as input to the word alignment algorithms available in Giza++ (Och & Ney 2000).

We employ 8 different MT metrics for identifying paraphrases across two different datasets the well-known Microsoft Research paraphrase corpus (MSRP) (Dolan et al, 2004) and the plagiarism detection corpus (PAN) from the 2010 Uncovering Plagiarism, Authorship and Social Software Misuse shared task (Potthast et al, 2010). $$$$$ (Shinyama, et al 2002; Lin & Pantel 2001).

For instance, with the advent of news aggregator services such as GoogleNews, one can readily collect multiple news stories covering the same news item (Dolan et al,2004). $$$$$ Our two paraphrase datasets are distilled from a corpus of news articles gathered from thousands of news sources over an extended period.

Dolan et al (2004) used Web-aggregated news stories to learn both sentence-level and word-level alignments. $$$$$ We investigate unsupervised techniques for acquiring monolingual sentence-level paraphrases from a corpus of temporally and topically clustered news articles collected from thousands of web-based news sources.
Dolan et al (2004) used Web-aggregated news stories to learn both sentence-level and word-level alignments. $$$$$ A simple edit distance metric (Levenshtein 1966) was used to identify pairs of sentences within a cluster that are similar at the string level.

Levenshtein distance has been used in natural language processing field as a component in the variety of tasks, including semantic role labeling (Tjong Kim Sang et al, 2005), construction of the paraphrase corpora (Dolan et al, 2004), evaluation of machine translation output (Leusch et al, 2003), and others. $$$$$ (Shinyama, et al 2002; Lin & Pantel 2001).

Although the F2 heuristic proposed by Dolan et al (2004), which takes the first two sentences of each document pair, obtains higher relatedness score (we evaluated F2 sentences as 50% paraphrases, 37% related, and 13% unrelated), our n-gram overlap method extracted much more sentence pairs per document pair. $$$$$ To prevent too high an incidence of unrelated sentences, one string-based heuristic filter was found useful
