Our analysis requires semantic role labels for each argument of the nominal predicates in the Penn Treebank precisely what NomBank (Meyers et al, 2004) provides. $$$$$ Although the PropBanker should work with input in the form of either treebank annotation or treebankbased parser output, this project only requires application to the Penn Treebank itself.

We have a list of approximately 4000 deverbal noun/ verb pairs, constructed from a combination of WordNet? s derivational links (Fellbaum,1998), NomLex (Macleod et al, 1998), NomLexPlus (Meyers et al, 2004b) and some independent curation. $$$$$ Toward this end, we pooled a number of resources

In recent years, NomBank (Meyers et al,2004a) has provided a set of about 200,000 manually annotated instances of nominalizations with arguments, giving rise to supervised machine learned approaches such as (Pradhan et al, 2004) and (Liu and Ng, 2007), which perform fairly wellin the overall task of classifying deverbal arguments. $$$$$ At least 36,000 of these are nouns that cannot take arguments and therefore need not be looked at by an There are approximately 99,000 instances of verbal nominalizations or related items (e.g., cousins) There are approximately 34,000 partitives (including 6,000 instances of the percent sign), 18,000 subject nominalizations, 14,000 environmental nouns, 14,000 relational nouns and fewer instances of the various other classes.

To extract relations we used the parser by Johansson and Nugues (2008) to annotate sentences with dependencies and shallow semantics in the PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005) and NomBank (Meyers et al, 2004) frameworks. $$$$$ Toward this end, we pooled a number of resources

Both parsing is formulated as a single-stage word-pair classification problem, and the latter is carried out by a search through the NomBank (Meyers et al, 2004) or the PropBank (Palmer et al, 2005). $$$$$ Toward this end, we pooled a number of resources

As a complement to PropBank, NomBank (Meyers et al,2004) annotates nominal predicates and their corresponding semantic roles using similar semantic framework as PropBank. $$$$$ For nominalizations of verbs that were covered in PropBank, we used straightforward procedures to convert existing PropBank lexical entries to nominal ones.
