Elworthy (1994), in contrast, reports an accuracy of 75.49%, 80.87% and 79.12% for unsupervised word-based HMM trained on parts of the LOB corpora, with a tag set of 134 tags. $$$$$ For example, the LOB tagset used 134 tags, while the Penn treebank tagset has 48.

While this observation confirms Elworthy (1994), the impact of error reduction is much less than reported there for English about 70% (79? 94). $$$$$ Preparing tagged corpora either by hand is labour-intensive and potentially error-prone, and although a semi-automatic approach can be used (Marcus et al., 1993), it is a good thing to reduce the human involvement as much as possible.

Experimental results confirming this wisdom have been presented ,e.g., by Elworthy (1994) and Pereira and Schabes (1992) for EM training of Hidden Markov Models and PCFGs. $$$$$ One widely used approach makes use of a statistical technique called a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

Although [Kupiec, 1992] presented a very sophisticated method of unsupervised learning, [Elworthy, 1994] reported that re-estimation is not always helpful. $$$$$ With the availability of large corpora and fast computers, there has been a recent resurgence of interest, and a number of variations on and alternatives to the FB, Viterbi and BW algorithms have been tried; see the work of, for example, Church (Church, 1988), Brill (Brill and Marcus, 1992; Brill, 1992), DeRose (DeRose, 1988) and Kupiec (Kupiec, 1992).

However, Merialdo (1994) and Elworthy (1994) have criticized methods of estimation from an untagged corpus based on the maximum likelihood principle. $$$$$ The conclusions are broadly in agreement with those of Merialdo (1994), but give greater detail about the contributions of different parts of the model.

Discuss ion and Future Work Merialdo (1994) and Elworthy (1994) have insisted, based on their experimental results, that the maximum likelihood training using an untagged corpus does not necessarily improve tagging accuracy. $$$$$ We will discuss this work below.

Our findings support those of Elworthy (1994) and Merialdo (1994) for POS tagging and suggest that EM is not always the most suitable semi-supervised training method (especially when some in-domain training data is available). $$$$$ If significant human intervention is needed to provide the biasing, then the advantages of automatic training become rather weaker, especially if such intervention is needed on each new text domain.

We considered three taggers: the El worthy bigram tagger (Elworthy, 1994) within the RASP parser (Briscoe et al, 2006), an enhanced. $$$$$ One of the most effective taggers based on a pure HMM is that developed at Xerox (Cutting et al., 1992).

The advantage of combining unsupervised and supervised learning over using supervised in [Elworthy, 1994] quotes accuracy on ambiguous words, which we have converted to overall accuracy. $$$$$ For a corpus in which a fraction a of the words are ambiguous, and p is the accuracy on ambiguous words, the overall accuracy can be recovered from 1 â€” a + pa. All of the accuracy figures quoted below are for ambiguous words only.
The advantage of combining unsupervised and supervised learning over using supervised in [Elworthy, 1994] quotes accuracy on ambiguous words, which we have converted to overall accuracy. $$$$$ As an example of how these figures relate to overall accuracies, LOB-B contains 32.35% ambiguous tokens with respect to the lexicon from LOB-B-J, and the overall accuracy in the DO+TO case is hence 98.69%.
