Consequently, lexicalized grammars offer significant parsing benefits (Schabes et al, 1988) as the number of applications of productions (i.e., derivation steps) is clearly bounded by the length of the input string. $$$$$ The number of rules that can be used for a given sentence is bounded and is proportional to the length of the sentence.

At the same time, there is growing interest in parsing with more sophisticated lexicalized grammar formalisms, such as Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 1982), Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Schabes et al, 1988), Head driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollardand Sag, 1994) and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000), which represent deep syntactic structures that can not be expressed in a shallower formalism designed to represent only aspects of surface syntax, such as the dependency formalism used in current mainstream dependency parsing. $$$$$ We say that a grammar formalism is lexicalized if it consists of: ?

Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) is classified into lexicalized grammars (Schabes et al, 1988). $$$$$ If a structure has only one terminal, the terminal is the head of the structure; if there are several terminals, the choice of the head is linguistically motivated, e.g.

The Fergus system (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000) uses LTAG (Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Schabes et al, 1988)) for generating a word lattice containing realizations and selects the best one using a trigram model. White and Baldridge (2003) developed a chart generator for CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000)) and proposed several techniques for efficient generation such as best-first search, beam thresholding and chunking the input logical forms (White, 2004). $$$$$ The domain of locality of a CFG can be extended by using a tree rewriting system that only uses substitution.
