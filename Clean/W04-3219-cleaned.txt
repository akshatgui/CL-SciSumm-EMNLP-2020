However, it has been shown that the coverage of the paraphrase patterns is not high enough, especially when the used paraphrase pat terns are long or complicated (Quirk et al, 2004). $$$$$ Changing a single content word is a legitimate form of paraphrase, and the ability to paraphrase across an arbitrarily large sentence set and arbitrary domains is a desideratum of paraphrase research.
