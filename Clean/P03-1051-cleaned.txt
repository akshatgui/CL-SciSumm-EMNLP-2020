The segmentation model is similar to the one presented by Lee et al (2003), and obtains an accuracy of about 98%. $$$$$ We have presented a robust word segmentation algorithm which segments a word into a prefix*-stem-suffix* sequence, along with experimental results.

For training, we used the non-UN portion of the NIST training corpora, which was segmented using an HMMsegmenter (Lee et al, 2003). $$$$$ We present experimental results illustrating the impact of three factors on segmentation error rate

The Arabic data was preprocessed using an HMM segmenter that splits off attached prepositional phrases, personal pronouns, and the future marker (Lee et al, 2003). $$$$$ Many instances of prefixes and suffixes in Arabic are meaning bearing and correspond to a word in English such as pronouns and prepositions.
The Arabic data was preprocessed using an HMM segmenter that splits off attached prepositional phrases, personal pronouns, and the future marker (Lee et al, 2003). $$$$$ The trigram model is smoothed using deleted interpolation with the bigram and unigram models, (Jelinek 1997), as in (1)

Lee et al (2003) demonstrates a technique for segmenting Arabic text and uses it as a morphological processing step in machine translation. $$$$$ (Darwish 2002), is not very useful for applications like statistical machine translation, (Brown et al. 1993), for which an accurate word-to-word alignment between the source and the target languages is critical for high quality translations.
Lee et al (2003) demonstrates a technique for segmenting Arabic text and uses it as a morphological processing step in machine translation. $$$$$ Our future work includes (i) application of the current technique to other highly inflected languages, (ii) application of the unsupervised stem acquisition technique on about 1 billion word unsegmented Arabic corpus, and (iii) adoption of a novel morphological analysis technique to handle irregular morphology, as realized in Arabic broken plurals YL+S (ktAb) 'book' vs. ��„�< (ktb) 'books'.

 $$$$$ This allows us to segment new words with a high accuracy even with a relatively high number of unknown stems in the language model vocabulary, cf. experimental results in Tables 5 & 6.

To separate the Arabic white-space delimited words into segments, we use a segmentation model similar to the one presented by (Lee et al, 2003). $$$$$ The input to the morpheme segmenter is a sequence of Arabic tokens – we use a tokenizer that looks only at white space and other punctuation, e.g. quotation marks, parentheses, period, comma, etc.

We propose in the following an extension to the aforementioned FST model, where we jointly determines not only diacritics but segmentation into affixes as described in (Lee et al, 2003). $$$$$ Language Model Based Arabic Word Segmentation

The algorithm is inspired with the work on the segmentation of Arabic words (Lee et al, 2003). $$$$$ However, our work diverges from their work in two crucial respects

Lee et al (2003) use a corpus of manually segmented words, which appears to be a subset of the first release of the ATB (110,000 words), and thus comparable to our training corpus. $$$$$ We present experimental results illustrating the impact of three factors on segmentation error rate

Lee et al (2003) show that the unsupervised use of the large corpus for stem identification increases accuracy. $$$$$ Interestingly, the segmenter developed from a 110K manually segmented corpus has the lowest percentage of “unknown stem” errors at 39.6% indicating that our unsupervised acquisition of new stems is working well, as well as suggesting to use a larger unsegmented corpus for unsupervised stem acquisition.

Lee et al (2003) addressed supervised word segmentation in Arabic and have some aspects similar to our approach. $$$$$ Language Model Based Arabic Word Segmentation
Lee et al (2003) addressed supervised word segmentation in Arabic and have some aspects similar to our approach. $$$$$ Our Arabic word segmentation system implementing the algorithm achieves around 97% segmentation accuracy on a development test corpus containing 28,449 word tokens.

As estimated by (Lee et al, 2003), we set the probability of ?u/k? to be 1E? 9. $$$$$ In that case, we use an “UNKNOWN” class in the trigram language model with the model probability given by p(UNKNOWN

We found that the value proposed by (Lee et al, 2003) for Arabic gives good results also for Hebrew. $$$$$ The trigram model is smoothed using deleted interpolation with the bigram and unigram models, (Jelinek 1997), as in (1)

Moving on to Arabic, Lee et al (2003) describe a word segmentation system for Arabic that uses an n gram language model over morphemes. $$$$$ Language Model Based Arabic Word Segmentation
