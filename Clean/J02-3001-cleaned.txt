Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) describe a statistical system trained on the data from the FrameNet project to automatically assign semantic roles. $$$$$ Given an input sentence and a target word frame, the system labels constituents with either abstract semantic roles, such as or more domain-specific semantic roles, such as and The system is based on statistical classifiers trained on roughly 50,000 sentences that were hand-annotated with semantic roles by the FrameNet semantic labeling project.

In previous work using the FrameNet corpus, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of Collins (1997). $$$$$ We used Collins’ (1997) statistical parser trained on examples from the Penn Treebank to generate parses of the same format for the sentences in our data.

Early work in frame-semantic analysis was pioneered by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). $$$$$ We return to an analysis of which roles are hardest to classify in Section 9.1.

The first SRL model on FrameNet was proposed by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). $$$$$ As a rule, the more abstract roles have been proposed by linguists, who are more concerned with explaining generalizations across verbs in the syntactic realization of their arguments, whereas the more specific roles have more often been proposed by computer scientists, who are more concerned with the details of the realization of the arguments of specific verbs.
The first SRL model on FrameNet was proposed by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). $$$$$ FrameNet roles are defined for each semantic frame.

Many of the features used are inspired by those used in semantic role labeling systems (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ Automatic Labeling Of Semantic Roles
Many of the features used are inspired by those used in semantic role labeling systems (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ We now turn to combining the two systems described above into a complete role labeling system.

Following the architecture of earlier semantic parsers like Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), we treat the semantic parsing task as a 1-of-N classification problem. $$$$$ For example, the JUDGEMENT frame contains roles like JUDGE, EVALUEE, and REASON, and the STATEMENT frame contains roles like SPEAKER, ADDRESSEE, and MESSAGE, as the following examples show

Generally speaking, these SRL approaches use a two-stage architecture $$$$$ Allowing role assignments to influence boundary identification improves results both on the unlabeled boundary identification task and on the combined identification and labeling task.
Generally speaking, these SRL approaches use a two-stage architecture $$$$$ We would expect verbs in the same frame to be semantically similar and to have the same patterns of argument structure.

The features are listed as follows $$$$$ Like the governing-category feature described above, the parse tree path feature (path) is designed to capture the syntactic relation of a constituent to the rest of the sentence.
The features are listed as follows $$$$$ In cases in which the path feature includes an S or VP ancestor of an NP node as part of the path to the target word, the gov feature is a function of the path feature.

Automatic Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that maps sentences to semantic representations and identifies the semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ Automatic Labeling Of Semantic Roles

Our domain-independent layer bears some similarity to other semantic tasks, most notably Semantic-Role Labeling (SRL) introduced in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), in which identifying the predicate-argument structure is considered a preprocessing step, prior to assigning argument labels. $$$$$ Then a simple system using the predicate’s argument structure, or syntactic signature, as the primary feature will be contrasted with previous systems based on local, independent features.

While previous programs with similar goals (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) were statistics-based, this tool will be based completely on hand-coded rules and lexical resources. $$$$$ Surprisingly, the EM-based interpolation performed better than the lattice-based system on the held-out test set, but not on the data used to set the weights in the EM-based system.
While previous programs with similar goals (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) were statistics-based, this tool will be based completely on hand-coded rules and lexical resources. $$$$$ The WordNet experiment, on the other hand, indicates both the usefulness of hand-built resources when they apply and the difficulty of attaining broad coverage with such resources.

For example, simply adding whether each word is part of a noun or verb phrase using the hand annotated parse tree (the so-called GOV feature from (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002)) improves the performance of our system from 83.95% to 85.8%. $$$$$ Sentences from each subcorpus were then annotated by hand, marking boundaries of each frame element expressed in the sentence and assigning tags for the annotated constituent’s frame semantic role, syntactic category (e.g., noun phrase or prepositional phrase), and grammatical function in relation to the target word (e.g., object or complement of a verb).

Automatic semantic role labeling was first introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). $$$$$ Automatic Labeling Of Semantic Roles
Automatic semantic role labeling was first introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002). $$$$$ One way around this problem is to integrate boundary identification with role labeling, allowing the FEG priors and the role-labeling decisions to affect which constituents are frame elements.

Their features are usually extended from Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)'s work, which uses flat information derived from a parse tree. $$$$$ The system will be extended in later sections.

This includes the majority of work on shallow semantic analysis (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002, inter alia). $$$$$ Data-driven techniques have recently been applied to template-based semantic interpretation in limited domains by “shallow” systems that avoid complex feature structures and often perform only shallow syntactic analysis.
