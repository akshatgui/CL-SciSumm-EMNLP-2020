The weights of the log-linear translation models were tuned towards the BLEU metric on development data using cdec's (Dyer et al, 2010) implementation of MERT (Och, 2003). $$$$$ Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003), lexical translation models (Brown et al., 1993), and finite-state conditional random fields (Sha and Pereira, 2003) exemplify the former, and hierarchical phrase-based models the latter (Chiang, 2007).

In modern machine translation systems such as Joshua (Li et al, 2009) and cdec (Dyer et al, 2010), a translation model is represented as a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG). $$$$$ We introduce a software package called cdec that manipulates both classes in a unified way.1 Although open source decoders for both phrasebased and hierarchical translation models have been available for several years (Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009), their extensibility to new models and algorithms is limited by two significant design flaws that we have avoided with cdec.

Finally, the cdec decoder (Dyer et al, 2010) includes a grammar extractor that performs well only when all rules can be held in memory. $$$$$ Rather than computing an error surface using kbest approximations of the decoder search space, cdec’s implementation performs inference over the full hypergraph structure (Kumar et al., 2009).

The work reported in this paper was carried out while the author was at the University of Cambridge.It has been noted that line optimisation over a lattice can be implemented as a semi-ring of sets of linear functions (Dyer et al, 2010). $$$$$ In particular, by defining a semiring whose values are sets of line segments, having an addition operation equivalent to union, and a multiplication operation equivalent to a linear transformation of the line segments, Och’s line search can be computed simply using the INSIDE algorithm.
