Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri,1997). $$$$$ Both determinization (Mohri 1994c) and minimization algorithms (Mohri 1994b) have been defined for the class of p-subsequential transducers, which includes sequential string-to-string transducers.
Application of cascades of weighted string transducers (WSTs) has been well-studied (Mohri,1997). $$$$$ The complexity of the application of subsequential transducers is linear in the size of the string to which it applies.

We recall previous formal presentations of WSTs (Mohri, 1997) and note informally that they may be represented as directed graphs with designated start and end states and edges labeled with input symbols, output symbols, and weights. $$$$$ The symbols of the alphabet Q = {xl, x2} store information about the size of the input string w. The output of L ends with x1 iff I wl is odd.

To apply the rules defining the classes to the input corpus, we just need to compose the automaton with a and project the result on the output: X can be made stochastic using a pushing algorithm (Mohri, 1997). $$$$$ Notice that if one wishes to construct the result of the determinization of T for a given input string w, one does not need to expand the whole result of the determinization, but only the necessary part of the determinized transducer.
