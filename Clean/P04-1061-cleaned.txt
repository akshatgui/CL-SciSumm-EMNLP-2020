However, previous computational models of grammar induction (Klein and Manning, 2004), including infant grammar induction (Kwiatkowski et al, 2012), have not addressed filler-gap comprehension. $$$$$ Corpus-Based Induction Of Syntactic Structure

In the field of language acquisition computational linguists such as Klein and Manning (2004) have studied the unsupervised acquisition of syntactic structure, while linguists such as Boersma and Hayes (2001), Gold smith (2001), Pater (2008) and Albright and Hayes (2003) are developing probabilistic models of the acquisition of phonology and/or morphology, and Frank et al (2007) experimentally tests the predictions of a Bayesian model of lexical acquisition. $$$$$ Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons

 $$$$$ We propose a simple head-outward dependency model over word classes which includes a model of valence, which we call DMV (for dependency model with valence).

We use the standard generative Dependency Model with Valence (Klein and Manning, 2004). $$$$$ present a generative model for the learning of dependency structures.

As we explain at the end of this section, without this aspect the generative story closely resembles the classic dependency model with valence (DMV) of Klein and Manning (2004). $$$$$ For the DMV, it is already a model over these structures.

We follow an approach similar to the widely-referenced DMV model (Klein and Manning, 2004), which forms the basis of the current state-of-the-art unsupervised grammar induction model (Headden III et al, 2009). $$$$$ For the DMV, it is already a model over these structures.

We encode more detailed valence information than Klein and Manning (2004) and condition child generation on parent valence. $$$$$ First, most state-ofthe-art supervised parsers make use of specific lexical information in addition to word-class level information – perhaps lexical information could be a useful source of information for unsupervised methods.

The resulting simplified model closely resembles DMV (Klein and Manning, 2004), except that it 1) explicitly generate words x rather than only part of-speech tags s, 2) encodes richer context and valence information, and 3) imposes a Dirichlet prior on the symbol distribution. $$$$$ We propose a simple head-outward dependency model over word classes which includes a model of valence, which we call DMV (for dependency model with valence).

Finally, following (Klein and Manning, 2004) we strip out punctuation from the sentences. $$$$$ WSJ10 is the subset of sentences which contained 10 words or less after the removal of punctuation.
Finally, following (Klein and Manning, 2004) we strip out punctuation from the sentences. $$$$$ To avoid this bias, we alter the DMV in the following ways.

The maximum unsupervised accuracy it achieved on the Bulgarian data is 47.6% with initialization from Klein and Manning (2004) and this result is not stable. $$$$$ Most recent progress in unsupervised parsing has come from tree or phrase-structure grammar based models (Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002), but there are compelling reasons to reconsider unsupervised dependency parsing.

Although we could also try many random starting points, the initializer in Klein and Manning (2004) performs quite well. $$$$$ Dependencies are seen as ordered (head, dependent) pairs of words, but the score of a dependency can optionally condition on other characteristics of the structure, most often the direction of the dependency (whether the arrow points left or right).
Although we could also try many random starting points, the initializer in Klein and Manning (2004) performs quite well. $$$$$ Previous work has shown that even this quite simple representation allows the induction of quite high quality word classes, largely corresponding to traditional parts of speech (Finch, 1993; Sch¨utze, 1995; Clark, 2000).

While these results are worse than those obtained previously for this model, the experiments in Klein and Manning (2004) only used sentences of 10 words or fewer, without punctuation, and with gold-standard tags. $$$$$ WSJ10 is the subset of sentences which contained 10 words or less after the removal of punctuation.
While these results are worse than those obtained previously for this model, the experiments in Klein and Manning (2004) only used sentences of 10 words or fewer, without punctuation, and with gold-standard tags. $$$$$ Again, if we modify the gold standard so as to make determiners the head of NPs, then this model with distributional tags scores 50.6% on directed and 64.8% on undirected dependency accuracy.

Second, consistent syntactic representations are desirable in the evaluation of unsupervised (Klein and Manning, 2004) or cross-lingual syntactic parsers (Hwa et al., 2005). $$$$$ Corpus-Based Induction Of Syntactic Structure

Fortunately, the state of the art in broad-coverage (Lin, 1993) and unsupervised (Klein and Manning, 2004) dependency parsing allows us to treat dependency parsing merely as a preprocessing step. $$$$$ The product model outperforms both components on their respective evaluation metrics, giving the best published figures for undependency parsing constituency parsing.

In DMV (Klein and Manning, 2004) and in the extended model EVG (Headden III et al, 2009), there is a STOP sign indicating that no more dependents in a given direction will be generated. $$$$$ If a stop is generated, no more arguments are generated for the current head to the current side.
