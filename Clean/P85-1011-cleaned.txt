Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985) introduced the first TAG parser in a CYK-like algorithm. $$$$$ A similar assumption is made in CYK algorithm.

In particular, the algorithm presented in [Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985] can be seen to corresponds to the approach involving the use of cfg to encode derivations, whereas, the algorithm of [Vijay-Shanker and Weir, in pressb] uses lig in this role. $$$$$ This can be seen as follows.

As an example, we introduce a CYK-based algorithm (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) for TAG. $$$$$ Example 2.5

In this section, we make a comparison of several different TAG parsing algorithms - the CYK based algorithm described at (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985), Earley-based algorithms with (Alonso et al, 1999) and without (Schabes, 1994) the valid prefix property (VPP), and Nederhof's algorithm (Nederhof, 1999) - on the XTAG English grammar (release 2.24.2001), by using our system and the ideas we have explained. $$$$$ The parsing algorithm is described is detail in section 3.
