Prior work in discovering non-compositional phrases has been carried out by Lin (1999) and Baldwin et al (2003), who also used LSA to distinguish between compositional and non compositional verb-particle constructions and noun noun compounds. $$$$$ Automatic Identification Of Non-Compositional Phrases
Prior work in discovering non-compositional phrases has been carried out by Lin (1999) and Baldwin et al (2003), who also used LSA to distinguish between compositional and non compositional verb-particle constructions and noun noun compounds. $$$$$ We examined three types of dependency relationships: object-verb, noun-noun, and adjective-noun.

Dekang Lin proposes a way to automatically identify the noncompositionality of MWEs (Lin, 1999). $$$$$ For example, (Lin, 1998) compared automatically created thesaurus with the WordNet (Miller et a).., 1990) and Roget's Thesaurus.

Least mutual information difference with similar collocations: this feature is based on Lin's work (Lin, 1999). $$$$$ For each marked pairs, the &quot;similar collocation&quot; column provides a similar collocation with a similar mutual information value (i.e., the reason why the pair is not consider to be non-compositional).

Lin (1999) gave a corpus-based method for finding various types of non-compositional phrases, including the sort discussed in this paper. $$$$$ Less obviously, non-compositional expressions need to be treated differently than other phrases in many statistical or corpus-based NLP methods.

Recent work which attempts to discriminate between compositional and non-compositional MWEs include Lin (1999), who used mutual information measures identify such phrases, Bald win et al (2003), who compare the distribution of the head of the MWE with the distribution of the entire MWE, and Vallada Moiro and Tiedemann (2006), who use a word-alignment strategy to identify non-compositional MWEs making use of parallel texts. $$$$$ Not only many combinations are found in the corpus, many of them have very similar mutual information values to that of nomial distribution can be accurately approximated by a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993).

Inspired by Lin (1999), we examine the strength of association between the verb and noun constituents of the target combination and its variants, as an indirect cue to their idiomaticity. $$$$$ For our evaluation purposes, we selected the idioms in NTC-EID that satisfy both of the following two conditions: (4) a. the head word of the idiom is one of the above 10 words. b. there is a verb-object, noun-noun, or adjective-noun relationship in the idiom and the modifier in the phrase is not a variable.

Lin (1999) assumes that a target expression is non-compositional if and only if its (I) J+ value is significantly different from that of any of the variants. $$$$$ A phrase is probably non-compositional if such substitutions are not found in the collocation database or their mutual information values are significantly different from that of the phrase.

Second, some n-grams themselves carry no linguistic meaning; their phrase translations can be misleading, for example non-compositional phrases (Lin, 1999). $$$$$ In machine translation, word-for-word translation of non-compositional expressions can result in very misleading (sometimes laughable) translations.

To protect against that problem, we compute the 99.99999% confidence intervals around the PMI (Lin, 1999), and use the lower bound as a measure of association. $$$$$ Since our confidence of p falling between/.1/--V-In. is N%, we can have N% confidence that the true mutual information is within the upper and lower bound.
To protect against that problem, we compute the 99.99999% confidence intervals around the PMI (Lin, 1999), and use the lower bound as a measure of association. $$$$$ For example, the following table shows the frequency count, mutual information (computed with the most likelihood estimation) and the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of the true mutual information: verb-object freq. mutual lower upper count info bound bound make difference 1489 2.928 2.876 2.978 make change 1779 2.194 2.146 2.239 Since the intervals are disjoint, the two collocations are considered to have significantly different mutual information values.
