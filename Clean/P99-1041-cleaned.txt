Minipar outputs dependency trees (Lin, 1999) from the input sentences. $$$$$ We parsed a 125-million word newspaper corpus with Minipar,1 a descendent of Principar (Lin, 1993; Lin, 1994), and extracted dependency relationships from the parsed corpus.

Dekang Lin proposes a way to automatically identify the noncompositionality of MWEs (Lin, 1999). $$$$$ For example, (Lin, 1998) compared automatically created thesaurus with the WordNet (Miller et a).., 1990) and Roget's Thesaurus.

Least mutual information difference with similar collocations $$$$$ For each marked pairs, the &quot;similar collocation&quot; column provides a similar collocation with a similar mutual information value (i.e., the reason why the pair is not consider to be non-compositional).
Least mutual information difference with similar collocations $$$$$ The method is based on the assumption that non-compositional phrases have a significantly different mutual information value than the phrases that are similar to their literal meanings.

Lin (1999) gave a corpus-based method for finding various types of non-compositional phrases, including the sort discussed in this paper. $$$$$ Less obviously, non-compositional expressions need to be treated differently than other phrases in many statistical or corpus-based NLP methods.

Recent work which attempts to discriminate between compositional and non-compositional MWEs include Lin (1999), who used mutual information measures identify such phrases, Bald win et al (2003), who compare the distribution of the head of the MWE with the distribution of the entire MWE, and Vallada Moiro and Tiedemann (2006), who use a word-alignment strategy to identify non-compositional MWEs making use of parallel texts. $$$$$ Not only many combinations are found in the corpus, many of them have very similar mutual information values to that of nomial distribution can be accurately approximated by a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993).

Inspired by Lin (1999), we examine the strength of association between the verb and noun constituents of the target combination and its variants, as an indirect cue to their idiomaticity. $$$$$ We examined three types of dependency relationships

Lin (1999) assumes that a target expression is non-compositional if and only if its (I) J+ value is significantly different from that of any of the variants. $$$$$ A phrase is probably non-compositional if such substitutions are not found in the collocation database or their mutual information values are significantly different from that of the phrase.

Second, some n-grams themselves carry no linguistic meaning; their phrase translations can be misleading, for example non-compositional phrases (Lin, 1999). $$$$$ In machine translation, word-for-word translation of non-compositional expressions can result in very misleading (sometimes laughable) translations.

To protect against that problem, we compute the 99.99999% confidence intervals around the PMI (Lin, 1999), and use the lower bound as a measure of association. $$$$$ Since our confidence of p falling between/.1/--V-In. is N%, we can have N% confidence that the true mutual information is within the upper and lower bound.

These properties can be used to identify potential idioms, for instance, by employing measures of association strength between the elements of an expression (Lin, 1999). $$$$$ It was also used to compute the distributional similarity between words (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998).

Lin (1999) defines a decision criterion for non compositional phrases based on the change in the mutual information of a phrase when substituting one word for a similar one based on an automatically constructed thesaurus. $$$$$ Our method is based on the hypothesis that when a phrase is non-composition, its mutual information differs significantly from the mutual informations of phrases obtained by substituting one of the word in the phrase with a similar word.
