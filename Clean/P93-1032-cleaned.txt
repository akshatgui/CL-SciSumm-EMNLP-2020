Our local language model approach also bears some resemblance to statistical approaches to modeling sub categorization frames (Manning, 1993). $$$$$ Automatic Acquisition Of A Large Sub Categorization Dictionary From Corpora

Our work differs from corpus-based work such as Manning (1993) or Kawahara and Kurohashi (2001) in that we are using existing lexical resources rather than a corpus. $$$$$ I have done some preliminary work to answer these questions.

Techniques for the automatic acquisition of subcategofization dictionaries have been developed by Manning (1993), Bfiscoe and Carroll (1997) and Carroll and Rooth (1998). $$$$$ Automatic Acquisition Of A Large Sub Categorization Dictionary From Corpora
Techniques for the automatic acquisition of subcategofization dictionaries have been developed by Manning (1993), Bfiscoe and Carroll (1997) and Carroll and Rooth (1998). $$$$$ While work has been done on various sorts of collocation information that can be obtained from text corpora, the only research that I am aware of that has dealt directly with the problem of the automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames is a series of papers by Brent (Brent and Berwick 1991, Brent 1991, Brent 1992).

This can be done automatically with unparsed corpora (Briscoe and Carroll 1997, Manning 1993, Ushioda et al 1993), from parsed corpora such as Marcus et al's (1993) Treebank (Merlo 1994, Framis 1994) or manually as was done for COMLEX (Macleod and Grishman 1994). $$$$$ Automatic Acquisition Of A Large Sub Categorization Dictionary From Corpora

Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular expressions that work on fiat tagged corpora instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us to gather information from larger corpora than have been done by the TreeBank project (see Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998). $$$$$ Automatic Acquisition Of A Large Sub Categorization Dictionary From Corpora
Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular expressions that work on fiat tagged corpora instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us to gather information from larger corpora than have been done by the TreeBank project (see Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998). $$$$$ Thus there is a need for a program that can acquire a subcategorization dictionary from on-line corpora of unrestricted text

This shows to which extent the range of arguments is fine grained, in contrast to other works where the range is at the categorial level, such as NP or PP (M. Brent 1993, C. Manning 1993, P. Merlo & M. Leybold 2001). $$$$$ For example, when the recorded subcategorization is NP PP(of), it is likely that the PP should actually be attached to the NP rather than the verb.

Both Brcnt (1993) and Manning (1993), who attempt to induce a lexicon of sub categorization features do so by completely discarding all preexisting knowledge; both systems are stand-ahmc, without a parsing engine to test or use the "learned" information. $$$$$ Automatic Acquisition Of A Large Sub Categorization Dictionary From Corpora

(Manning, 1993) observes that Brent's recognition technique is a rather simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detection, with a very high error rate. $$$$$ More recently, Brent (1992) substituted a very simple heuristic method to detect verbs (anything that occurs both with and without the suffix -ing in the text is taken as a potential verb, and every potential verb token is taken as an actual verb unless it is preceded by a determiner or a preposition other than to.4 This is a rather simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detection, with a very high error rate.
