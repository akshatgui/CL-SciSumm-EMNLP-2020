The (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) article considers a number of different figures of merit for ordering the agenda, and ultimately recommends one that reduces the number of edges required for a full parse into the thousands. $$$$$ Again, we measured the recall of the best parse of each sentence found within each number of edges.

(Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) and [Gold98] use a figure which indicates the merit of a given constituent or edge, relative only to itself and its children but independent of the progress of the parse we will call this the edge's independent merit (IM). $$$$$ Magerman and Marcus (1991) use the geometric mean to compute a figure of merit that is independent of constituent length.

Again it is reminiscent of a best-first parser (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) in the use of an agenda and a chart, but is fundamentally different due to the fact that there is no input order. $$$$$ However, the parser cannot compute the outside probability of a constituent during a parse, and so in order to use context on both sides of the constituent, we need to use something like our boundary statistics.

Chitrao and Grishman (1990), Caraballo and Charniak (1998), Charniak et al (1998), and Collins (1999) describe best-first parsing, which is intended for a tabular item-based framework. $$$$$ This can result in a &quot;thrashing&quot; effect as noted in Chitrao and Grishman (1990), where the system parses short constituents, even very low-probability ones, while avoiding combining them into longer constituents.

Best-first parsers deal with this by allowing an upward propagation, which updates such edges' scores (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ We strongly recommend this figure of merit as the basis for best-first statistical parsers.
Best-first parsers deal with this by allowing an upward propagation, which updates such edges' scores (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ These updates can be quite expensive in terms of CPU time.

To situate our results, the FOMs used by (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) require 10K edges to parse 96% of these sentences, while BF requires only 6K edges. $$$$$ Sentence length was limited to a maximum of 30 because of the huge number of edges that are generated in doing a full parse of long sentences; using this grammar, sentences in this length range have produced up to 130,000 edges.
To situate our results, the FOMs used by (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) require 10K edges to parse 96% of these sentences, while BF requires only 6K edges. $$$$$ Figure 13 shows the percentage of sentences of length 18 through 26 for which a parse could be found within 2,500 edges.

Therefore, we were less concerned with improving efficiency, and more with the properties of this algorithm, which we consider a baseline method upon which more sophisticated techniques such as best-first parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ Chart parsing is a commonly used algorithm for parsing natural language texts.
Therefore, we were less concerned with improving efficiency, and more with the properties of this algorithm, which we consider a baseline method upon which more sophisticated techniques such as best-first parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ We then computed several quantities for best-first parsing with each figure of merit at the point where the best-first parsing method has found parses contributing at least 95% of the probability mass of the sentence.

Similar to a best-first parser (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998), the highest scored hypothesis is expanded first. $$$$$ The treebank grammar was introduced in Charniak (1996), and the parser in, that paper is a best-first parser using the boundary trigram figure of merit.
Similar to a best-first parser (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998), the highest scored hypothesis is expanded first. $$$$$ They do not actually incorporate this figure into a best-first parser.

For efficiency reasons, we use a coarse-to-fine pruning scheme like that of Caraballo and Charniak (1998). $$$$$ Ideally, we would like to use as our figure of merit the conditional probability of that constituent, given the entire sentence, in order to choose a constituent that not only appears likely in isolation, but is most likely given the sentence as a whole; that is, we would like to pick the constituent that maximizes the following quantity

It might be used to rapidly compute approximate outside-probability estimates to prioritize best-first search (e.g., Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ The following recursive formula can be used to compute aL.
It might be used to rapidly compute approximate outside-probability estimates to prioritize best-first search (e.g., Caraballo and Charniak, 1998). $$$$$ We compute estimates of the inside probability for each proposed constituent incrementally as new constituents are added to the chart.

A quite different approach to parsing efficiency is taken in Caraballo and Charniak (1998). $$$$$ One approach is to take the geometric mean of the inside probability, to obtain a per-word inside probability.
A quite different approach to parsing efficiency is taken in Caraballo and Charniak (1998). $$$$$ Magerman and Weir (1992) use a similar model with a different parsing algorithm.

The results cited in Caraballo and Charniak (1998) can not be compared directly to ours, but are roughly in the same equivalence class. $$$$$ The boundary statistics were counted directly from the training data as well.

The standard methods of the best analysis selection (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) usually use simple stochastic functions independent on the peculiarities of the underlying language. $$$$$ Best-first parsing methods for natural language try to parse efficiently by considering the most likely constituents first.
