We also analyze the labeled corpus for opinion expressions and observe that many opinion expressions are used in multiple domains, which is identical with the conclusion presented by Kobayashiet al (2007). $$$$$ The technology of opinion extraction allowsusers to retrieve and analyze people?s opinions scattered over Web documents.

In (Kobayashi et al 2007), a pattern mining method was used. $$$$$ This direction has been form ing the mainstream of research on opinion-sensitive text processing (Pang et al, 2002; Turney, 2002, etc.).

Kobayashi et al (2007) adopted a supervised learning technique to search for useful syntactic patterns as contextual clues. $$$$$ We focus on two important subtasks of opinion extraction
