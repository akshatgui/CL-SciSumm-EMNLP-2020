We also analyze the labeled corpus for opinion expressions and observe that many opinion expressions are used in multiple domains, which is identical with the conclusion presented by Kobayashiet al (2007). $$$$$ The technology of opinion extraction allowsusers to retrieve and analyze people?s opinions scattered over Web documents.

 $$$$$ Compared with extrac tion from review articles, extraction from weblogs is more challenging because weblog posts tend toexhibit greater diversity in topics, goals, vocabulary, style, etc. and are much more likely to include descriptions irrelevant to the subject in question.

In (Kobayashi et al 2007), a pattern mining method was used. $$$$$ Extracting Aspect-Evaluation and Aspect-Of Relations in Opinion Mining
In (Kobayashi et al 2007), a pattern mining method was used. $$$$$ This direction has been form ing the mainstream of research on opinion-sensitive text processing (Pang et al, 2002; Turney, 2002, etc.).

Kobayashi et al (2007) adopted a supervised learning technique to search for useful syntactic patterns as contextual clues. $$$$$ We focus on two important subtasks of opinion extraction: (a) extracting aspect-evaluationrelations, and (b) extracting aspect-of re lations, and we approach each task usingmethods which combine contextual and sta tistical clues.
Kobayashi et al (2007) adopted a supervised learning technique to search for useful syntactic patterns as contextual clues. $$$$$ Furthermore, we also show that combin ing contextual clues with a common co-occurrencestatistics-based technique for bridging reference resolution makes a significant improvement on aspect of relation extraction.
