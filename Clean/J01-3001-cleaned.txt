Stevenson and Wilks (2001) propose a somewhat related technique to handle WSD, based on integrating LDOCE classes with simulated annealing. $$$$$ Others, such as Harley and Glennon (1997) and ourselves Wilks and Stevenson (1998a, 1998b; Stevenson and Wilks 1999), have concentrated on approaches that disambiguate all content words.'

Stevenson and Wilks (2001) investigated the interaction of knowledge sources, such as part-of-speech, dictionary definition, subject codes, etc. on WSD. $$$$$ Stevenson and Wilks Interaction of Knowledge Sources in WSD Partial disambiguation (by part of speech): If there is more than one possible homograph with the correct part of speech but some have been removed from consideration, that word has been partially disambiguated by part of speech.

However, they are quite rare, even in monolingual contexts (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001, e.g.), and they are not able to integrate and use knowledge coming from corpus and other resources during the learning process. $$$$$ Others, such as Harley and Glennon (1997) and ourselves Wilks and Stevenson (1998a, 1998b; Stevenson and Wilks 1999), have concentrated on approaches that disambiguate all content words.'

 $$$$$ The relative performance of the baseline method (choosing the first sense) compared to the reported algorithm (removing homographs using part-of-speech tags) are shown in the rightmost two columns.

However, there has been no direct comparison of which knowledge sources are the most useful or whether combining a variety of knowledge sources, a strategy which has been shown to be successful for WSD in the general domain (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001), improves results. $$$$$ Combining knowledge sources for WSD is not a new idea; in this section we will review some of the systems which have tried to do that.

In the hybrid approaches that have been explored so far, deep knowledge, like selectional preferences, is either pre-processed into a vector representation to accommodate machine learning algorithms, or used in previous steps to filter out possible senses e.g. (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001). $$$$$ Our next partial tagger returns the set of senses for each word that is licensed by selectional preferences (in the sense of Wilks 1975).

We refer to this method as stacking, and it has been previously used to integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources for WSD (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001). $$$$$ Each of these knowledge sources has been used for WSD and in Section 3 we describe a method which performs rough-grained disambiguation using part-of-speech information.

POS tags of the focus word itself are also included, to aid sense disambiguations related to syntactic differences (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001). $$$$$ Others, such as Harley and Glennon (1997) and ourselves Wilks and Stevenson (1998a, 1998b; Stevenson and Wilks 1999), have concentrated on approaches that disambiguate all content words.'
POS tags of the focus word itself are also included, to aid sense disambiguations related to syntactic differences (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001). $$$$$ Disambiguation makes use of several knowledge sources: frequency information, syntactic tags, morphological information, semantic context (clusters), collocations and word associations, role-related expectations, and selectional restrictions.

Prior research (e.g., (McRoy, 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001), (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002)) suggests that use of both syntactic and lexical features will improve disambiguation accuracies. $$$$$ Ng and Lee (1996) explored an approach to WSD in which a word is assigned the sense of the most similar example already seen.
