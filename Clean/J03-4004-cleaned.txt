Selectional preferences do not only play an important role in human sentence processing (McRae et al, 1998), but are also helpful for NLP tasks like word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ Selectional preferences have been used by word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems as one source of disambiguating information.

Attention has mostly been limited to selectional preferences of verbs, which have been used for example for syntactic disambiguation (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). $$$$$ Selectional preferences have been used by word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems as one source of disambiguating information.

In computational linguistics, a multitude of tasks is sensitive to selectional preferences, such as the resolution of ambiguous attachments (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003), semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), or testing the applicability of inference rules (Pantel et al, 2007). $$$$$ Selectional preferences have been used by word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems as one source of disambiguating information.

Note that these are the two extremes of semantic granularity in WordNet, and we plan to experiment with intermediate representation levels in future research (c.f. Li and Abe (1998), McCarthy and Carroll (2003), Xiong et al (2005), Fujita et al (2007)). $$$$$ The first application is text simplification, as outlined by Carroll, Minnen, Pearce et al. (1999).

Agirre and Martinez (2001) and Zheng et al (2007) adopted the Class-only Model in research, while in McCarthy and Carroll (2003) and Merlo and Stevenson (2001) the Word-Class Model is employed. $$$$$ Previously, we evaluated noun and verb disambiguation on the English all-words task in the SENSEVAL-2 exercise (Cotton et al. 2001).

McCarthy and Carroll (2003) reports that the Word-Class Model performs well in unsupervised WSD. $$$$$ The parser uses a wide-coverage unification-based shallow grammar of English POS tags and punctuation (Briscoe and Carroll 1995) and performs disambiguation using a context-sensitive probabilistic model (Briscoe and Carroll 1993), recovering from extra-grammaticality by returning partial parses.
McCarthy and Carroll (2003) reports that the Word-Class Model performs well in unsupervised WSD. $$$$$ We would expect that WSD results using selectional preferences would be better for the latter class of verbs.

One known unsupervised learning approach for WSD in SP is McCarthy and Carroll (2003) which addresses the issue via conditional probability. $$$$$ Although the preferences perform well in comparison with other unsupervised WSD systems on the same corpus, the results show that for many applications, further knowledge sources would be required to achieve an adequate level of accuracy and coverage.

The approach is also used in (McCarthy and Carroll 2003) to disambiguate verbs and adjectives in collocations. $$$$$ The selectional preferences are specific to verb or adjective classes, rather than individual word forms, so they can be used to disambiguate the co-occurring adjectives and verbs, rather than just the nominal argument heads.

To be particular, the method used by McCarthy and Carroll (2003) is formula (6). $$$$$ We set the threshold by examining a plot of BNC frequency and the percentage of verbs at particular frequencies that are not listed in WordNet (Figure 2).

For example: McCarthy and Carroll (2003) use Li and Abe's method in a word sense disambiguation setting; Schulteim Walde et al (2008) use their MDL approach as part of a system for syntactic and semantic subcategorisation frame learning; Shutova (2010) deploys Resnik's method for metaphor interpretation. $$$$$ Li and Abe used TCMs for the task of structural disambiguation.

McCarthy and Carroll (2003) also use an unsupervised approach and grammatical relations to learn selectional preferences for word classes. $$$$$ There is a significant limitation to the word tokens that can be disambiguated using selectional preferences, in that they are restricted to those that occur in the specified grammatical relations and in argument head position.

The most similar approach to the one we describe, that has been tested on Senseval-2, is the one described in (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003). $$$$$ Thus AC = {ac E WordNet adjective synsets linked by similar-to}.
