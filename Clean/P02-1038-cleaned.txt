An alternate way to optimize weights over translation features is described in Och and Ney (2002). $$$$$ For example, using a function k(·) that counts how many verb groups exist in the source or the target sentence, we can define the following feature, which is 1 if each of the two sentences contains the same number of verb groups: In the same way, we can introduce semantic features or pragmatic features such as the dialogue act classification.
