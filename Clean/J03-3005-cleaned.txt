Following the methodology in Keller and Lapata (2003), we divide the verbs into four frequency bands, frequency being absolute number of annotated sentences $$$$$ Again, proper nouns and low-frequency nouns were discarded from this list.
Following the methodology in Keller and Lapata (2003), we divide the verbs into four frequency bands, frequency being absolute number of annotated sentences $$$$$ Here, the conditional probability model reached a performance of 83.9% correct on the low-frequency data set.

Keller and Lapata (2003) showed that web frequencies correlate reliably with standard corpus frequencies. $$$$$ For the seen bigrams, we showed that the Web frequencies correlate better with judged plausibility than corpus frequencies.
Keller and Lapata (2003) showed that web frequencies correlate reliably with standard corpus frequencies. $$$$$ We found that Web frequencies and re-created frequencies are reliably correlated, and that Web frequencies are better at predicting plausibility judgments than smoothed frequencies.

We used the log of the web counts returned, as recommended in previous work (Keller and Lapata, 2003). $$$$$ Previous work has demonstrated that corpus counts correlate with human plausibility judgments for adjective-noun bigrams.
We used the log of the web counts returned, as recommended in previous work (Keller and Lapata, 2003). $$$$$ For seen and unseen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the two sets of plausibility judgments collected by Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999) and Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001), respectively.

The Web has already been used successfully for a series of NLP tasks such as Mt (Grefenstette, 1999), word sense disambiguation (Agirre and Martinez, 2000), synonym recognition (Turney, 2001), anaphora resolution (Modjeska et al, 2003) and determining frequencies for unseen bi-grams (Keller and Lapata, 2003). $$$$$ Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) use the Web for word sense disambiguation, Volk (2001) proposes a method for resolving PP attachment ambiguities based on Web data, Markert, Nissim, and Modjeska (2003) use the Web for the resolution of nominal anaphora, and Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) use Web-based n-gram counts to improve language modeling.

Thus, the frequency of appearance of n-grams on the Web (via the Google search engine) appears as a good indicator of the n-gram popularity/soundness (Keller and Lapata, 2003). $$$$$ Keller and Lapata Web Frequencies for Unseen Bigrams Another source of noise is the fact that Google (but not AltaVista) will sometimes return pages that do not include the search term at all.
Thus, the frequency of appearance of n-grams on the Web (via the Google search engine) appears as a good indicator of the n-gram popularity/soundness (Keller and Lapata, 2003). $$$$$ The difference in correlation coefficients was not significant for noun-noun and verb-object bigrams, for either search engine.

More recently, Keller and Lapata (2003) evaluate the utility of using Web search engines for obtaining frequencies for unseen bigrams. $$$$$ Using The Web To Obtain Frequencies For Unseen Bigrams
More recently, Keller and Lapata (2003) evaluate the utility of using Web search engines for obtaining frequencies for unseen bigrams. $$$$$ For both seen and unseen bigrams, there was only a very small difference between the correlation coefficients obtained with the two search engines.

See Keller and Lapata (2003) for more issues. $$$$$ This result holds both for seen bigrams (Lapata, McDonald, and Keller 1999) and for unseen bigrams whose counts have been re-created using smoothing techniques (Lapata, Keller, and McDonald 2001).

The findings described in (Keller and Lapata, 2003) seem to suggest that count estimations we need in the present study over Subject-Verb bigrams are highly correlated to corpus counts. $$$$$ We found that the counts obtained from the Web are highly correlated with the counts obtained from the BNC.

The performance is similar to other published results like those by Keller and Lapata (2003), who adopted a similar feature set and reported around 75% success rates on the ACE data set. $$$$$ A similar picture was observed for the NANTC counts.

It has been shown that web documents (as Wikipedia) are reliable samples of language (Keller and Lapata, 2003). $$$$$ Other samples of spoken language are also included, ranging from business or government meetings to radio shows and phoneins.

 $$$$$ From these data, we computed the average factor by which the Web counts are larger than the BNC counts.

Recall that even the Keller and Lapata (2003) system, built on the world's largest corpus, achieves only 34% recall (Table 1) (with only 48% of positives and 27% of all pairs previously observed, but see Footnote 5). $$$$$ Recall that the NANTC is 3.5 times larger than the BNC, which does not seem to be enough to substantially mitigate data sparseness.

The web as a corpus has been successfully used for many areas in NLP (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003) such as WSD (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999), obtaining frequencies for bigrams (Keller and Lapata 2003) and noun compound bracketing (Nakov and Hearst 2005). $$$$$ For seen and unseen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the two sets of plausibility judgments collected by Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999) and Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001), respectively.

It is believed that the size of the web is thousands of times larger than normal large corpora, and the counts obtained from the web are highly correlated with the counts from large balanced corpora for predicate-argument bi-grams (Keller and Lapata, 2003). $$$$$ We found that Web counts were highly correlated with frequencies from two different corpora.

However, previous study (Keller and Lapata, 2003) reveals that the large amount of data available for the web counts could outweigh the noisy problems. $$$$$ We conclude that simple heuristics (see Section 2.3) are sufficient to obtain useful frequencies from the Web; it seems that the large amount of data available for Web counts outweighs the associated problems (noisy, unbalanced, etc.).
