There are various data-driven approaches to this NLP-task (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), but they usually focus on lexical paraphrases and do not address the problem of sentence splitting, either. $$$$$ Generating Phrasal and Sentential Paraphrases

Madnani and Dorr (2010) survey a variety of data driven paraphrasing techniques, categorizing them based on the type of data that they use. $$$$$ Generating Phrasal and Sentential Paraphrases

It could be applied to other data driven paraphrasing techniques (see Madnani and Dorr (2010) for a survey). $$$$$ Generating Phrasal and Sentential Paraphrases

Paraphrase generation, on the other hand, has been an area of active research and the related work has been thoroughly surveyed in Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) as well as in Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ In general, building paraphrase corpora, whether it is done at the sentence level or at the sub-sentential level, is extremely useful for the fostering of further research and development in the area of paraphrase generation.
Paraphrase generation, on the other hand, has been an area of active research and the related work has been thoroughly surveyed in Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) as well as in Madnani and Dorr (2010). $$$$$ We identify several such trends in the area of paraphrase generation that are gathering momentum.

A much more detailed discussion on the use of paraphrases and ways to extract them is given in (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ In fact, any given source sentence can often be translated into the target language in many valid ways.
A much more detailed discussion on the use of paraphrases and ways to extract them is given in (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ However, given the interesting and diverse work that has been done in both these areas, we feel that any significant discussion beyond the treatment above merits a separate, detailed survey.

See Madnani and Dorr (2010) for a good paraphrasing survey. $$$$$ Also note that we only discuss those paraphrasing techniques that can generate the types of paraphrases under examination in this survey

As Madnani and Dorr (Madnani and Dorr, 2010) suggested, it would be beneficial to the research community to develop a standard, shared evaluation that would act to catalyze further advances and encourage more meaningful comparative evaluations of such approaches moving forward. $$$$$ However, for other approaches that do not necessarily operate at the level of sentences and cannot produce any alignments, falling back on estimates of traditional formulations of precision and recall is suggested.
As Madnani and Dorr (Madnani and Dorr, 2010) suggested, it would be beneficial to the research community to develop a standard, shared evaluation that would act to catalyze further advances and encourage more meaningful comparative evaluations of such approaches moving forward. $$$$$ We also believe that a large-scale annual community-wide evaluation should become a trend since it is required to foster further research in, and use of, paraphrase extraction and generation.

they assume that the same paraphrase generation resources (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), for example paraphrasing rules, that some abstractive sentence compressors (including ours) use always produce acceptable paraphrases, which is not the case as discussed below. $$$$$ Since the evaluation of paraphrases is essentially the task of measuring semantic similarity or of paraphrase recognition, all of those metrics, including the ones discussed in Section 2, can be employed here.

Paraphrase generation methods that operate both on a single monolingual corpus or on parallel corpus are discussed by Madnani and Dorr 2010. $$$$$ The input corpus is usually a single or set of monolingual corpora (parallel or non-parallel).
Paraphrase generation methods that operate both on a single monolingual corpus or on parallel corpus are discussed by Madnani and Dorr 2010. $$$$$ In this section, we concentrate on paraphrase generation methods that operate on a single monolingual corpus.

Synonym extraction (Wu and Zhou, 2003), lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007) and paraphrasing (Madnani and Dorr, 2010) are related to collocation correction in the sense that they try to find semantically equivalent words or phrases. $$$$$ Using bilingual parallel corpora for paraphrasing has the inherent advantage that sentences in the other language are exactly semantically equivalent to sentences in the intended paraphrasing language.

Because equivalence is the most fundamental semantic relationship, techniques for generating and recognizing paraphrases play an important role in a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ Moreover, the task of automatically generating or extracting semantic equivalences for the various units of language— words, phrases, and sentences—is an important part of natural language processing (NLP) and is being increasingly employed to improve the performance of several NLP applications.
Because equivalence is the most fundamental semantic relationship, techniques for generating and recognizing paraphrases play an important role in a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ The task of recognizing entailment is an application-independent task and has important ramifications for almost all other language processing tasks that can derive benefit from some form of applied semantic inference.

Data-driven paraphrase acquisition techniques can be categorized by the type of data that they use (Madnani and Dorr,2010). $$$$$ Generating Phrasal and Sentential Paraphrases

A detailed survey of paraphrase generation techniques can be found in (Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis, 2010) and (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ We also discuss the strategies used for evaluating paraphrase generation techniques and briefly explore some future trends in paraphrase generation.

Sub-sentential paraphrases can be acquired from text pairs expressing the same meaning (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ Two examples of such applications are text-to-text generation and information extraction.
Sub-sentential paraphrases can be acquired from text pairs expressing the same meaning (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). $$$$$ As far as the quality of acquired paraphrases is concerned, this approach easily outperforms almost all other sentential paraphrasing approaches surveyed in this article.

Over the years, paraphrase acquisition and generation have attracted a wealth of research works that are too many to adequatly summarize here $$$$$ Algorithm 4 shows some details of how their technique works.

The wide variety of techniques for acquiring phrasal paraphrases, which can subsequently be used by text paraphrasing techniques (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), the inherent polysemy of such linguistic units and the pragmatic constraints on their uses make it impossible to ensure that potential paraphrase pairs will be substitutable in any context, an observation which was already made at a lexical level (Zhao et al., 2007). $$$$$ Before describing the techniques used for paraphrasing, it is essential to examine the broader context of the application of paraphrases.

(2007).

The acquisition of sub-sentential paraphrases has attracted a lot of attention recently (Madnani and Dorr,2010). $$$$$ In this survey, we will be restricting our discussion to only automatic acquisition of phrasal paraphrases (including paraphrastic patterns) and on generation of sentential paraphrases.
The acquisition of sub-sentential paraphrases has attracted a lot of attention recently (Madnani and Dorr,2010). $$$$$ Madnani et al. (2008a) combine the pivot-based approach to paraphrase acquisition with a well-defined English-to-English translation model that is then used in an (unmodified) SMT system, yielding sentential paraphrases by means of “translating” input English sentences.
