The recent advances in parsing have achieved parsers with O(n3) time complexity without the grammar constant (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ Yet, they can be parsed in O(n3) time (Eisner, 1996).
The recent advances in parsing have achieved parsers with O(n3) time complexity without the grammar constant (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ Furthermore, there is a large grammar constant, which is typically in the thousands for treebank parsers.

A dependency-based system using MST Parser (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ We present a new approach to training dependency parsers, based on the online large-margin learning algorithms of Crammer and Singer (2003) and Crammer et al. (2003).
A dependency-based system using MST Parser (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ The Czech parser of Collins et al. (1999) was run on a different data set and most other dependency parsers are evaluated using English.

This may be partially compensated for by including features about the surrounding words (McDonald et al., 2005), but any feature templates which would be identical across the two contexts will be in tension. $$$$$ Dependency trees capture important aspects of functional relationships between words and have been shown to be useful in many applications including relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), paraphrase acquisition (Shinyama et al., 2002) and machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005).

(2004) formulate the parsing problem in the large-margin structured classification setting (Taskar et al., 2003), but are limited to parsing sentences of 15 words or less due to computation time.

Many of the features above were introduced in McDonald et al (2005a); specifically, the node type, inside, and edge features. $$$$$ These features represent a system of backoff from very specific features over words and partof-speech tags to less sparse features over just partof-speech tags.
Many of the features above were introduced in McDonald et al (2005a); specifically, the node type, inside, and edge features. $$$$$ Features of the first type look at words that occur between a child and its parent.

In turn, those features were inspired by successful previous work in first order dependency parsing (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ The following work on dependency parsing is most relevant to our research.
In turn, those features were inspired by successful previous work in first order dependency parsing (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ We described a successful new method for training dependency parsers.

Although (McDonald et al, 2005) used the prefix of each word form instead of word form itself as features, character-level features here for Chinese is essentially different from that. $$$$$ These features are added for both the entire words as well as the 5-gram prefix if the word is longer than 5 characters.

The latest state-of-the-art statistical dependency parsers are discriminative, meaning that they are based on classifiers trained to score trees, given a sentence, either via factored whole-structure scores (McDonald et al, 2005a) or local parsing decision scores (Hall et al, 2006). $$$$$ Discriminatively trained parsers that score entire trees for a given sentence have only recently been investigated (Riezler et al., 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004; Collins and Roark, 2004; Taskar et al., 2004).

The solution to the conditionalization problem is given in Section 3, using a widely-known but newly-applied Matrix Tree Theorem due to Tutte (1984), and experimental results are presented with a comparison to the MIRA learning algorithm used by McDonald et al (2005a). $$$$$ All the experiments presented here use k = 5.

Most recently, McDonald et al (2005) have implemented a dependency parser with good accuracy (it is almost as good at dependency parsing as Charniak (2000)) and very impressive speed (it is about ten times faster than Collins (1997) and four times faster than Charniak (2000)). $$$$$ The best phrase-structure parsing models represent generatively the joint probability P(x, y) of sentence x having the structure y (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).

We used CoNLL 03 data (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) for NER, and the Penn Treebank (PTB) III corpus (Marcus et al, 1994) converted to dependency trees for DEPAR (McDonald et al, 2005). $$$$$ A more common approach is to factor the structure of the output space to yield a polynomial set of local constraints (Taskar et al., 2003; Taskar et al., 2004).
