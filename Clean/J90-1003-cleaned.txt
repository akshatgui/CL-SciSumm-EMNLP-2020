In (Church and Hanks, 1990) the significance of an association (x, y) is measured by the mutual information I (x, y) ,i.e. the probability of observing x and y together, compared with the probability of observing x and y independently. $$$$$ What is &quot;mutual information?&quot; According to Fano (1961), if two points (words), x and y, have probabilities P(x) and P(y), then their mutual information, I(x,y), is defined to be Informally, mutual information compares the probability of observing x and y together (the joint probability) with the probabilities of observing x and y independently (chance).

In this equation, pmi (i, p) is the pointwise mutual information score (Church and Hanks, 1990) between a pattern, p (e.g. consist-of), and a tuple, i (e.g. engine-car), and maxpmi is the maximum PMI score between all patterns and tuples. $$$$$ But on the other hand, the objective score can be misleading.

To this end we follow the method introduced by (Church and Hanks, 1990), i.e. by sliding a window of a given size over some texts. $$$$$ Joint probabilities, P(x,y), are estimated by counting the number of times that xis followed by y in a window of w words,f,(x,y), and normalizing by N.

Computational linguists have demonstrated that a word's meaning is captured to some extent by the distribution of words and phrases with which it commonly co-occurs (Church and Hanks, 1990). $$$$$ If x and y are in complementary distribution, then P(x,y) will be much less than P(x) P(y), forcing I(x,y) « 0.
