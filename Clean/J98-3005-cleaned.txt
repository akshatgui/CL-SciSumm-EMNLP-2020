For examples of work in producing abstract-like summaries, see Radev and McKeown (1998), which combines work in information extraction and natural language processing. $$$$$ In this section, we first present work on sentence extraction, next turn to work on identifying information in an article that should appear in a summary, and conclude with work on generation of summaries from data, showing how this task differs from the more general language generation task.

Radev and McKeown (1998) point out when summarizing interesting news events from multiple sources, one can expect reports with contradictory and redundant information. $$$$$ Given the omnipresence of on-line news services, one can expect that any interesting news event will be covered by several, if not most of them.
Radev and McKeown (1998) point out when summarizing interesting news events from multiple sources, one can expect reports with contradictory and redundant information. $$$$$ For example, if two sources of information report a different number of casualties in a particular incident, SUMMONS will report the contradiction and attribute the contradictory information to its sources, rather than select one of the contradictory pieces without the other.

Notable systems are SUMMONS (Radev and McKeown, 1998). $$$$$ We present a system, called SUMMONS' (McKeown and Radev 1995; Radev 1996; Radev and McKeown 1997), shown in Figure 1, which introduces novel techniques in the following areas

While template-based representations have been proposed for information merging in the past (Radev and McKeown, 1998), they considered only domain-specific scenarios. $$$$$ If the summarization system can find the needed information in other on-line sources, then it can produce an improved summary by merging information extracted from the input articles with information from the other sources (Radev and McKeown 1997).

the main previous body of work on biographical summarization is that of (Radev and McKeown 1998). $$$$$ We present a system, called SUMMONS' (McKeown and Radev 1995; Radev 1996; Radev and McKeown 1997), shown in Figure 1, which introduces novel techniques in the following areas

This is particularly problematic in the case of multi-document summarization, where sentences extracted from related documents are very likely to express similar information in different ways (Radev and McKeown, 1998). $$$$$ The extracted sentences fit together only in the case they are adjacent in the source document.

Existing work in abstractive summarization has been quite limited and can be categorized into two categories $$$$$ We present a system, called SUMMONS' (McKeown and Radev 1995; Radev 1996; Radev and McKeown 1997), shown in Figure 1, which introduces novel techniques in the following areas

Since data producing these summaries can be sourced in different documents, summary fusion techniques as proposed in (Radev and McKeown, 1998) can be employed. $$$$$ We present a system, called SUMMONS' (McKeown and Radev 1995; Radev 1996; Radev and McKeown 1997), shown in Figure 1, which introduces novel techniques in the following areas

Since (Radev and McKeown, 1998) describes the summary fusion mechanisms, Class 3 of questions can be reduced in this paper to Class 2, which deals with the processing of the template. $$$$$ We present a system, called SUMMONS' (McKeown and Radev 1995; Radev 1996; Radev and McKeown 1997), shown in Figure 1, which introduces novel techniques in the following areas

(Radev and McKeown, 1998) and (Harabagiu and Lacatusu, 2004) define agreement (when two sources report the same information), addition (when a second source reports additional information), contradiction (when two sources report conflicting information). $$$$$ For example, if two sources of information report a different number of casualties in a particular incident, SUMMONS will report the contradiction and attribute the contradictory information to its sources, rather than select one of the contradictory pieces without the other.
(Radev and McKeown, 1998) and (Harabagiu and Lacatusu, 2004) define agreement (when two sources report the same information), addition (when a second source reports additional information), contradiction (when two sources report conflicting information). $$$$$ When two sources report conflicting information about the same event, a contradiction arises.

Recently, advanced QA systems defined relationships (equivalence, contradiction, ...) between Web page extracts or texts containing possible answers in order to combine them and to produce a single answer (Radev and McKeown, 1998), (Harabagiu and Lacatusu, 2004), (Webber et al., 2002). $$$$$ ZEDDoc (Passormeau et al. 1997; Kukich et al.
