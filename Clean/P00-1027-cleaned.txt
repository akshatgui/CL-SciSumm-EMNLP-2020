Also, Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) obtained outstanding results at inducing English past tense after beginning with a list of the open class roots in the language, a table of a language's inflectional parts of speech, and the canonical suffixes for each part of speech. $$$$$ In further clarification of the task description, the morphological induction described in this paper assumes, and is based on, only the following limited set of (often optional) available resources: (a) A table (such as Table 2) of the inflectional parts of speech of the given language, along with a list of the canonical suffixes for each part of speech.

For the future, we expect improvements could be derived by coupling this work, which focuses primarily on inducing regular morphology, with that of Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), who assume some information about regular morphology in order to induce irregular morphology. $$$$$ However, handling of irregular words was largely excluded from this work, as Goldsmith assumed a strictly concatenative morphology without models for stem changes.

Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) propose an algorithm that extracts morphological rules relating roots and inflected forms of verbs (but the algorithm can be extended to other morphological relations). $$$$$ This paper presents an original and successful algorithm for the nearly unsupervised induction of inflectional morphological analyzers, with a focus on highly irregular forms not typically handled by other morphology induction algorithms.
Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) propose an algorithm that extracts morphological rules relating roots and inflected forms of verbs (but the algorithm can be extended to other morphological relations). $$$$$ This paper has presented an original algorithm capable of inducing the accurate morphological analysis of even highly irregular verbs, starting with no paired <inflection,root> examples for training and no prior seeding of legal morphological transformations.

Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) report an accuracy of over 99% for their best model and a test set of 3888 pairs. $$$$$ However, the hypothesis that these measures model independent and complementary evidence sources is supported by the roughly additive combined accuracy of 71.6%.8 The final performance of the full converged CS+FS+LS+MS model at 99.2% accuracy on the full test set, and 99.7% accuracy on inflections requiring analysis beyond simple concatenative suffixation, is quite remarkable given that the algorithm had absolutely no <inflection,root> examples as training data, and had no prior inventory of stem changes available, with only a slight statistical bias in favor of shorter stem changes with smaller Levenshtein distance, and with the minimal search-simplifying assumption in all the models that candidate alignments must begin with a the same VC * prefix.9 Given a starting point where all single character X-+17 changes at the point of suffixation are equally likely, the processes of elison (e-+e), gemination (e.g.
Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) report an accuracy of over 99% for their best model and a test set of 3888 pairs. $$$$$ Although they don't breakdown this performance by word type, their included FOILDL program trained from 250 pairs and applied to our evaluation set achieved 100% accuracy on the pairs with simple +ed concatenation, 84% accuracy on stem changing (non-concat) pairs and 5% accuracy on the highly irregular pairs, with 89% overall accuracy.

From the point of view of the evaluation of the algorithm, we should design an assessment scheme that would make our experimental results more directly comparable to those of Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), Schone and Jurafsky (2000) and others. $$$$$ Other available supervised learning results (e.g.

The development of the WordFrame model was motivated by work originally presented in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000). $$$$$ Brent (1993, 1999), de Marcken (1995), Kazakov (1997) and Goldsmith (2000) have each focused on the problem of unsupervised learning of morphological systems as essentially a segmentation task, yielding a morphologically plausible and statistically motivated partition of stems and affixes.

The supervised morphological learner presented in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) modeled lemmatization as a word-final stem change plus a suffix taken from a (possibly empty) list of potential suffixes. $$$$$ Minimally Supervised Morphological Analysis By Multimodal Alignment
The supervised morphological learner presented in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) modeled lemmatization as a word-final stem change plus a suffix taken from a (possibly empty) list of potential suffixes. $$$$$ The final stem-change probabilities then are an interpolation with the trained model Pi and the initial baseline (P0) model described in Section 6.1: P( c —x 13 I root, suffix, POS) = Ai P0( a —x /3 I suffix) + (1 — Ai) Pi( a —x /3 I root, suffix, POS) The Levenshtein distance models are reestimated as observed in Section 5, while the context similarity model can be improved through better self-learned lemmatization of the modelled context words.

In Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), the end-of-string model is trained from inflection-root pairs acquired through unsupervised methods. $$$$$ First note that because the triple of <root> + <stemchange> + <suffix> uniquely determines a resulting inflection, one can effectively compute P(inflection I root, suffix, POS) by P(stemchange I root, suffix, POS), i.e. for any root=-ya, suffix=+o- and inflection=-0a, Using statistics such as shown in Table 7, it is thus possible to compute the generation (or alignment) probability for an inflection given root and suffix using the simple interpolated backoff model in (1) where Ai is a function of the relative sample size of the conditioning event, and lastk(root) indicates the final k characters of the root.

We propose no new solutions to handling irregular verb forms, but suggest using non-string-based techniques, such as those presented in (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000), (Baroni et al, 2002) and (Wicentowski, 2002). $$$$$ Voutilainen (1995) has approached this problem in a finitestate framework, and Hakkani-Thr et al.

Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) have developed a system that learns such rules given a preliminary morphological hypothesis and part of speech tags. $$$$$ These suffixes not only serve as mnemonic tags for the POS labels, but they can also be used to obtain a noisy set of candidate examples for each part of speech.' the given language is useful to the extraction of context similarity features.
Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) have developed a system that learns such rules given a preliminary morphological hypothesis and part of speech tags. $$$$$ This principle suggests that for a given part of speech, a root should not have more than one inflection nor should multiple inflections in the same part of speech share the same root.

Similarly as Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), we assume that, in any language, vowels are more mutable in inflection than consonants, thus for example replacing a for i is cheaper that replacing s by r. $$$$$ In morphological systems worldwide, vowels and vowel clusters are relatively mutable through morphological processes, while consonants generally tend to have a lower probability of change during inflection.

Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) use similar statistics to identify words related by inflection, but they gather their counts from a much smaller corpus. $$$$$ While the probabilistic analyzer trained in Step 2 remains useful for previously unseen words, such words are typically quite regular and most of the difficult substance of the lemmatization problem can often be captured by a large root+Posinflection mapping table and a simple transducer to handle residual forms.
Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) use similar statistics to identify words related by inflection, but they gather their counts from a much smaller corpus. $$$$$ To do so, we use simple non-parametric statistics to calculate the probability of a particularvBD ratio by examining how frequently other such ratios in a similar range have been seen in the corpus.
