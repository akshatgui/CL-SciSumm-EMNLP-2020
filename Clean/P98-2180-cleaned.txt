Others have automatically extracted attribute relations from dictionary definitions (Richardson et al, 1998), structured online sources such as Wikipedia info boxes, (Wu and Weld, 2007) and large-scale collections of high-quality tabular web data (Cafarella et al, 2008). $$$$$ Although there has been much research on the use of automatic methods for extracting information from dictionary definitions (e.g., Vossen 1995, Wilks et al. 1996), hand-coded knowledge bases, e.g.

The Mindnet is a general-purpose database of semantic information (Richardson et al 1998) that has been repurposed as the primary repository of translation information for MT applications. $$$$$ MindNet

MindNet (Richardson et al, 1998) is both an extraction methodology and a lexical ontology different from a word net since it was created automatically from a dictionary and its structure is based on such resources. $$$$$ Vanderwende (1996) describes in detail the methodology used in the extraction of the semantic relations comprising MindNet.
MindNet (Richardson et al, 1998) is both an extraction methodology and a lexical ontology different from a word net since it was created automatically from a dictionary and its structure is based on such resources. $$$$$ An extended semrel path is a path created from subpaths in two different inverted semrel structures.

 $$$$$ Semrel paths are automatically assigned weights that reflect their salience.
 $$$$$ As the systems for these languages mature, we will create corresponding MindNets, beginning, as we did in English, with the processing of machine-readable reference materials and then adding information gleaned from corpora.

Such an approach was taken by the MindNet project (Richardson et al, 1998). $$$$$ For additional details and background on the creation and use of MindNet, readers are referred to Richardson (1997), Vanderwende (1996), and Dolan et al. (1993).
Such an approach was taken by the MindNet project (Richardson et al, 1998). $$$$$ The larger contexts from which these relations have been taken have generally not been retained.

One early example was MindNet (Richardson et al, 1998), which was based on collecting 24 semantic role relations from MRDs such as the American Heritage Dictionary. $$$$$ As a lexical knowledge base constructed automatically from the definitions and example sentences in two machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs), MindNet embodies several features that distinguish it from prior work with MRDs.

Richardson et al (1998) describes how MindNet began as a lexical knowledge base containing LF-like structures that were produced automatically from the definitions and example sentences in machine-readable dictionaries. $$$$$ However, none of these has succeeded in producing the breadth of semantic relations across entire dictionaries that has been produced for MindNet.

Synonymy, hypernymy or meronymy fall clearly in this latter category, and well known resources like WordNet (Miller, 1995), EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) or MindNet (Richardson et al, 1998) contain them. $$$$$ WordNet (Miller et al. 1990), continue to be the focus of ongoing research.
