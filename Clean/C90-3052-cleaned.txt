Implementations of sorted feature formalisms such as TDL (Krieger and Schifer, 1994), ALE (Carpenter, 1993), CUF (DSrre and Dorna, 1993), TFS (Emele and Zajac, 1990) and others have been used successfully for the development and testing of large grammars and lexicons, but they may be too slow for actual use in applications 180 because they are generally built on top of Prolog or LISP, and can therefore not be as efficient as the built-in unification of Prolog. $$$$$ Typed Unification Grammars Martin C.

A more radical approach however rooted in the traditional model is to fully map the typed unification grammars [Emele and Zajac, 1990 on the SNAP. $$$$$ Typed Unification Grammars Martin C.

This gives the possibility to define more general relations, and in particular functions can be defined in a way similar to, for example, (Johnson and Rosner, 1989) and (Emele and Zajac, 1990). $$$$$ Unification of two types X and Y is defined .
