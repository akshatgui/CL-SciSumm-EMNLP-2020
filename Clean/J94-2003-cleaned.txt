Hence, the most important single construct of the centering model is the ordering of the list of forward-looking centers (Walker et al, 1994). $$$$$ Every element of the forward centers list, Cf(Ui), must be realized in Ui.

 $$$$$ RETAIN corresponds to a situation where the speaker is intending to SHIFT onto a new entity in the next utterance and is signalling this by realizing the current center in a lower ranked position on the Cf (examples follow below).

The BFP-algorithm (c.f. Walker et al (1994)) consists of three basic steps: 1 GENERATE possible Cb-Cf combinations. 2 FILTER by constraints, e.g., contra-indexing, sortal predicates, centering rules and constraints. 3 RANK by transition orderings. $$$$$ GENERATE possible Cb-Cf combinations FILTER by constraints, e.g.
