Hence, the most important single construct of the centering model is the ordering of the list of forward-looking centers (Walker et al, 1994). $$$$$ Every element of the forward centers list, Cf(Ui), must be realized in Ui.

 $$$$$ RETAIN corresponds to a situation where the speaker is intending to SHIFT onto a new entity in the next utterance and is signalling this by realizing the current center in a lower ranked position on the Cf (examples follow below).
