Sentiment lexicons such as SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al (2010)) and OpinionFinder (Wilson et al (2005a)) show low agreement rate with human, which is somewhat as expected: human judges in this study are labeling for subtle connotation, not for more explicit sentiment. $$$$$ 2.3.4 Sentiment Expression Classification The final component uses two classifiers to iden- tify words contained in phrases that express pos- itive or negative sentiments (Wilson et al., 2005).
