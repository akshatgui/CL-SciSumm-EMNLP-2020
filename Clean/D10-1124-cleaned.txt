Eisenstein et al (Eisenstein et al, 2010) show promising results in identifying an author's geographic location from micro-blogs, but the locations are coarse-grained and rely on a substantial message history per-source. $$$$$ Every message is tagged with a location, but most messages from a single individual tend to come from nearby locations (as they go about their day); for modeling purposes we use only a single geographic location for each author, simply taking the location of the first message in the sample.
Eisenstein et al (Eisenstein et al, 2010) show promising results in identifying an author's geographic location from micro-blogs, but the locations are coarse-grained and rely on a substantial message history per-source. $$$$$ More relevant is the work of Mei et al. (2006), in which the distribution over latent topics in blog posts is conditioned on the geographical location of the author.

For example, Eisenstein et al (2010) demonstrated a model that predicted where an author was located in order to analyze regional distinctions in communication. $$$$$ High-level topics such as “sports” or “entertainment” are rendered differently in each geographic region, revealing topic-specific regional distinctions.
For example, Eisenstein et al (2010) demonstrated a model that predicted where an author was located in order to analyze regional distinctions in communication. $$$$$ Each author is imbued with a latent “region” indicator, which both selects the regional variant of each topic, and generates the author’s observed geographical location.

Our dataset is derived from prior work in which we gathered the text and geographical locations of 9,250 microbloggers on the website twitter.com (Eisenstein et al, 2010). $$$$$ Our dataset is derived from the microblogging website Twitter,1 which permits users to post short messages to the public.

Many of these terms are non-standard; while space does not permit a complete glossary, some are defined in Table 4 or in our earlier work (Eisenstein et al, 2010). $$$$$ As in standard latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al., 2003), the base topics are selected by a per-token hidden variable z.
Many of these terms are non-standard; while space does not permit a complete glossary, some are defined in Table 4 or in our earlier work (Eisenstein et al, 2010). $$$$$ A large number of slang terms are found to have strong regional biases, suggesting that slang may depend on geography more than standard English does.

Mangoville and M2 are clubs in New York; fasho and coo were previously found to be strongly associated with the West Coast (Eisenstein et al., 2010). $$$$$ We hypothesize that geography and topic interact, as “pure” topical lexical distributions are corrupted by geographical factors; for example, a sports-related topic will be rendered differently in New York and California.
Mangoville and M2 are clubs in New York; fasho and coo were previously found to be strongly associated with the West Coast (Eisenstein et al., 2010). $$$$$ An active recent literature concerns geotagged information on the web, such as search queries (Backstrom et al., 2008) and tagged images (Crandall et al., 2009).

Eisenstein et al (2010) collected about 380,000 tweets from Twitter's official API. $$$$$ The main dataset in this research is gathered from the microblog website Twitter, via its official API.
Eisenstein et al (2010) collected about 380,000 tweets from Twitter's official API. $$$$$ We also filter to include only authors who follow fewer than 1,000 other people, and have fewer than 1,000 followers.

While the above approaches discretize the continuous surface of the earth, Eisenstein et al (2010) predict locations based on Gaussian distributions over the earth's surface as part of a hierarchical Bayesian model. $$$$$ We compare several approaches for predicting author location; we divide these into latent variable generative models and discriminative approaches.
While the above approaches discretize the continuous surface of the earth, Eisenstein et al (2010) predict locations based on Gaussian distributions over the earth's surface as part of a hierarchical Bayesian model. $$$$$ Both methods make predictions that are averaged across Earth’s surface requires computing or approximating the great circle distance – we use the Haversine formula (Sinnott, 1984).

Following Eisenstein et al (2010), we consider all tweets of a user concatenated as a single document, and use the earliest collected GPS-assigned location as the gold location. $$$$$ For each user’s Twitter feed, we combine all messages into a single “document.” We remove word types that appear in fewer than 40 feeds, yielding a vocabulary of 5,216 words.

Eisenstein et al (2010) investigate questions of dialectal differences and variation in regional interests in Twitter users using a collection of geotagged tweets. $$$$$ Many users of Twitter also supply exact geographical coordinates from GPS-enabled devices (e.g., mobile phones),2 yielding geotagged text data.
Eisenstein et al (2010) investigate questions of dialectal differences and variation in regional interests in Twitter users using a collection of geotagged tweets. $$$$$ Kwak et al. (2010) find dramatic shifts in behavior among users with social graph connectivity outside of that range; such users may be marketers, celebrities with professional publicists, news media sources, etc.

Eisenstein et al (2010) evaluate their geographic topic model by geolocating USA-based Twitter users based on their tweet content. $$$$$ We evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Performance is measured both on geo tagged Wikipedia articles (Overell, 2009) and tweets (Eisenstein et al, 2010). $$$$$ Within this paradigm, computational techniques are often applied to post hoc analysis

As a second evaluation corpus on a different domain, we use the corpus of geotagged tweets collected and used by Eisenstein et al (2010). $$$$$ Each document corresponds to the entire Twitter feed of a given author during the time period covered by our corpus.
As a second evaluation corpus on a different domain, we use the corpus of geotagged tweets collected and used by Eisenstein et al (2010). $$$$$ The prior a is the expected mean of each topic µ; for each term i, we set a(i) = log N(i) − log N, where N(i) is the total count of i in the corpus and N = Ei N(i).

For example, Eisenstein et al (2010) use Gaussian distributions to model the locations of Twitter users in the United States of America. $$$$$ The dataset covers each of the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia.
For example, Eisenstein et al (2010) use Gaussian distributions to model the locations of Twitter users in the United States of America. $$$$$ This model is equivalent to supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007)

Geographical region knowledge has also been considered in topic models (Eisenstein et al, 2010). $$$$$ We develop a model that incorporates two sources of lexical variation
