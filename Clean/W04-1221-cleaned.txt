Similarly, CRFs were employed by one system in isolation (Settles, 2004) and by another system in combination with SVMs (Song et al, 2004). $$$$$ CRFs are presented in more complete detail by Lafferty et al. (2001).
Similarly, CRFs were employed by one system in isolation (Settles, 2004) and by another system in combination with SVMs (Song et al, 2004). $$$$$ In a previous attempt to use a Hidden Markov Model to simultaneously recognize multiple biomedical entities (Collier et al., 2000), HMM performance for a particular entity seemed more or less proportional to its frequency in the data.

However, one participant (Settles, 2004) reported that their at tempt to utilize gazetteers (together with other resources) had failed in gaining better overall performance. $$$$$ I show that this approach can achieve an overall F1 measure around 70, which seems to be the current state of the art.

Settles (2004)'s CRF system deserves special note in the sense that it achieved comparable performance to top ranked systems with a rather simple feature set. $$$$$ Also of note is that, in both experiments, the CRF framework achieves somewhat comparable performance across all entities.
Settles (2004)'s CRF system deserves special note in the sense that it achieved comparable performance to top ranked systems with a rather simple feature set. $$$$$ I have shown that a CRF-based model with only simple orthographic features can achieve performance near the current state of the art, while using semantic lexicons (as presented here) do not positively affect performance.$ While the system presented here shows promise, there is still much to be explored.

While most of earlier approaches rely on handcrafted rules or dictionaries, many recent works adopt machine learning approaches ,e.g, SVM (Lee, 2003), HMM (Zhou, 2004), Maximum Entropy (Lin, 2004) and CRF (Settles,2004), especially with the availability of annotated corpora such as GENIA, achieving state-of-the-art performance. $$$$$ The system described here was developed as part of the BioNLP/NLPBA 2004 shared task.

Genes/Proteins are not the Same Many of the existing BNER systems, which are mainly tuned for gene/protein identification, use features such as token shape (also known as word class and brief word class (Settles, 2004)), Greek alphabet matching, Roman number matching and so forth. $$$$$ There is a similar “brief word class” feature which collapses consecutive identical characters into one.
Genes/Proteins are not the Same Many of the existing BNER systems, which are mainly tuned for gene/protein identification, use features such as token shape (also known as word class and brief word class (Settles, 2004)), Greek alphabet matching, Roman number matching and so forth. $$$$$ I prepared a total of 17 such lexicons, which include 7 that were entered by hand (Greek letters, amino acids, chemical elements, known viruses, plus abbreviations of all these), and 4 corresponding to genes, chromosome locations, proteins, and cell lines, drawn from online public databases (Cancer GeneticsWeb,2 BBID,3 SwissProt,4 and the Cell Line Database5).

(Settles, 2004) reported that a system using a subset of features out performed one using a full set of features. $$$$$ This paper presents a framework for simultaneously recognizing occurrences of PROTEIN, DNA, RNA, CELL-LINE, and CELL-TYPE entity classes using Conditional Random Fields with a variety of traditional and novel features.
(Settles, 2004) reported that a system using a subset of features out performed one using a full set of features. $$$$$ Two experiments were completed in the time allotted: one CRF model using only the orthographic features described in section 3.1, and a second system using all the semantic lexicons from 3.2 as well.

 $$$$$ The present model includes training vocabulary, 17 orthographic features based on regular expressions (e.g.

Our performance of the single-phase CRF with maximum likelihood training is 69.44%, which agrees with (Settles, 2004) who also uses similar settings. $$$$$ These weights are set to maximize the conditional log likelihood of labeled sequences in a training set D = f(o, l)(1), ... , (o, l)(n)�: When the training state sequences are fully labeled and unambiguous, the objective function is convex, thus the model is guaranteed to find the optimal weight settings in terms of LL(D).
Our performance of the single-phase CRF with maximum likelihood training is 69.44%, which agrees with (Settles, 2004) who also uses similar settings. $$$$$ The CRF can learn weights for these individual words, but it may help to build general, dynamic keyword lexicons that are associated with each label to assist in disambiguating between similar classes (and perhaps boost performance on low-frequency labels, such as RNA and CELL-LINE, for which training data are sparse).

The named entity tagger used throughout in this section is based on Conditional Random Fields and similar to the one presented by (Settles, 2004). $$$$$ In short, I have presented in detail a framework for recognizing multiple entity classes in biomedical abstracts with Conditional Random Fields.

Hence, the use of a named entity tagger supports the evaluation results when comparing the various biomedical entity recognition (Settles, 2004). $$$$$ Biomedical Named Entity Recognition Using Conditional Random Fields And Rich Feature Sets
