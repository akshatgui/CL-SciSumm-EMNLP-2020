To date, the most closely related work is Mihalcea et al (2007), which explores cross-lingual projections to generate subjectivity analysis resources in Romanian by leveraging on the tools and resources available in English. $$$$$ In this paper, we investigate methods to automatically generate resources for subjectivity analysis for a new target language by leveraging on the resources and tools available for English, which in many cases took years of work to complete.

In addition to the above methods for using English resources, the lexicon-based method investigated in Mihalcea et al (2007) can also use English resources by directly projecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons. $$$$$ This paper explores methods for generating subjectivity analysis resources in a new language by leveraging on the tools and resources available in English.
In addition to the above methods for using English resources, the lexicon-based method investigated in Mihalcea et al (2007) can also use English resources by directly projecting English lexicons into Chinese lexicons. $$$$$ Most of the research to date has focused on English, which is mainly explained by the availability of resources for subjectivity analysis, such as lexicons and manually labeled corpora.

Mihalcea et al (2007) learn multilingual subjectivity via cross-lingual projections. $$$$$ Learning Multilingual Subjective Language via Cross-Lingual Projections
Mihalcea et al (2007) learn multilingual subjectivity via cross-lingual projections. $$$$$ This motivates our exploration and use of cross-lingual lexicon translations and annotation projections.

Mihalcea et al (2007) propose a method to learn multilingual subjective language via cross-language projections. $$$$$ Learning Multilingual Subjective Language via Cross-Lingual Projections
Mihalcea et al (2007) propose a method to learn multilingual subjective language via cross-language projections. $$$$$ Note that, although we work with Romanian, the methods described are applicable to any other language, as in these experiments we (purposely) do not use any language-specific knowledge of the target language.

 $$$$$ Table 1 shows examples of entries in the Romanian lexicon, together with their corresponding original English form.
 $$$$$ A similar method can therefore be used to derive tools for subjectivity analysis in other languages.

Mihalcea et al (2007) propose two methods for translating sentiment lexicons. $$$$$ Automatic subjectivity analysis methods have been used in a wide variety of text processing applications, such as tracking sentiment timelines in online forums and news (Lloyd et al., 2005; Balog et al., 2006), review classification (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).
Mihalcea et al (2007) propose two methods for translating sentiment lexicons. $$$$$ For instance, the opinion tracking system Lydia (Lloyd et al., 2005) gives separate ratings for subjectivity and sentiment.

Some CLOA works used bilingual dictionaries (Mihalcea et al, 2007), or aligned corpus (Kim and Hovy, 2006) to align the expressions between source and target languages. $$$$$ While work on subjectivity analysis in other languages is growing (e.g., Japanese data are used in (Takamura et al., 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al., 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006)), much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data.

There is a growing number of methods that use data available in one language to build text processing tools for another language, for diverse tasks such as word sense disambiguation (Ng et al, 2003), syntactic parsing (Hwa et al, 2005), information retrieval (Monz and Dorr, 2005), subjectivity analysis (Mihalcea et al, 2007), and others. $$$$$ Automatic subjectivity analysis methods have been used in a wide variety of text processing applications, such as tracking sentiment timelines in online forums and news (Lloyd et al., 2005; Balog et al., 2006), review classification (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).

For instance, (Mihalcea et al, 2007) use an English corpus annotated for subjectivity along with parallel text to build a subjectivity classifier for Romanian. $$$$$ Second, can we derive subjectivity-annotated corpora in a new language using existing subjectivity analysis tools for English and a parallel corpus?
For instance, (Mihalcea et al, 2007) use an English corpus annotated for subjectivity along with parallel text to build a subjectivity classifier for Romanian. $$$$$ Ideally, one would generate an annotated Romanian corpus by translating English documents manually annotated for subjectivity such as the MPQA corpus.

Mihalcea et al (2007) and Banea et al (2008) proposed a number of approaches exploiting a bilingual dictionary, a parallel corpus, and an MT system to port the resources and systems available in English to languages with limited resources. $$$$$ We focus our experiments on Romanian, selected as a representative of the large number of languages that have only limited text processing resources developed to date.
Mihalcea et al (2007) and Banea et al (2008) proposed a number of approaches exploiting a bilingual dictionary, a parallel corpus, and an MT system to port the resources and systems available in English to languages with limited resources. $$$$$ In this paper, we described two approaches to generating resources for subjectivity annotations for a new language, by leveraging on resources and tools available for English.

For subjectivity lexicons translation, Mihalcea et al (2007) and Wan (2008) used the first sense in a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ Second, neither the lexicon nor the bilingual dictionary provides information on the sense of the individual entries, and therefore the translation has to rely on the most probable sense in the target language.
For subjectivity lexicons translation, Mihalcea et al (2007) and Wan (2008) used the first sense in a bilingual dictionary. $$$$$ On the other hand, the bilingual dictionary does not make this distinction, and therefore we have again to rely on the “most frequent” heuristic captured by the translation order in the bilingual dictionary.

Our simple approach produces moderate-sized lexicons (3,808, 3,980, 3,027 for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese) compared to Mihalcea et al (2007)'s complicated translation approach (4,983 Romanian words). $$$$$ The final subjectivity lexicon in Romanian contains 4,983 entries.
Our simple approach produces moderate-sized lexicons (3,808, 3,980, 3,027 for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese) compared to Mihalcea et al (2007)'s complicated translation approach (4,983 Romanian words). $$$$$ The hypothesis is that we can eliminate some of the ambiguities (and consequent loss of subjectivity) observed during the lexicon translation by accounting for the context of the ambiguous words, which is possible in a corpus-based approach.

In (Mihalcea et al, 2007), different shortcomings of lexicon-based translation scheme was discussed for the more semantic-oriented task subjective analysis, instead the authors proposed to use a parallel-corpus, apply the classifier in the source language and use the corresponding sentences in the target language to train a new classifier. $$$$$ Given the success of such techniques, the first approach we take to generating a target-language subjectivity classifier is to create a subjectivity lexicon by translating an existing source language lexicon, and then build a classifier that relies on the resulting lexicon.

MT-based projection has been applied to various NLP tasks, such as part of-speech tagging (e.g., Das and Petrov (2011)), mention detection (e.g., Zitouni and Florian (2008)), and sentiment analysis (e.g., Mihalcea et al (2007)). $$$$$ Automatic subjectivity analysis methods have been used in a wide variety of text processing applications, such as tracking sentiment timelines in online forums and news (Lloyd et al., 2005; Balog et al., 2006), review classification (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).
