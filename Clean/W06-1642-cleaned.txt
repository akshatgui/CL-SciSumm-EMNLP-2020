Various attempts have been made to incorporate discourse relations into sentiment analysis $$$$$ Extensive syntactic patterns enable us to detect sentiment expressions and to convert them into semantic structures with high precision, as reported by Kanayama et al. (2004).
Various attempts have been made to incorporate discourse relations into sentiment analysis $$$$$ This section describes the last two processes, which are based on a deep sentiment analysis method analogous to machine translation (Kanayama et al., 2004) (hereafter “the MT method”).

Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) posited that polar clauses with the same polarity tend to appear successively in contexts. $$$$$ As a clue to obtain candidate atoms, we use the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts.
Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) posited that polar clauses with the same polarity tend to appear successively in contexts. $$$$$ For lexical learning from unannotated corpora, our method uses context coherency in terms of polarity, an assumption that polar clauses with the same polarity appear successively unless the context is changed with adversative expressions.

As mentioned in Section 2, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) validated that polar text units with the same polarity tend to appear together to make contexts coherent. $$$$$ We also observed the coherent density of the domain d with the lexicon L defined as

Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) bootstrap subjectivity lexicons for Japanese by generating subjectivity candidates based on word co-occurrence patterns. $$$$$ Building domain-dependent lexicons for many domains is much harder work than preparing domainindependent lexicons and syntactic patterns, because the possible lexical entries are too numerous, and they may differ in each domain.
Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) bootstrap subjectivity lexicons for Japanese by generating subjectivity candidates based on word co-occurrence patterns. $$$$$ These lexicons had 0.8, 0.5, 0.2 times the polar atoms, respectively, compared to L. Table 9 shows the precisions and recalls using these lexicons for the learning process.

In (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), the authors propose an algorithm to automatically expand an initial opinion lexicon based on context coherency, the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts. $$$$$ As a clue to obtain candidate atoms, we use the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts.
In (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), the authors propose an algorithm to automatically expand an initial opinion lexicon based on context coherency, the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts. $$$$$ Our algorithm is fully automatic in the sense that the criteria for the adoption of polar atoms are set automatically by statistical estimation based on the distributions of coherency

Similarly, Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006) used WordNet to expand seed lists with fuzzy sentiment categories, in which words could be more central to one category than the other. Finally, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) used syntactic features and context coherency, defined as the tendency for same polarities to appear successively, to acquire polar atoms. $$$$$ As a clue to obtain candidate atoms, we use the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts.

The second type of relations are word-to-expression relations $$$$$ A polar atom is a minimum syntactic structure specifying polarity in a predicative expression.
The second type of relations are word-to-expression relations $$$$$ The polarities are assumed to be the same in the inter-sentential context, unless there is an adversative expression as those listed in Table 2.

For example, Hatzivassiloglou (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and Kanayama (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) used conjunction rules to solve this problem from large domain corpora. $$$$$ For example, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) labeled adjectives as positive or negative, relying on semantic orientation.

(Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) reported that it was appropriate in 72.2% of cases. $$$$$ Extensive syntactic patterns enable us to detect sentiment expressions and to convert them into semantic structures with high precision, as reported by Kanayama et al. (2004).
(Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) reported that it was appropriate in 72.2% of cases. $$$$$ Besides the conflicting cases, there are many more cases where a polar clause does not appear in the polar context.

Kanayama and Nasukawa used both intra and inter-sentential co-occurrence to learn polarity of words and phrases (Kanayama and Nasukawa,2006). $$$$$ Two polar clauses in the intrasentential and/or inter-sentential context described in Section 4.1.
Kanayama and Nasukawa used both intra and inter-sentential co-occurrence to learn polarity of words and phrases (Kanayama and Nasukawa,2006). $$$$$ The cp values for inter-sentential and intra-sentential contexts are almost the same, and thus both contexts can be used to obtain 2.5 times more clues for the intra-sentential context.

Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) use syntactic features and context coherency, the tendency for same polarities to appear successively, to acquire polar atoms. Other related work is concerned with subjectivity analysis. $$$$$ As a clue to obtain candidate atoms, we use the tendency for same polarities to appear successively in contexts.

Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) improved this work by using the idea of coherency. $$$$$ Our approach and their work can complement each other.
Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) improved this work by using the idea of coherency. $$$$$ The next section describes the method of our unsupervised learning using this imperfect context coherency.

In addition to individual seed words, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) used more complicated syntactic patterns that were manually created. $$$$$ Extensive syntactic patterns enable us to detect sentiment expressions and to convert them into semantic structures with high precision, as reported by Kanayama et al. (2004).
In addition to individual seed words, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) used more complicated syntactic patterns that were manually created. $$$$$ In order to achieve higher recall while maintaining high precision, we apply two types of syntactic patterns, modality patterns and conjunctive patterns4, to the tree structures from the full-parsing.

 $$$$$ However, this limitation reduces the recall of sentiment analysis to a very low level.
 $$$$$ These features allow them to do on-demand analysis of more narrow domains, such as the domain of digital &quot;Perhaps because cameras tend to consume battery power and some users don’t need them. cameras of a specific manufacturer, or the domain of mobile phones from the female users’ point of view.

Next, the target-specific polarity of adjectives is determined using Hearst-like patterns. Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) introduce polar atoms $$$$$ The lexical entries to be acare called the minimum human-understandable syntactic structures that specify the polarity of clauses.
Next, the target-specific polarity of adjectives is determined using Hearst-like patterns. Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) introduce polar atoms $$$$$ Wilson et al. (2005) proposed supervised learning, dividing the resources into prior polarity and context polarity, which are similar to polar atoms and syntactic patterns in this paper, respectively.

More advanced methods such as (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) adopt domain knowledge by extracting sentiment words from the domain-specific corpus. $$$$$ We also observed the coherent precision for each domain corpus.
