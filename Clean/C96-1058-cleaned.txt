In that work, as here, inference is simply the Eisner first-order parsing model (Eisner, 1996) shown in Figure 2.

In that work, as here, inference is simply the Eisner first-order parsing model (Eisner, 1996) shown in Figure 2. In order to score higher-order features, each chart item maintains a list of signatures, which represent subtrees consistent with the chart item. $$$$$ When spans a and b are combined and one more link is added, it is easy to compute the resulting spans score: score(a), score(b)./?r(covering l ink)) When a span constitutes a parse of the whole input sentence, its score as just computed proves to be the parse probability, conditional on the tree root EOS, under model C. The highest-probability parse can therefore be built by dynamic program- ming, where we build and retain the highest- scoring span of each signature.

The child nodes for a given parent are represented in a head-outward fashion such that the left and right children are separate lists, with the left and right-most elements as the last members of their respective lists, as in most generative dependency models (Eisner, 1996). $$$$$ Each time a word i is added, it generates a Markov sequence of (tag,word) pairs to serve, as its left children, and an separate sequence of (tag,word) pairs as its right children.
