Similarly, Snyder and Barzilay (2007) decompose an opinion across several dimensions and capture the sentiment across each dimension. $$$$$ Rather than lumping these aspects into a single score, we would like to capture each aspect of the writer’s opinion separately, thereby providing a more fine-grained view of opinions in the review.

However, it has been observed that ratings for different aspects can be correlated (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), e.g., very negative opinion about room cleanliness is likely to result not only in a low rating for the aspect rooms, but also is very predictive of low ratings for the aspects service and dining. $$$$$ The gain in performance is observed across all five aspects.

Snyder and Barzilay (2007) combine an agreement model based on contrastive RST relations with a local aspect (or target) model to make a more informed overall decision for sentiment classification. $$$$$ We demonstrate that the agreement-based joint model is more expressive than individual ranking models.

Also, it would be interesting to take a closer look at the interactions between aspect and sentiment, especially at a multiple-sentence level (see Snyder and Barzilay 2007). $$$$$ Multiple Aspect Ranking Using the Good Grief Algorithm
Also, it would be interesting to take a closer look at the interactions between aspect and sentiment, especially at a multiple-sentence level (see Snyder and Barzilay 2007). $$$$$ For each possible prediction r = (r[1], ..., r[m]) this criterion assesses the level of grief associated with the ith-aspect ranking model, gi(x, r[i]).

In a multi-aspect setting, however, information about the sentence topic is required to determine the aspect to which a sentiment-bearing word relates (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007). $$$$$ We assume that the griefs of the ranking models are comparable since they are jointly trained. as well as the (previously trained) agreement model to determine the predicted rank for each aspect.

Our first task is a multi-aspect sentiment analysis task, where a system predicts the aspect-specific sentiment ratings (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007). $$$$$ We formulate this task as a multiple aspect ranking problem, where the goal is to produce a set of numerical scores, one for each aspect.

In multi-aspect rating (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007) one finds several distinct aspects such as food or service in a restaurant and then rates them on a fixed linear scale such as 1-5 stars, where all aspects could obtain just 1 star or all aspects could obtain 5 stars independently. $$$$$ For instance, in a restaurant review such opinions may include food, ambience and service.

We also propose to consider aspects of reviews (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), and investigate other methods that measure class similarity, such as selecting typical in stances (Zhang, 1992). $$$$$ Consider any model (w, b = (b)).
