Banea et al (2008) demonstrate that machine translation can perform quite well when extending the subjectivity analysis to multilingual environment, which makes it inspiring to replicate their work on lexicon-based sentiment analysis. $$$$$ Much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data, though work on other languages is growing: e.g., Japanese data are used in (Kobayashi et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2006; Takamura et al., 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al., 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006).

Similar to the approach proposed in (Banea et al, 2008), Wan's method also uses machine translation to produced a labeled Chinese review corpus from the available labeled English review data. $$$$$ We compare our results with those obtained by a previously proposed method that was based on the manual translation of the SemCor subjectivityannotated corpus.

A primary question is whether such lexicons improve performance over a translate-to-English strategy (Banea et al, 2008). $$$$$ A large number of text processing applications have already employed techniques for automatic subjectivity analysis, including automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), tracking sentiment timelines in on-line forums and news (Lloyd et al., 2005; Balog et al., 2006), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).

Similarly, (Banea et al, 2008) propose a method based on machine translation to generate parallel texts, followed by a cross-lingual projection of subjectivity labels, which are used to train subjectivity annotation tools for Romanian and Spanish. $$$$$ This motivates the direction of our research, in which we use machine translation coupled with cross-lingual annotation projections to generate the resources and tools required to perform subjectivity classification in the target language.

Banea et al (2008) proposed several approaches for cross lingual subjectivity analysis by directly applying the translations of opinion corpus in source language to train the opinion classifier on target language. $$$$$ First, we tried to isolate the role played by the quality of the subjectivity annotations in the source-language for the cross-lingual projections of subjectivity.

Various experiments of the first strategy are performed in (Banea et al,2008) for the subjective analysis task and an average 65 F1 score was reported. $$$$$ Among our experiments, experiments two and three are closest to those proposed in (Mihalcea et al., 2007).

As stressed in some work (Banea et al., 2008), researchers have shown that in sentiment analysis, an approach in two steps is often beneficial, in which we first distinguish objective from subjective texts, and then classify subjective texts depending on their polarity (Kim and Hovy, 2006). $$$$$ Much of the work in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English data, though work on other languages is growing: e.g., Japanese data are used in (Kobayashi et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2006; Takamura et al., 2006; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006), Chinese data are used in (Hu et al., 2005), and German data are used in (Kim and Hovy, 2006).

The above two methods have been used in (Banea et al, 2008) for Romanian subjectivity analysis, but the experimental results are not very promising. $$$$$ To evaluate our methods, we generate a Romanian training corpus annotated for subjectivity on which we train a subjectivity classifier, which is then used to label the test data.

Although subjectivity tends to be preserved across languages - see the manual study in (Mihalcea et al, 2007), (Banea et al, 2008) hypothesize that subjectivity is expressed differently in various languages due to lexicalization, formal versus informal markers, etc. $$$$$ This is the same evaluation dataset as used in (Mihalcea et al., 2007).
