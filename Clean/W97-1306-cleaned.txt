This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997). $$$$$ This contrasts strongly with the resolve-all-pronouns results of 78%.
This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997). $$$$$ Despite their poor performance, CogNIAC still remained comparable to the Naive Algorithm.

For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%). $$$$$ For a given rule, if an antecedent is found, then the appropriate annotations are made to the text and no more rules are tried for that pronoun, otherwise the next rule is tried.

The approach for applying the rules is similar to the one proposed by Baldwin (1997). $$$$$ What distinguishes CogNIAC from algorithms that use similar sorts of information is that it will not resolve a pronoun in circumstances of ambiguity.

The CogNIAC algorithm (Baldwin, 1997) was designed for high-precision AR. $$$$$ Note the high precision of rules 1 - 6).
The CogNIAC algorithm (Baldwin, 1997) was designed for high-precision AR. $$$$$ The high precision rules of CogNIAC performed very well, greater than 90% precision with good recall for the first experiment.

RAP (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996), Baldwin's pronoun resolution method (Baldwin, 1997) and Mitkov's knowledge-poor pronoun resolution approach (Mitkov, 1998b). $$$$$ Pronoun resolution is one of the 'classic' computational linguistics problems.
RAP (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996), Baldwin's pronoun resolution method (Baldwin, 1997) and Mitkov's knowledge-poor pronoun resolution approach (Mitkov, 1998b). $$$$$ Pronoun resolution systems have extremely limited knowledge sources, they cannot access a fraction of human common sense knowledge.

Since the original version of CogNiac is non-robust and resolves only anaphors that obey certain rules, for fairer and comparable results we implemented the resolve-all version as described in (Baldwin, 1997). $$$$$ In comparison, none of the six rules of CogNIAC would resolve the pronoun.
Since the original version of CogNiac is non-robust and resolves only anaphors that obey certain rules, for fairer and comparable results we implemented the resolve-all version as described in (Baldwin, 1997). $$$$$ In the first experiment, the high precision version of CogNIAC correctly resolved 62% of the pronouns as compared to the resolve all pronouns version which resolved 79% of them--a 27% loss of overall recall.

Baldwin's CogNiac (Baldwin, 1997) is a knowledge poor approach to anaphora resolution based on a set of high confidence rules which are successively applied over the pronoun under consideration. $$$$$ The system does this by being very sensitive to ambiguity, and only resolving pronouns when very high confidence rules have been satisfied.

This definition is slightly different from the one used in (Baldwin, 1997) and (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 2000). $$$$$ CogNIAC has been evaluated in two different contexts.

As expected, the results reported in Table 1 do not match the original results published by Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), Baldwin (1997) and Mitkov (1998b) where the algorithms were tested on different data, employed different pre-processing tools, resorted to different degrees of manual intervention and thus provided no common ground for any reliable comparison. $$$$$ CogNIAC has been evaluated in two different contexts.

Evaluation results for both evaluation modes are 76 given in traditional precision, recall and f-score, which are similar to (Baldwin, 1997). $$$$$ 3.2.2 Experiment 2-- All pronouns in MUC-6 evaluation

Pronoun resolution is carried out using the Glencova Pronoun Resolution algorithm (Halpin et al, 2004), based on a series of rules similar to the CogNIAC engine (Baldwin, 1997), but without gender information based rules since this is not provided by the Penn Treebank tag set. $$$$$ In comparison, none of the six rules of CogNIAC would resolve the pronoun.

As a consequence, current anaphor resolution implementations mainly rely on constraints and preference heuristics which employ information originated from morphosyntactic or shallow semantic analysis ,e.g. in Baldwin (1997). $$$$$ The kinds of information CogNIAC does require includes
