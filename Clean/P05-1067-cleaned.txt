As mentioned in (Ding and Palmer, 2005), most of these approaches require some assumptions on the level of isomorphism (lexical and/or structural) between two languages. $$$$$ A synchronous derivation process for the two syntactic structures of both languages suggests the level of cross-lingual isomorphism between the two trees (e.g.
As mentioned in (Ding and Palmer, 2005), most of these approaches require some assumptions on the level of isomorphism (lexical and/or structural) between two languages. $$$$$ The synchronous version, SDIG, assumes that the isomorphism of the two syntactic structures is at the ET level, rather than at the word level, hence allowing non-isomorphic tree to tree mapping.
