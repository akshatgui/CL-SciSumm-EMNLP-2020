Echihabi and Marcu (2003) have developed a noisy-channel model for QA, which explains how a sentence containing an answer to a given question can be rewritten into that question through a sequence of stochastic operations. $$$$$ This model explains how a given sentence SA that contains an answer sub-string A to a question Q can be rewritten into Q through a sequence of stochastic operations.

At a high level, the QA task boils down to only two essential steps (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003). $$$$$ In Section 2, we first present the noisy-channel model that we propose for this task.

In contrast, Echihabi and Marcu (2003) introduce an SMT-based method for extracting the concrete answer in factoid QA. $$$$$ We introduce a probabilistic noisychannel model for question answering and we show how it can be exploited in the context of an end-to-end QA system.
In contrast, Echihabi and Marcu (2003) introduce an SMT-based method for extracting the concrete answer in factoid QA. $$$$$ We use the same method to automatically enhance this set by retrieving from the web sentences containing answers to the questions.

The approach of Echihabi and Marcu (2003) that uses translation probabilities to rank the answers achieves higher results on the same data set (an MRR of 0.325 versus our 0.141). $$$$$ We call this data set TREC9-10Web.

In (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) another form of combining strategies for advanced QA is proposed $$$$$ The noisy channel framework we proposed in this paper can approximate the reasoning mechanism employed by LCC and accommodate the exploitation of gloss- and synonymy-based relations found in WordNet.
In (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) another form of combining strategies for advanced QA is proposed $$$$$ Lin (2002) showed through his federated approach that 47% of TREC-2001 questions could be answered using Web-based knowledge sources.

We propose to study and develop several kernel methods that can operate in Support Vector Machines for determining the optimal strategies and compare the results with the Maximum Entropy combinations reported in (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003). $$$$$ And systems such as those developed by IBM and BBN map questions and answers into feature sets and compute the similarity between them using maximum entropy models that are trained on question-answer corpora.

As any QA system can virtually be decomposed into two major high-level components, retrieval and selection (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003), the answer selection problem is clearly critical. $$$$$ In this paper, we propose a new approach to QA in which the contribution of various resources and components can be easily assessed.

Echihabi and Marcu (2003) align all paths in questions with trees for heuristically pruned answers. $$$$$ From this perspective then, the fundamental problem of question answering is that of finding spaces where the distance between questions and sentences that contain correct answers is small and where the distance between questions and sentences that contain incorrect answers is large.
