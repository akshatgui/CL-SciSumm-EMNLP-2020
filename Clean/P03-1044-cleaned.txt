This problem is being addressed through automatic knowledge acquisition methods, such as unsupervised learning for domain-specific lexicons (Lin et al, 2003) and extraction patterns (Yangarber, 2003), which require the user to provide only a small set of lexical items of the target classes or extraction patterns for the target domain. $$$$$ The user provides a small number of seed patterns for .

We begin by outlining the general process of learning extraction patterns using a semi-supervised algorithm, similar to one presented by Yangarber (2003). $$$$$ This happens because at some point in the learning process the algorithm picks up patterns that are common in , but are not sufficiently specific to alone.
