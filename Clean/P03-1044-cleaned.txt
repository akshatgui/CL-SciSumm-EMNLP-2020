This problem is being addressed through automatic knowledge acquisition methods, such as unsupervised learning for domain-specific lexicons (Lin et al, 2003) and extraction patterns (Yangarber, 2003), which require the user to provide only a small set of lexical items of the target classes or extraction patterns for the target domain. $$$$$ The user provides a small number of seed patterns for .
