In (Brill, 1995) a system of rules which uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules is described. $$$$$ The direct correlation between rules and performance improvement in transformation-based learning can make the learned rules more readily interpretable than decision tree rules for increasing population purity.'
In (Brill, 1995) a system of rules which uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules is described. $$$$$ If the most likely tag for unknown words can be assigned with high accuracy, then the contextual rules can be used to improve accuracy, as described above.

Brill (Brill, 1995) outlines a transformation-based learner which learns guessing rules from a pre-tagged training corpus. $$$$$ This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994).

The task is typically addressed as a sequential tagging problem; one notable exception is the work of Brill (1995), who proposed non-sequential transformation-based learning. $$$$$ In this section we describe the practical application of transformation-based learning to part-of-speech tagging.'

For example, Dojchinova and Mihov (2004) mapped their initial tag set of 946 tags to just 40, which allowed them to achieve 95.5% accuracy using the transformation-based learning of Brill (1995), and 98.4% accuracy using manually crafted linguistic rules. $$$$$ Using the tagger without lexicalized rules, an overall accuracy of 96.3% and an unknown word accuracy of 82.0% is obtained.

We used Brill's tagger (Brill, 1995) and Memory-Based Shallow Parser (Daelemansetal., 1999) to analyze English sentences. $$$$$ This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994).

A third, clean-up pass is then performed to partially disambiguate the identified WordNet glosses with Brill's part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995), which performs with up to 95% accuracy, and eliminates errors introduced into the list by part-of-speech ambiguity of some words acquired in pass 1 and from the seed list. $$$$$ This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994).

According to (Brill, 1995), a Transformation-Based Error-Driven learning application is defined by 1. The initial annotation scheme 2. The space of allowable transformations 3. The iterative algorithm for choosing a transformation sequence. $$$$$ Figure 1 illustrates how transformation-based error-driven learning works.

For example, in a part-of-speech tagging task, the initial an notation may assign each token its most likely tag without any regard to context (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ Consider the part-of-speech tagging example above.

The addition of a look-ahead searcher has been suggested (Brill, 1995), but we have not seen it implemented in a research context, likely due to the fact that a straightforward implementation of the concept would at minimum square the amount of time required for training. $$$$$ Other more sophisticated search techniques could be used, such as simulated annealing or learning with a look-ahead window, but we have not yet explored these alternatives.

Many alternatives suggest themselves to expand the options, including maximum entropy models, which have been previously successfully applied to, inter alia, sentence boundary detection (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), and transformation-based learning, as used in part-of-speech tagging and statistical parsing applications (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994).

TBL is a machine learning approach that has been employed to solve a number of problems in natural language processing; most famously, it has been used for part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ Transformation-Based-Error-Driven Learning And Natural Language Processing

The most notable of these include the trigram HMM tagger (Brants, 2000), maximum entropy tagger (Ratna park hi, 1996), transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1995), and cyclic dependency networks (Toutanova et al, 2003). $$$$$ Accuracy of that tagger was 97.0%.

There has been a modest amount of previous work on improving probabilistic decision lists, as well as a fair amount of work in related fields, especially in transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995). $$$$$ There are a number of practical differences between transformation-based error-driven learning and learning decision trees.

For instance, in part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995), when the tag of one word is changed, it changes the answers to questions for nearby words. $$$$$ For instance, whether the previous word is tagged as to-infinitival or to-preposition may be a good cue for determining the part of speech of a word.'

In line with our assumption of raw text to extract over, we use the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) to automatically tag the WSJ, rather than making use of the manual POS annotation provided in the Penn Treebank. $$$$$ In the nonlexicalized tagger, the transformation templates we use are
