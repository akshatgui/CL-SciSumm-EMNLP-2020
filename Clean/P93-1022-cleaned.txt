Dagan et al (1993) argue that using a relatively small number of classes to model the similarity between words may lead to substantial loss of information. $$$$$ Statistical data about these various cooccurrence relations is employed for a variety of applications, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), language generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), machine translation (Brown et al., ; Sadler, 1989), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989) and various disambiguation tasks (Dagan et al., 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Grishman et al., 1986; Dagan and Itai, 1990).
Dagan et al (1993) argue that using a relatively small number of classes to model the similarity between words may lead to substantial loss of information. $$$$$ Class based models (Brown et al., ; Pereira et al., 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992) distinguish between unobserved cooccurrences using classes of &quot;similar&quot; words.

As to the research on computing word sense relatedness, Dagan et al (1993) did some pilot work and Lee (1997) and Resnik (1999) contributed to the research on semantic similarity. $$$$$ Class based models (Brown et al., ; Pereira et al., 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992) distinguish between unobserved cooccurrences using classes of &quot;similar&quot; words.
As to the research on computing word sense relatedness, Dagan et al (1993) did some pilot work and Lee (1997) and Resnik (1999) contributed to the research on semantic similarity. $$$$$ To carry out the evaluation, we implemented a variant of the disambiguation method of (Dagan et al., 1991), for sense disambiguation in machine translation.

In (Dagan et al., 1993) and (Pereira et al, 1993), clusters of similar words are evaluated by how well they are able to recover data items that are removed from the input corpus one at a time. $$$$$ Class based models (Brown et al., ; Pereira et al., 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992) distinguish between unobserved cooccurrences using classes of &quot;similar&quot; words.
In (Dagan et al., 1993) and (Pereira et al, 1993), clusters of similar words are evaluated by how well they are able to recover data items that are removed from the input corpus one at a time. $$$$$ In the second evaluation, the estimation method had to distinguish between members of two sets of 61t should be emphasized that the TWS method uses only a monolingual target corpus, and not a bilingual corpus as in other methods ((Brown et al., 1991; Gale et al., 1992)).
