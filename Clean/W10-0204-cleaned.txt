Since we were additionally interested in determining colour signatures for emotions (Section 7), we chose to annotate all of the 10,170 word-sense pairs that Mohammad and Turney (2010) used to create their word emotion lexicon. $$$$$ On the one hand, we do not want to choose a fine-grained sense-inventory because then the number of word–sense combinations will become too large and difficult to easily distinguish, and on the other hand we do not want to work only at the word level because when used in different senses a word may evoke different emotions.
Since we were additionally interested in determining colour signatures for emotions (Section 7), we chose to annotate all of the 10,170 word-sense pairs that Mohammad and Turney (2010) used to create their word emotion lexicon. $$$$$ If a word has more than one sense, then it can be found in more than one thesaurus category.

For example, Mohammad and Turney (2010) study the affects words can evoke in people's minds, while Bollen et al (2011) study various moods ,e.g., tension, depression, beyond simple dichotomy of positive and negative sentiment. $$$$$ This work is intended to be a pilot study before we create a much larger emotion lexicon with tens of thousands of terms.
For example, Mohammad and Turney (2010) study the affects words can evoke in people's minds, while Bollen et al (2011) study various moods ,e.g., tension, depression, beyond simple dichotomy of positive and negative sentiment. $$$$$ Natural symmetry apart, we believe that prior work on automatically computing word–pair antonymy (Lin et al., 2003; Mohammad et al., 2008; Lobanova et al., 2010) can now be leveraged in automatic emotion detection.

 $$$$$ We want the users to annotate a word only if they are already familiar with it and know its meanings.
 $$$$$ And last but not least, thanks to the more than 1000 anonymous people who answered the emotion survey with diligence and care.

In this work, we make this transition more explicit and intentional, by introducing a novel connotation lexicon. Mohammad and Turney (2010) focussed on emotion evoked by common words and phrases. $$$$$ Emotions Evoked by Common Words and Phrases

Two main differences are $$$$$ Emotions Evoked by Common Words and Phrases

For instance, our co-occurrence method is an adaption of a technique applied in sentiment analysis (Turney and Littman, 2003), which has recently been shown to work for formality (Brooke et al, 2010), a dimension of stylistic variation that seems closely related to readability. Taboada et al (2011) validate their sentiment lexicon using crowd sourced judgments of the relative polarity of pairs of words, and in fact crowd sourcing has been applied directly to the creation of emotion lexicons (Mohammad and Turney, 2010). $$$$$ Natural symmetry apart, we believe that prior work on automatically computing word–pair antonymy (Lin et al., 2003; Mohammad et al., 2008; Lobanova et al., 2010) can now be leveraged in automatic emotion detection.

(2009).

Mohammad and Turney (2010) created a crowd sourced term emotion association lexicon consisting of associations of over 10,000 word-sense pairs with eight emotions joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust, surprise, and anticipation argued to be the basic and prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980). $$$$$ We focus on the emotions of joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust, surprise, and anticipation— argued by many to be the basic and prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980).

The Mohammad and Turney (2010) lexicon also has associations with positive and negative polarity. $$$$$ The surprise terms are more than twice as likely to be positive than negative.

According to Mohammad and Turney (2010), adverbs and adjectives are some of the most emotion-inspiring terms. $$$$$ Are emotions more commonly evoked by nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs?
According to Mohammad and Turney (2010), adverbs and adjectives are some of the most emotion-inspiring terms. $$$$$ Adverbs and adjectives are some of the most emotion inspiring terms and this is not surprising considering that they are used to qualify a noun or a verb.

Mohammad and Turney (2010) compiled emotion an notations for about 4000 words with eight emotions (six of Ekman, trust, and anticipation). $$$$$ Similarly, fear and sadness go together, as do joy, trust, and anticipation.
Mohammad and Turney (2010) compiled emotion an notations for about 4000 words with eight emotions (six of Ekman, trust, and anticipation). $$$$$ On the other hand, positive words evoke anticipation, joy, and trust.

The questions are phrased exactly as described in Mohammad and Turney (2010). $$$$$ In order to overcome the challenges described above, before asking the annotators questions about what emotions are evoked by a target term, we first present them with a word choice problem pertaining to the target.

The questions were phrased exactly as described in Mohammad and Turney (2010). If an annotator answers Q1 incorrectly, then in formation obtained from the remaining questions is discarded. $$$$$ If an annotator is not familiar with the target word and still attempts to answer questions pertaining to the target, or is randomly clicking options in our questionnaire, then there is a 75% chance that they will get the answer to this question wrong, and we can discard all responses pertaining to this target term by the annotator (that is, we discard answers to the emotion questions provided by the annotator for this target term).
The questions were phrased exactly as described in Mohammad and Turney (2010). If an annotator answers Q1 incorrectly, then in formation obtained from the remaining questions is discarded. $$$$$ If an annotator obtained an overall score that is less than 66.67% on the word choice questions (that is, got more than one out of three wrong), then we assumed that, contrary to instructions, HITs for words not familiar to the annotator were attempted.

Emotional connotation works exactly in the same way, but in this case word-emotion associations are taken from (Mohammad and Turney, 2010). $$$$$ EmoLexGI are all the words taken from the General Inquirer.
