One is the case in which a pronoun x correctly says that it is coreferent with another pronoun y. However, the program misidentifies the antecedent of y. In this case (sometimes called error chaining (Walker, 1989)), both x and y are to be scored as wrong, as they both end up in the wrong coreferential chain. $$$$$ However one can and should measure the effects of error chaining, since reporting numbers that correct for error chaining is misleading, but if the error that produced the error chain can be corrected then the algorithm might show a significant improvement.

I use the following guidelines for the hand-simulated analysis (Walker, 1989). $$$$$ Thus there are two parts to this paper

Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal oun phrases matches its syntactic features. $$$$$ However, when looking for a pronoun's antecedent within a sentence, it will go sequentially further and further up the tree to the left of the pronoun, and that failing will look in the previous sentence.
Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal oun phrases matches its syntactic features. $$$$$ The main difference is that the choice of a co-specifier for a pronoun in the Hobbs algorithm depends in part on the position of that pronoun in the sentence.

 $$$$$ Hobbs discusses at length other assumptions that he makes about the capabilities of an interpretive process that operates before the algorithm [Hob761)].
