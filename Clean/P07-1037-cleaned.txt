This is a simple way of including syntactic information in a phrase-based model, and has also been suggested by Hassan et al (2007). $$$$$ This way we directly extend the baseline model described in section 3 with supertags both in the phrase translation table and in the language model.

Supertagging (Hassan et al, 2007b) $$$$$ In this work we show that incorporating lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of supertags can yield significantly better PBSMT systems.
Supertagging (Hassan et al, 2007b) $$$$$ We describe a novel PBSMT model that integrates supertags into the target language model and the target side of the translation model.

We have previously shown this approach to be very effective for both case and punctuation restoration (Hassan et al, 2007a). $$$$$ Only quite recently have (Chiang, 2005) and (Marcu et al., 2006) shown that incorporating some form of syntactic structure could show improvements over a baseline PBSMT system.

Birch et al (2007) and Hassan et al (2007) have shown the effectiveness of adding supertags on the target side, and Avramidis and Koehn (2008) have focused on the source side, translating a morphologically-poor language (English) to a morphologically-rich language (Greek). $$$$$ For example, our supertag-enriched target phrases need not be (Koehn et al., 2003) demonstrated that adding syn- generalized into (xRS or any other) rules that work tax actually harmed the quality of their SMT system. with abstract categories.

Hassan et al (2007) improve the statistical phrase based MT model by injecting supertags, lexical information such as the POS tag of the word and its subcategorization information, into the phrase table, resulting in generalized phrases with placeholders in them. $$$$$ The lexical entries consist of syntactic constructs (‘supertags’) that describe information such as the POS tag of the word, its subcategorization information and the hierarchy of phrase categories that the word projects upwards.

This analysis then lets us abstract and encode many local and some nonlocal syntactic structures as complex tags (dynamically, as opposed to the static complex tags as proposed by Birch et al (2007) and Hassan et al (2007)). $$$$$ POS Tags vs. Supertags A supertag is a complex tag that localizes the dependency and the syntax information from the context, whereas a normal POS tag just describes the general syntactic category of the word without further constraints.
