Supertagging (Hassan et al, 2007b): incorporating lexical syntactic descriptions, in the form of supertags, to the language model and target side of the translation model in order to better inform decoding. $$$$$ In this work we show that incorporating lexical syntactic descriptions in the form of supertags can yield significantly better PBSMT systems.

This analysis then lets us abstract and encode many local and some nonlocal syntactic structures as complex tags (dynamically, as opposed to the static complex tags as proposed by Birch et al (2007) and Hassan et al (2007)). $$$$$ POS Tags vs. Supertags A supertag is a complex tag that localizes the dependency and the syntax information from the context, whereas a normal POS tag just describes the general syntactic category of the word without further constraints.
