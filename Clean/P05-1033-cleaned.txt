Similarly, Chiang (2005) uses the k-best parsing algorithm described below in a CFG-based log-linear translation model in order to learn feature weights which maximize BLEU. $$$$$ This can result in nbest lists with very few different translations or feature vectors, which is problematic for the algorithm we use to tune the feature weights.

We also implemented Algorithms 2 and 3 in a parsing-based MT decoder (Chiang, 2005) and report results on decoding speed. $$$$$ This is faster than our Python implementation of a standard phrase-based decoder, so we expect that a future optimized implementation of the hierarchical decoder will run at a speed competitive with other phrase-based systems.

Following this WSD reformulation for SMT, Chan et al (2007) integrate a state-of-the-art WSD system into a hierarchical phrase-based system (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ We compared a baseline system, the state-of-the-art phrase-based system Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003; Koehn, 2004a), against our system.
Following this WSD reformulation for SMT, Chan et al (2007) integrate a state-of-the-art WSD system into a hierarchical phrase-based system (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ Hierarchical phrase pairs, which can be learned without any syntactically-annotated training data, improve translation accuracy significantly compared with a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.

Whenever we combine two dynamic programming items, we need to score the fluency of their concatentation by incorporating the score of any language model features which cross the target side boundaries of the two concatenated items (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ Each cell contains all the items standing for X spanning fi/.
Whenever we combine two dynamic programming items, we need to score the fluency of their concatentation by incorporating the score of any language model features which cross the target side boundaries of the two concatenated items (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ This suggests that the model will prefer serial combination of phrases, unless some other factor supports the use of hierarchical phrases (e.g., a better language model score).

For instance, Zollmann et al (2006) follow Chiang (2005) in disallowing adjacent non terminals. $$$$$ The basic phrase-based model is an instance of the noisy-channel approach (Brown et al., 1993),1 in which the translation of a French sentence f into an from position i to position j inclusive, and similarly for eji .
For instance, Zollmann et al (2006) follow Chiang (2005) in disallowing adjacent non terminals. $$$$$ Above the phrase level, these models typically have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003), or not at all (Zens and Ney, 2004; Kumar et al., 2005).

(Cherry, 2008) and (Marton and Resnik, 2008) introduce syntactic constraints into the standard phrase-based decoding (Koehn et al, 2003) and hierarchical phrase-based decoding (Chiang, 2005) respectively by using a counting feature which accumulates whenever hypotheses violate syntactic boundaries of source-side parse trees. $$$$$ We compared a baseline system, the state-of-the-art phrase-based system Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003; Koehn, 2004a), against our system.

More previously, (Chiang, 2005) rewards hypotheses whenever they exactly match constituent boundaries of parse trees on the source side. $$$$$ It translates the above example almost exactly as we have shown, the only error being that it omits the word ‘that’ from (6) and therefore (8).

To better leverage syntactic constraint yet still allow non-syntactic translations, Chiang (2005) introduces a count for each hypothesis and accumulates it whenever the hypothesis exactly matches syntactic boundaries on the source side. $$$$$ Koehn et al.

To better leverage syntactic constraint yet still allow non-syntactic translations, Chiang (2005) introduces a count for each hypothesis and accumulates it whenever the hypothesis exactly matches syntactic boundaries on the source side. $$$$$ Thus, favoring subtrees in our model that are syntactic phrases might provide a fairer way of testing the hypothesis that syntactic phrases are better phrases.

Chiang (2005)'s hierarchal phrase-based model achieves significant performance improvement. $$$$$ Thus it can be seen as shift to the of syntaxtranslation systems without any lin- In our experiments using BLEU as a metric, the hierarchical phrasebased model achieves a relative improvement of 7.5% over Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.
Chiang (2005)'s hierarchal phrase-based model achieves significant performance improvement. $$$$$ We then tested our system, using the settings described above.4 Our system achieves an absolute improvement of 0.02 over the baseline (7.5% relative), without using any additional training data.

However, no further significant improvement is achieved when the model is made sensitive to syntactic structures by adding a constituent feature (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ The use of hierarchical structures opens the possibility of making the model sensitive to syntactic structure.
However, no further significant improvement is achieved when the model is made sensitive to syntactic structures by adding a constituent feature (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ Although the feature improved accuracy on the development set (from 0.314 to 0.322), it gave no statistically significant improvement on the test set.

However, formal SCFG show much better performance in the formally syntax-based translation framework (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ A move to synchronous CFG can be seen as a move towards syntax-based MT; however, we make a distinction here between formally syntax-based and linguistically syntax-based MT.
However, formal SCFG show much better performance in the formally syntax-based translation framework (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ A system like that of Yamada and Knight (2001) is both formally and linguistically syntax-based: formally because it uses synchronous CFG, linguistically because the structures it is defined over are (on the English side) informed by syntactic theory (via the Penn Treebank).

This is because the formal syntax is learned from phrases directly without relying on any linguistic theory (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ A move to synchronous CFG can be seen as a move towards syntax-based MT; however, we make a distinction here between formally syntax-based and linguistically syntax-based MT.
This is because the formal syntax is learned from phrases directly without relying on any linguistic theory (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ Our system is formally syntaxbased in that it uses synchronous CFG, but not necessarily linguistically syntax-based, because it induces a grammar from a parallel text without relying on any linguistic annotations or assumptions; the result sometimes resembles a syntactician’s grammar but often does not.

Standard ngram language models assign probabilities to translation hypotheses in the target language, typically as smoothed trigram models (Chiang, 2005). $$$$$ The word penalty is easy; the language model is integrated by intersecting the English-side CFG with the language model, which is a weighted finitestate automaton.

Recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (Brown et al, 1993) and phrase based (Koehn et al, 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (Chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (Melamed, 2004). $$$$$ A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model For Statistical Machine Translation

While (Chiang, 2005) uses only two nonterminal symbols in his grammar, we introduce multiple syntactic categories, taking advantage of a target language parser for this information. $$$$$ Note that we have used only a single nonterminal symbol X instead of assigning syntactic categories to phrases.
While (Chiang, 2005) uses only two nonterminal symbols in his grammar, we introduce multiple syntactic categories, taking advantage of a target language parser for this information. $$$$$ The parser only operates on the French-side grammar; the English-side grammar affects parsing only by increasing the effective grammar size, because there may be multiple rules with the same French side but different English sides, and also because intersecting the language model with the English-side grammar introduces many states into the nonterminal alphabet, which are projected over to the French side.
