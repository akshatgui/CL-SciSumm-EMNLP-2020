Dagan and Itai (Dagan and Itai, 1990) experimented with co-occurrence statistics that are similar to our lexical case frame expectations. $$$$$ This is shown by a similar database that w~s implemented as part of the laslgllage model of the IBM speech recognition system.

Researchers since Dagan and Itai (1990) have variously argued for and against the utility of collocation statistics between nouns and parents for improving the performance of pronoun resolution. $$$$$ Automatic Processing of Large Corpora fbr the Resolution of Anaphor  References Ido Dagan * Alon Itai Computer Science Department Technion, tIaifa, Israel dagan~techunix .b i tnet ,  i ta i~ cs.technion, ac.il Abstract Manual acquisition of semantic onstraints in broad domains is very expensive.
Researchers since Dagan and Itai (1990) have variously argued for and against the utility of collocation statistics between nouns and parents for improving the performance of pronoun resolution. $$$$$ An experiment was performed to resolve references of the pronoun "it" in sentences that were randomly selected from the corpus.

Dagan an dItai (1990) use the distribution of a pronoun's context to determine which candidate antecedents can fit the context. $$$$$ Therefore, the output is considered correct if the appropriate candidate is approved.
Dagan an dItai (1990) use the distribution of a pronoun's context to determine which candidate antecedents can fit the context. $$$$$ In 18 of these cases, the appropriate candidate was the only one which was approved, getting a complete resolution of the ambiguity.

Dagan and Itai (1990), for example, developed a statistical approach for pronominal anaphora, but the information they used was simply the patterns obtained from the previous analysis of the text. $$$$$ The rest of the paper describes how this method is used to resolve anaphora references.
Dagan and Itai (1990), for example, developed a statistical approach for pronominal anaphora, but the information they used was simply the patterns obtained from the previous analysis of the text. $$$$$ 2 The Statist ical  Approach According to the statistical model, cooccurrence patterns that were observed in tile corpns are used as selection patterns.

Consider the example given in the work of Dagan and Itai (1990): (1) They know full well that companies held tax money aside for collection later on the basis that the government said it was going to collect it2. $$$$$ 1988]: (1) They know full well that the companies held tax money aside for collection later on the b~sis that the government said it was going to collect it.
Consider the example given in the work of Dagan and Itai (1990): (1) They know full well that companies held tax money aside for collection later on the basis that the government said it was going to collect it2. $$$$$ The following table lists the pat- terns that were produced by substituting each can- 330 1 didate with the anaphor, and the number of times each of these patterns occurred in the corpus: subject-verb collection collect 0 subject-verb money collect S subject-verb government collect 198 verb -ob jec t  collect collection 0 verb.-obj ect  collect money 149 verb-~object collect government 0 According to these statistics "government" is pre- ferred as the reti~rent of the first "it", and "money" of the second.

One of the earliest methods for using predicate-argument frequencies in pronoun resolution is that of Dagan and Itai (1990). $$$$$ When using selectional constraints for anaphora resolution, the referent must satisfy the constraints which are imposed on the anaphor.
