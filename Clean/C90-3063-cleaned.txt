Researchers since Dagan and Itai (1990) have variously argued for and against the utility of collocation statistics between nouns and parents for improving the performance of pronoun resolution. $$$$$ An experiment was performed to resolve references of the pronoun "it" in sentences that were randomly selected from the corpus.

Dagan an dItai (1990) use the distribution of a pronoun's context to determine which candidate antecedents can fit the context. $$$$$ Therefore, the output is considered correct if the appropriate candidate is approved.
Dagan an dItai (1990) use the distribution of a pronoun's context to determine which candidate antecedents can fit the context. $$$$$ In 18 of these cases, the appropriate candidate was the only one which was approved, getting a complete resolution of the ambiguity.

Dagan and Itai (1990), for example, developed a statistical approach for pronominal anaphora, but the information they used was simply the patterns obtained from the previous analysis of the text. $$$$$ The rest of the paper describes how this method is used to resolve anaphora references.

One of the earliest methods for using predicate-argument frequencies in pronoun resolution is that of Dagan and Itai (1990). $$$$$ When using selectional constraints for anaphora resolution, the referent must satisfy the constraints which are imposed on the anaphor.
