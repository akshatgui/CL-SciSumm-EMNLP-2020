Moore and Pollack (1992) gave an example of a simple discourse. $$$$$ A simple extension of our previous example illustrates the point

Moore and Pollack (1992) note that Rhetorical Structure Theory conflates the informational (the information being conveyed) and intentional (the effects on the reader's beliefs or attitudes) levels of discourse. $$$$$ Moreover, RST suggests that the information conveyed in a discourse over and above what is conveyed in its component clauses can be derived from the rhetorical relation-based structure of the discourse.
Moore and Pollack (1992) note that Rhetorical Structure Theory conflates the informational (the information being conveyed) and intentional (the effects on the reader's beliefs or attitudes) levels of discourse. $$$$$ We thus conclude that in RST, and, indeed, in any viable theory of discourse structure, analyses at the informational and the intentional levels must coexist.

Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ (1992).
Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trees. $$$$$ This structure is illustrated below

For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONDITION for B3. $$$$$ (1992).

However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classifiers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987), argues that in most coherent discourse, consecutive discourse elements are related by a small set of rhetorical relations.
However, the results are trees of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1986), and the classifiers rely on well-formedness constraints on RST trees which are too restrictive (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ However, recent work by Moore and Paris (1992) noted that RST cannot be used as the sole means of controlling discourse structure in an interactive dialogue system, because RST representations provide insufficient information to support the generation of appropriate responses to &quot;follow-up questions.&quot; The basic problem is that an RST representation of a discourse does not fully specify the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986) of that discourse.

Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both informational (semantic) and intentional relations can hold between clause simultaneously and independently. $$$$$ (1992).
Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both informational (semantic) and intentional relations can hold between clause simultaneously and independently. $$$$$ Indeed, there will be potentially n x m relations created from a theory that initially includes n informational relations and m intentional relations.

Finally, sometimes more than one relation can hold between two given units (Moore and Pollack, 1992). $$$$$ (1992).
