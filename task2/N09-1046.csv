Compound words pose significant challenges to the lexicalized models that are currently common in statistical machine translation.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This problem has been widely acknowledged, and the conventional solution, which has been shown to work well for many language pairs, is to segment compounds into their constituent morphemes using either morphological analyzers or empirical methods and then to translate from or to this segmented variant (Koehn et al., 2008; Dyer et al., 2008; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
But into what units should a compound word be segmented?,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Taken as a stand-alone task, the goal of a compound splitter is to produce a segmentation for some input that matches the linguistic intuitions of a native speaker of the language.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, there are often advantages to using elements larger than single morphemes as the minimal lexical unit for MT, since they may correspond more closely to the units of translation.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Unfortunately, determining the optimal segmentation is challenging, typically requiring extensive experimentation (Koehn and Knight, 2003; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Chang et al., 2008).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Recent work has shown that by combining a variety of segmentations of the input into a segmentation lattice and effectively marginalizing over many different segmentations, translations superior to those resulting from any single single segmentation of the input can be obtained (Xu et al., 2005; Dyer et al., 2008; DeNeefe et al., 2008).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Unfortunately, this approach is difficult to utilize because it requires multiple segmenters that behave differently on the same input.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we describe a maximum entropy word segmentation model that is trained to assign high probability to possibly several segmentations of an input word.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This model enables generation of diverse, accurate segmentation lattices from a single model that are appropriate for use in decoders that accept word lattices as input, such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Since our model relies a small number of dense features, its parameters can be tuned using very small amounts of manually created reference lattices.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Furthermore, since these parameters were chosen to have valid interpretation across a variety of languages, we find that the weights estimated for one apply quite well to another.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We show that these lattices significantly improve translation quality when translating into English from three languages exhibiting productive compounding: German, Turkish, and Hungarian.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The paper is structured as follows.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In the next section, we describe translation from segmentation lattices and give a motivating example, Section 3 describes our segmentation model and its tuning and how it is used to generate segmentation lattices, Section 5 presents experimental results, Section 6 reviews relevant related work, and in Section 7 we conclude and discuss future work.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
In this section we give a brief overview of lattice translation and then describe the characteristics of segmentation lattices that are appropriate for translation.,"{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Word lattices have been used to represent ambiguous input to machine translation systems for a variety of tasks, including translating automatic speech recognition transcriptions and translating from morphologically complex languages (Bertoldi et al., 2007; Dyer et al., 2008).","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
The intuition behind using lattices in both approaches is to avoid the error propagation effects that are found when a one-best guess is used.,"{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"By carrying a certain amount of uncertainty forward in the processing pipeline, information contained in the translation models can be leveraged to help resolve the upstream ambiguity.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"In our case, we want to propagate uncertainty about the proper segmentation of a compound forward to the decoder, which can use its full translation model to select proper segmentation for translation.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Mathematically, this can be understood as follows: whereas the goal in conventional machine translation is to find the sentence ˆeI1 that maximizes Pr(eI1|fJ1 ), the lattice adds a latent variable, the path f¯ from a designated start start to a designated goal state in the lattice G: If the transduction formalism used is a synchronous probabilistic context free grammar or weighted finite Figure 1 shows two lattices that encode the most linguistically plausible ways of segmenting two prototypical German compounds with compositional meanings.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"However, while these words are structurally quite similar, translating them into English would seem to require different amounts of segmentation.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, the dictionary fragment shown in Table 1 illustrates that tonbandaufnahme can be rendered into English by following 3 different paths in the lattice, ton/audio band/tape aufnahme/recording, tonband/tape aufnahme/recording, and tonbandaufnahme/tape recording.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"In contrast, wiederaufnahme can only be translated correctly using the unsegmented form, even though in German the meaning of the full form is a composition of the meaning of the individual morphemes.1 It should be noted that phrase-based models can translate multiple words as a unit, and therefore capture non-compositional meaning.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, by default if the training data is processed such that, for example, aufnahme, in its sense of recording, is segmented into two words, then more paths in the lattices become plausible translations.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"However, using a strategy of “over segmentation” and relying on phrase models to learn the non-compositional translations has been shown to degrade translation quality significantly on several tasks (Xu et al., 2004; Habash and Sadat, 2006).","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
We thus desire lattices containing as little oversegmentation as possible.,"{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
We have now have a concept of a “gold standard” segmentation lattice for translation: it should contain all linguistically motivated segmentations that also correspond to plausible word-for-word translations into English.,"{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
Figure 2 shows an example of the reference lattice for the two words we just discussed.,"{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"For the experiments in this paper, we generated a development and test set by randomly choosing 19 German newspaper articles, identifying all words greater than 6 characters is length, and segmenting each word so that the resulting units could be translated compositionally into English.","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
"This resulted in 489 training sentences corresponding to 564 paths for the dev set (which was drawn from 15 articles), and 279 words (302 paths) for the test set (drawn from the remaining 4 articles).","{'title': '2 Segmentation lattice translation', 'number': '2'}"
We now turn to the problem of modeling word segmentation in a way that facilitates lattice construction.,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"As a starting point, we consider the work of Koehn and Knight (2003) who observe that in most languages that exhibit compounding, the morphemes used to construct compounds frequently also appear as individual tokens.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Based on this observation, they propose a model of word segmentation that splits compound words into pieces found in the dictionary based on a variety heuristic scoring criteria.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"While these models have been reasonably successful (Koehn et al., 2008), they are problematic for two reasons.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"First, there is no principled way to incorporate additional features (such as phonotactics) which might be useful to determining whether a word break should occur.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, the heuristic scoring offers little insight into which segmentations should be included in a lattice.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"We would like our model to consider a wide variety of segmentations of any word (including perhaps hypothesized morphemes that are not in the dictionary), to make use of a rich set of features, and to have a probabilistic interpretation of each hypothesized split (to incorporate into the downstream decoder).","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"We decided to use the class of maximum entropy models, which are probabilistically sound, can make use of possibly many overlapping features, and can be trained efficiently (Berger et al., 1996).","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"We thus define a model of the conditional probability distribution Pr(sN1 Iw), where w is a surface form and sN1 is the segmented form consisting of N segments as: Nexp Ei λihi(s1 , w) (4 ) To simplify inference and to make the lattice representation more natural, we only make use of local feature functions that depend on properties of each segment: The segmentation model just introduced is equivalent to a lattice where each vertex corresponds to a particular coverage (in terms of letters consumed from left to right) of the input word.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Since we only make use of local features, the number of vertices in a lattice for word w is |w |− m, where m is the minimum segment length permitted.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"In all experiments reported in this paper, we use m = 3.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Each edge is labeled with a morpheme s (corresponding to the morpheme associated with characters delimited by the start and end nodes of the edge) as well as a weight, Pi Aihi(s, w).","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
The cost of any path from the start to the goal vertex will be equal to the numerator in equation (4).,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
The value of the denominator can be computed using the forward algorithm.,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"In most of our experiments, s will be identical to the substring of w that the edge is designated to cover.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"However, this is not a requirement.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, German compounds frequently have so-called Fugenelemente, one or two characters that “glue together” the primary morphemes in a compound.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Since we permit these characters to be deleted, then an edge where they are deleted will have fewer characters than the coverage indicated by the edge’s starting and ending vertices.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Except for the minimum segment length restriction, our model defines probabilities for all segmentations of an input word, making the resulting segmentation lattices are quite large.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Since large lattices are costly to deal with during translation (and may lead to worse translations because poor segmentations are passed to the decoder), we prune them using forward-backward pruning so as to contain just the highest probability paths (Sixtus and Ortmanns, 1999).","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
This works by computing the score of the best path passing through every edge in the lattice using the forward-backward algorithm.,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"By finding the best score overall, we can then prune edges using a threshold criterion; i.e., edges whose score is some factor α away from the global best edge score.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Our model defines a conditional probability distribution over virtually all segmentations of a word w. To train our model, we wish to maximize the likelihood of the segmentations contained in the reference lattices by moving probability mass away from the segmentations that are not in the reference lattice.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, we wish to minimize the following objective (which can be computed using the forward algorithm over the unpruned hypothesis lattices): To compute these values, the first expectation is computed using forward-backward inference over the full lattice.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"To compute the second expectation, the full lattice is intersected with the reference lattice Ri, and then forward-backward inference is redone.2 We use the standard quasi-Newtonian method L-BFGS to optimize the model (Liu et al., 1989).","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
Training generally converged in only a few hundred iterations.,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"In some cases, such as when performing word alignment for translation model construction, lattices cannot be used easily.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"In these cases, a 1best segmentation (which can be determined from the lattice using the Viterbi algorithm) may be desired.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"To train the parameters of the model for this condition (which is arguably slightly different from the lattice generation case we just considered), we used the minimum error training (MERT) algorithm on the segmentation lattices to find the parameters that minimized the error on our dev set (Macherey et al., 2008).","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"The error function we used was WER (the minimum number of insertions, substitutions, and deletions along any path in the reference lattice, normalized by the length of this path).","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"The WER on the held-out test set for a system tuned using MERT is 9.9%, compared to 11.1% for maximum likelihood training.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"We remark that since we did not have the resources to generate training data in all the languages we wished to generate segmentation lattices for, we have confined ourselves to features that we expect to be reasonably informative for a broad class of languages.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"A secondary advantage of this is that we used denser features than are often used in maximum entropy modeling, meaning that we could train our model with relatively less training data than might otherwise be required.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
The features we used in our compound segmentation model for the experiments reported below are shown in Table 2.,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"

|si |refers to the number of letters in the ith hypothesized segment.,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
Binary predicates evaluate to 1 when true and 0 otherwise. f(si) is the frequency of the token si as an independent word in a monolingual corpus. p(#|si1 · · · si4) is the probability of a word start preceding the letters si1 · · · si4.,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"We found it beneficial to include a feature that was the probability of a certain string of characters beginning a word, for which we used a reverse 5-gram character model and predicted the word boundary given the first five letters of the hypothesized word split.3 Since we did have expertise in German morphology, we did build a special German model.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"For this, we permitted the strings s, n, and es to be deleted between words.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
Each deletion fired a count feature (listed as fugen in the table).,"{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"Analysis of errors indicated that the segmenter would periodically propose an incorrect segmentation where a single word could be divided into a word and a nonword consisting of common in3In general, this helped avoid situations where a word may be segemented into a frequent word and then a non-word string of characters since the non-word typically violated the phonotactics of the language in some way.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"

"To address this, an additional feature was added that fired when a proposed segment was one of a set N of 30 nonwords that we saw quite frequently.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"The weights shown in Table 2 are those learned by maximum likelihood training on models both with and without the special German features, which are indicated with †.","{'title': '3 A maximum entropy segmentation model', 'number': '3'}"
"To give some sense of the performance of the model in terms of its ability to generate lattices independently of a translation task, we present precision and recall of segmentations for pruning parameters (cf.","{'title': '4 Model evalatuion', 'number': '4'}"

Corpus statistics for all language pairs are summarized in Table 3.,"{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"We note that in all language pairs, the 1BEST segmentation variant of the training data results in a significant reduction in types.","{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Word alignment was carried out by running Giza++ implementation of IBM Model 4 initialized with 5 iterations of Model 1, 5 of the HMM aligner, and 3 iterations of Model 4 (Och and Ney, 2003) in both directions and then symmetrizing using the grow-diag-final-and heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003).","{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For each language pair, the corpus was aligned twice, once in its non-segmented variant and once using the single-best segmentation variant.","{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For translation, we used a bottom-up parsing decoder that uses cube pruning to intersect the language model with the target side of the synchronous grammar.","{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The grammar rules were extracted from the word aligned parallel corpus and scored as described in Chiang (2007).,"{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The features used by the decoder were the English language model log probability, log f(¯e |¯f), the ‘lexical translation’ log probabilities in both directions (Koehn et al., 2003), and a word count feature.","{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"

"Targeted analysis of the translation output shows that while both the 1BEST and LATTICE systems generally produce adequate translations of compound words that are out of vocabulary in the BASELINE system, the LATTICE system performs better since it recovers from infelicitous splits that the one-best segmenter makes.","{'title': '5 Translation experiments', 'number': '5'}"
