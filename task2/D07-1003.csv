"This paper presents a syntax-driven ap proach to question answering, specifically the answer-sentence selection problem forshort-answer questions.",{}
"Rather than using syntactic features to augment exist ing statistical classifiers (as in previouswork), we build on the idea that ques tions and their (correct) answers relate toeach other via loose but predictable syntactic transformations.",{}
"We propose a probabilistic quasi-synchronous grammar, inspired by one proposed for machine translation (D. Smith and Eisner, 2006), and parameterized by mixtures of a robust non lexical syntax/alignment model with a(n optional) lexical-semantics-driven log-linear model.",{}
Our model learns soft alignments as a hidden variable in discriminative training.,{}
Experimental results using the TREC dataset are shown to significantly outperform strong state-of-the-art baselines.,{}
Open-domain question answering (QA) is a widelystudied and fast-growing research problem.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
State of-the-art QA systems are extremely complex.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"They usually take the form of a pipeline architecture, chaining together modules that perform tasks such as answer type analysis (identifying whether the correct answer will be a person, location, date,etc.), document retrieval, answer candidate extrac tion, and answer reranking.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"This architecture is so predominant that each task listed above has evolvedinto its own sub-field and is often studied and evalu ated independently (Shima et al, 2006).","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"At a high level, the QA task boils down to only two essential steps (Echihabi andMarcu, 2003).","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"The first step, retrieval, narrows down the search spacefrom a corpus of millions of documents to a focused set of maybe a few hundred using an IR engine, where efficiency and recall are the main focus.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"The second step, selection, assesses each can didate answer string proposed by the first step, and finds the one that is most likely to be an answerto the given question.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
The granularity of the tar get answer string varies depending on the type ofthe question.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, answers to factoid ques tions (e.g., Who, When, Where) are usually single words or short phrases, while definitional questions and other more complex question types (e.g., How, Why) look for sentences or short passages.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"In this work, we fix the granularity of an answer to a single sentence.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
Earlier work on answer selection relies only on the surface-level text information.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"Two approaches are most common: surface pattern matching, andsimilarity measures on the question and answer, represented as bags of words.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"In the former, pat terns for a certain answer type are either craftedmanually (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001) or acquired from training examples automatically (Itty cheriah et al, 2001; Ravichandran et al, 2003; Licuanan and Weischedel, 2003).","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"In the latter,measures like cosine-similarity are applied to (usu ally) bag-of-words representations of the question and answer.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"Although many of these systems haveachieved very good results in TREC-style evaluations, shallow methods using the bag-of-word repre sentation clearly have their limitations.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
Examples of 22 cases where the bag-of-words approach fails abound in QA literature; here we borrow an example used by Echihabi and Marcu (2003).,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"The question is ?Who is the leader of France??, and the sentence ?Henri Hadjenberg, who is the leader of France ?s Jewish community, endorsed ...?","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"(note tokenization), which is not the correct answer, matches all keywords inthe question in exactly the same order.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
(The cor rect answer is found in ?Bush later met with French President Jacques Chirac.?),"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
This example illustrates two types of variation that need to be recognized in order to connect this question-answer pair.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
The first variation is thechange of the word ?leader?,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
to its semantically re lated term ?president?.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
The second variation is the syntactic shift from ?leader of France?,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
to ?French president.?,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
It is also important to recognize that?France?,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"in the first sentence is modifying ?com munity?, and therefore ?Henri Hadjenberg?","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
is the ?leader of ... community?,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
rather than the ?leader ofFrance.?,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"These syntactic and semantic variations occur in almost every question-answer pair, and typi cally they cannot be easily captured using shallow representations.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"It is also worth noting that such syntactic and semantic variations are not unique to QA; they can be found in many other closely related NLP tasks, motivating extensive community efforts in syntactic and semantic processing.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"Indeed, in this work, we imagine a generative story for QA in which the question is generatedfrom the answer sentence through a series of syn tactic and semantic transformations.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"The same story has been told for machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001, inter alia), in which a target languagesentence (the desired output) has undergone seman tic transformation (word to word translation) and syntactic transformation (syntax divergence acrosslanguages) to generate the source language sen tence (noisy-channel model).","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"Similar stories can also be found in paraphrasing (Quirk et al, 2004; Wu, 2005) and textual entailment (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006; Wu, 2005).","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"Our story makes use of a weighted formalism known as quasi-synchronous grammar (hereafter, QG), originally developed by D. Smith and Eisner(2006) for machine translation.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"Unlike most synchronous formalisms, QG does not posit a strict iso morphism between the two trees, and it providesan elegant description for the set of local configura tions.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 2 we situate our contribution in thecontext of earlier work, and we give a brief discus sion of quasi-synchronous grammars in Section 3.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"Our version of QG, called the Jeopardy model, and our parameter estimation method are described inSection 4.","{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
Experimental results comparing our ap proach to two state-of-the-art baselines are presented in Section 5.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
We discuss portability to cross-lingual QA and other applied semantic processing tasks in Section 6.,"{'title': 'Motivation', 'number': '1'}"
"To model the syntactic transformation process, re searchers in these fields?especially in machine translation?have developed powerful grammatical formalisms and statistical models for representing and learning these tree-to-tree relations (Wu and Wong, 1998; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al, 2005;Galley et al, 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2006, in ter alia).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"We can also observe a trend in recent work in textual entailment that more emphasis is put onexplicit learning of the syntactic graph mapping between the entailed and entailed-by sentences (Mac Cartney et al, 2006).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"However, relatively fewer attempts have been made in the QA community.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"As pointed out by Katz and Lin (2003), most early experiments in QA that tried to bring in syntactic or semantic features showed little or no improvement, and itwas often the case that performance actually de graded (Litkowski, 1999; Attardi et al, 2001).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Morerecent attempts have tried to augment the bag-of words representation?which, after all, is simply a real-valued feature vector?with syntactic features.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
The usual similarity measures can then be used onthe new feature representation.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, Punyakanok et al (2004) used approximate tree match ing and tree-edit-distance to compute a similarity score between the question and answer parse trees.Similarly, Shen et al (2005) experimented with de pendency tree kernels to compute similarity between parse trees.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
Cui et al (2005) measured sentencesimilarity based on similarity measures between de pendency paths among aligned words.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
They used heuristic functions similar to mutual information to 23 assign scores to matched pairs of dependency links.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Shen and Klakow (2006) extend the idea furtherthrough the use of log-linear models to learn a scor ing function for relation pairs.Echihabi and Marcu (2003) presented a noisy channel approach in which they adapted the IBM model 4 from statistical machine translation (Brown et al, 1990; Brown et al, 1993) and applied it to QA.Similarly, Murdock and Croft (2005) adopted a sim ple translation model from IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al, 1993) and applied it to QA.Porting the translation model to QA is not straight forward; it involves parse-tree pruning heuristics (the first two deterministic steps in Echihabi andMarcu, 2003) and also replacing the lexical trans lation table with a monolingual ?dictionary?","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
which simply encodes the identity relation.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
This brings usto the question that drives this work: is there a statistical translation-like model that is natural and accu rate for question answering?,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
We propose Smith andEisner?s (2006) quasi-synchronous grammar (Sec tion 3) as a general solution and the Jeopardy model (Section 4) as a specific instance.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For a formal description of QG, we recommendSmith and Eisner (2006).","{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
We briefly review the central idea here.,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
"QG arose out of the empirical observation that translated sentences often have some isomorphic syntactic structure, but not usually in en tirety, and the strictness of the isomorphism may vary across words or syntactic rules.","{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The idea is that, rather than a synchronous structure over the source and target sentences, a tree over the target sentence is modeled by a source-sentence-specific grammar that is inspired by the source sentence?s tree.1 This is implemented by a ?sense??really just a subsetof nodes in the source tree?attached to each gram mar node in the target tree.","{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
The senses define an alignment between the trees.,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
Because it only loosely links the two sentences?,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"

A concrete example that is easy to understand is a binary quasi-synchronous context-free grammar 1Smith and Eisner also show how QG formalisms generalize synchronous grammar formalisms.(denoted QCFG).,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
Let VS be the set of constituent to kens in the source tree.,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"

QG can be made more or less ?lib eral?,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
"by constraining the cardinality of the Si (weforce all |Si| = 1), and by constraining the relation ships among the Si mentioned in a single rule.","{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
These are called permissible ?configurations.?,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
An example of a strict configuration is that a target parent-childpair must align (respectively) to a source parent child pair.,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
Configurations are shown in Table 1.,"{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Here, following Smith and Eisner (2006), we usea weighted, quasi-synchronous dependency grammar.","{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Apart from the obvious difference in appli cation task, there are a few important differences with their model.","{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
"First, we are not interested in thealignments per se; we will sum them out as a hid den variable when scoring a question-answer pair.","{'title': 'Quasi-Synchronous Grammar. ', 'number': '3'}"
