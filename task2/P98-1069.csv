Most of these techniques aim at efficient online search for information already on the Web.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Meanwhile, the corpus linguistic community regards the WWW as a vast potential of corpus resources.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It is now possible to download a large amount of texts with automatic tools when one needs to compute, for example, a list of synonyms; or download domain-specific monolingual texts by specifying a keyword to the search engine, and then use this text to extract domain-specific terms.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
It remains to be seen how we can also make use of the multilingual texts as NLP resources.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In the years since the appearance of the first papers on using statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and machine translation(Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard et al., 1992), large amount of human effort and time has been invested in collecting parallel corpora of translated texts.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our goal is to alleviate this effort and enlarge the scope of corpus resources by looking into monolingual, comparable texts.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This type of texts are known as nonparallel corpora.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Such nonparallel, monolingual texts should be much more prevalent than parallel texts.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, previous attempts at using nonparallel corpora for terminology translation were constrained by the inadequate availability of same-domain, comparable texts in electronic form.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The type of nonparallel texts obtained from the LDC or university libraries were often restricted, and were usually out-of-date as soon as they became available.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For new word translation, the timeliness of corpus resources is a prerequisite, so is the continuous and automatic availability of nonparallel, comparable texts in electronic form.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Data collection effort should not inhibit the actual translation effort.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Fortunately, nowadays the World Wide Web provides us with a daily increase of fresh, up-to-date multilingual material, together with the archived versions, all easily downloadable by software tools running in the background.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It is possible to specify the URL of the online site of a newspaper, and the start and end dates, and automatically download all the daily newspaper materials between those dates.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we describe a new method which combines IR and NLP techniques to extract new word translation from automatically downloaded English-Chinese nonparallel newspaper texts.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"To improve the performance of a machine translation system, it is often necessary to update its bilingual lexicon, either by human lexicographers or statistical methods using large corpora.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"Up until recently, statistical bilingual lexicon compilation relies largely on parallel corpora.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
This is an undesirable constraint at times.,"{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"In using a broad-coverage English-Chinese MT system to translate some text recently, we discovered that it is unable to translate Mel! liougan which occurs very frequently in the text.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"Other words which the system cannot find in its 20,000-entry lexicon include proper names such as the Taiwanese president Lee Teng-Hui, and the Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung CheeHwa.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"To our disappointment, we cannot locate any parallel texts which include such words since they only start to appear frequently in recent months.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
A quick search on the Web turned up archives of multiple local newspapers in English and Chinese.,"{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"Our challenge is to find the translation of 1.,133 I liougan and other words from this online nonparallel, comparable corpus of newspaper materials.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"We choose to use issues of the English newspaper Hong Kong Standard and the Chinese newspaper Mingpao, from Dec.12,97 to Dec.31,97, as our corpus.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
The English text contains about 3 Mb of text whereas the Chinese text contains 8.8 Mb of 2 byte character texts.,"{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
So both texts are comparable in size.,"{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"Since they are both local mainstream newspapers, it is reasonable to assume that their contents are comparable as well.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"Unlike in parallel texts, the position of a word in a text does not give us information about its translation in the other language.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"(Rapp, 1995; Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggest that a content word is closely associated with some words in its context.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"As a tutorial example, we postulate that the words which appear in the context ofMet, Iliougan should be similar to the words appearing in the context of its English translation, flu.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"We can form a vector space model of a word in terms of its context word indices, similar to the vector space model of a text in terms of its constituent word indices (Salton and Buckley, 1988; Salton and Yang, 1973; Croft, 1984; Turtle and Croft, 1992; Bookstein, 1983; Korfhage, 1995; Jones, 1979).","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
The value of the i-th dimension of a word vector W is f if the i-th word in the lexicon appears f times in the same sentences as W. Left columns in Table 1 and Table 2 show the list of content words which appear most frequently in the context of flu and Africa respectively.,"{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
"The right column shows those which occur most frequently in the context of bv,g.","{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
We can see that the context of At is more similar to that of flu than to that of Africa.,"{'title': '2 Encountering new words', 'number': '2'}"
So the first clue to the similarity between a word and its translation number of common words in their contexts.,"{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"In a bilingual corpus, the &quot;common word&quot; is actually a bilingual word pair.","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
We use the lexicon of the MT system to &quot;bridge&quot; all bilingual word pairs in the corpora.,"{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
These word pairs are used as seed words.,"{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"We found that the contexts of flu and 'MI Iliougan share 233 &quot;common&quot; context words, whereas the contexts of Africa and W„Iff Iliougan share only 121 common words, even though the context of flu has 491 unique words and the context of Africa has 328 words.","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"In the vector space model, W[flu] and W[liougan] has 233 overlapping dimensions, whereas there are 121 overlapping dimensions between W[flu] and W [Africa].","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
The flu example illustrates that the actual ranking of the context word frequencies provides a second clue to the similarity between a bilingual word pair.,"{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, virus ranks very high for both flu and ME Iliougan and is a strong &quot;bridge&quot; between this bilingual word pair.","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
This leads us to use the term frequency(TF) measure.,"{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
The TF of a context word is defined as the frequency of the word in the context of W. (e.g.,"{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"TF of virus in flu is 26, in MM. is 147).","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"However, the TF of a word is not independent of its general usage frequency.","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"In an extreme case, the function word the appears most frequently in English texts and would have the highest TF in the context of any W. In our HKStandard/Mingpao corpus, Hong Kong is the most frequent content word which appears everywhere.","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"So in the flu example, we would like to reduce the significance of Hong Kong's TF while keeping that of virus.","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
A common way to account for this difference is by using the inverse document frequency(IDF).,"{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"Among the variants of IDF, we choose the following representation from (Jones, 1979):","{'title': '4 Bilingual lexicon as seed words', 'number': '3'}"
"Next, a ranking algorithm is needed to match the unknown word vectors to their counterparts in the other language.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"A ranking algorithm selects the best target language candidate for a source language word according to direct comparison of some similarity measures (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"We modify the similarity measure proposed by (Salton and Buckley, 1988) into the following SO: where maxn = ni the maximum frequency of any word in the corpus the total number of occurrences of word i in the corpus SO(We, We) = where wic = wie = (wieX wie) VELiwic2 x ELiwie2 TFic TFie The IDF of virus is 1.81 and that of Hong Kong is 1.23 in the English text.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
The IDF of WS is 1.92 and that of Hong Kong is 0.83 in Chinese.,"{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"So in both cases, virus is a stronger &quot;bridge&quot; for biglliougan than Hong Kong.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"Hence, for every context seed word i, we assign a word weighting factor (Salton and Buckley, 1988) w = TFiw x IDFi where TFiw is the TF of word i in the context of word W. The updated vector space model of word W has wi in its i-th dimension.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"The ranking of the 20 words in the contexts of W,,,f3 Iliougan is rearranged by this weighting factor as shown in Table3.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"Variants of similarity measures such as the above have been used extensively in the IR community (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
They are mostly based on the Cosine Measure of two vectors.,"{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"For different tasks, the weighting factor might vary.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, if we add the IDF into the weighting factor, we get the following measure Si: where wic = TFic x IDF, wie = TFie x IDFi In addition, the Dice and Jaccard coefficients are also suitable similarity measures for document comparison (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"We also implement the Dice coefficient into similarity measure S2: where wic = TFie x IDFi Si is often used in comparing a short query with a document text, whereas S2 is used in comparing two document texts.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"Reasoning that our objective falls somewhere in between—we are comparing segments of a document, we also multiply the above two measures into a third similarity measure S3.","{'title': '6 Ranking translation candidates', 'number': '4'}"
"In using bilingual seed words such asN,Et /virus as &quot;bridges&quot; for terminology translation, the quality of the bilingual seed lexicon naturally affects the system output.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"In the case of European language pairs such as French-English, we can envision using words sharing common cognates as these &quot;bridges&quot;.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"Most importantly, we can assume that the word boundaries are similar in French and English.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"However, the situation is messier with English and Chinese.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"First, segmentation of the Chinese text into words already introduces some ambiguity of the seed word identities.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"Secondly, English-Chinese translations are complicated by the fact that the two languages share very little stemming properties, or part-of-speech set, or word order.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
This property causes every English word to have many Chinese translations and vice versa.,"{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"In a source-target language translation scenario, the translated text can be &quot;rearranged&quot; and cleaned up by a monolingual language model in the target language.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"However, the lexicon is not very reliable in establishing &quot;bridges&quot; between nonparallel English-Chinese texts.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
"To compensate for this ambiguity in the seed lexicon, we introduce a confidence weighting to each bilingual word pair used as seed words.","{'title': '7 Confidence on seed word pairs', 'number': '5'}"
