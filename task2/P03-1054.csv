"Since we expressly do not smooth the grammar, not all splits are guaranteed to be beneficial, and not all sets of useful splits are guaranteed to co-exist well. particular, while markovization is good on its own, it has a large number of states and does not tolerate further splitting well.",{}

"Although it does not necessarily jump out of the grid at first glance, this point represents the best compromise between a compact grammar and useful markov histories.",{}
"3 External vs. Internal Annotation The two major previous annotation strategies, parent annotation and head lexicalization, can be seen as instances of external and internal annotation, respectively.",{}
Parent annotation lets us indicate an important feature of the external environment of a node which influences the internal expansion of that node.,{}
"On the other hand, lexicalization is a (radical) method of marking a distinctive aspect of the otherwise hidden internal contents of a node which influence the external distribution.",{}
Both kinds of annotation can be useful.,{}
"To identify split states, we suffixes of the form mark internal content and mark external features.",{}
"To illustrate the difference, consider unary productions.",{}
"In the raw grammar, there are many unaries, and once any major category is constructed over a span, most others become constructible as well using unary chains (see Klein and Manning (2001) for discussion).",{}
"Such chains are rare in real treebank trees: unary rewrites only appear in very specific for example of verbs where an empty, controlled subject.",{}
"Figure 4 shows an erroneous output of the parser, using the baseline markovized grammar.",{}
"Intuitively, there are several reasons this parse should be ruled out, but is that the lower which is intended prifor of communication verbs, is not a unary rewrite position (such complements usually have subjects).",{}
It would therefore be natural to annotate the trees so as to confine unary productions to the contexts in which they are actually ap- We tried two annotations.,{}

One distributionally salient tag conflation in the Penn treebank is the identification of demonstraand regular determiners based on whether they were only captured this distinction.,{}
"The same external unary annotation was even more efwhen applied to adverbs disfor example, well Beyond these cases, unary tag marking was detrimen- The 78.86%.",{}
4 Tag Splitting The idea that part-of-speech tags are not fine-grained enough to abstract away from specific-word behaviour is a cornerstone of lexicalization.,{}
"The for example, showed that the determiners which occur alone are usefully distinguished from those which occur with other nomimaterial.",{}
This marks the with a single bit about their immediate external context: whether there are sisters.,{}
"Given the success of parent annotation for nonterminals, it makes sense to parent antags, as well In fact, as figure 3 shows, exhaustively marking all preterminals with their parent category was the most effective single annotation we tried.",{}
Why should this be useful?,{}
Most tags have a canonical category.,{}
"For example, occur under (only 234 of 70855 do not, mostly mistakes).",{}
"However, when a tag that when we show such trees, we generally only show one annotation on top of the baseline at a time.",{}
"Moreover, we do not explicitly show the binarization implicit by the horizontal markovization. two are not equivalent even given infinite data.",{}
"5: An error resolved with the (of the (a) the incorrect baseline parse and (b) the correct resolves this error. somewhat regularly occurs in a non-canonical position, its distribution is usually distinct.",{}
"For example, most common adverbs directly under and Under they are and Under and and so on. substantially, to 80.62%.",{}
"In addition to the adverb case, the Penn tag set conflates various grammatical distinctions that are commonly made in traditional and generative grammar, and from which a parser could hope to get useful information.",{}
"For example, subordinating conas, complementizers prepositions in, all get the tag of these distinctions are captured by conjunctions occur under under but are not (both subordinating conjunctions and complementizers appear Also, there are exclusively nounprepositions predominantly verbones and so on.",{}
The annotation a linguistically motivated 6-way split the and brought the total to 81.19%.,{}
"Figure 5 shows an example error in the baseline is equally well fixed by either In this case, the more common nominal of preferred unless the is annoto allow prefer We also got value from three other annotations which subcategorized tags for specific lexemes. we split off auxiliary verbs with the which appends all forms all forms of More miconjunction tags to indicate is an extended uniform version of the partial auxiliary annotation of Charniak (1997), wherein all auxiliaries are as a added to gerund auxiliaries and VP&quot;S VP&quot;S TO VP&quot;VP TO&quot;VP VP&quot;VP to VB PP&quot;VP to VB&quot;VP SBAR&quot;VP see NP&quot;PP see IN&quot;SBAR S&quot;SBAR IN (a) (b) NNS NN if VP&quot;S VBZ&quot;VP works works NN&quot;NP advertising advertising or not they were the strings &, each of which have distinctly different distributions from other conjunctions.",{}
"Finally, we gave the percent sign (%) its own tag, in line with the dollar sign ($) already having its own.",{}
Together these three anbrought the 81.81%.,{}
5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?,{}
"Around this point, we must address exactly what we by an To the extent that go about subcategorizing many of them might come to represent a single word.",{}
"One might thus feel that the approach of this paper is to walk down a slippery slope, and that we are merely arguing degrees.",{}
"However, we believe that there is a fundamental qualitative distinction, grounded in linguistic practice, between what we see as permitted an unlexicalized against what one finds hopes to exploit in lexicalized The division rests on the traditional distinction between words closed-class words) and open class or lexical words).",{}
"It is standard practice in linguistics, dating back decades, to annotate phrasal nodes with important functiondistinctions, for example to have a a whereas content words are not part of grammatical structure, and one would not have sperules or constraints for an for example.",{}
"We follow this approach in our model: various closed classes are subcategorized to better represent important distinctions, and important features commonly expressed by function words are annotated phrasal nodes (such as whether a finite, or a participle, or an infinitive clause).",{}
"However, no use is made of lexical class words, to provide either or bilexical At any rate, we have kept ourselves honest by estimating our models exclusively by maximum likelihood estimation over our subcategorized grammar, without any form of interpolation or shrinkage to unsubcategorized categories (although we do rules, as explained above).",{}
"This effecshould be noted that we started with four tags in the Penn tagset that rewrite as a single word: and some of the punctuation tags, which rewrite as barely more.",{}
"To the extent that we subcategorize tags, there will be more such cases, but many of them already exist in other tag sets.",{}
"For instance, many tag sets, such as the Brown and tagsets give a separate sets of tags to each form of verbal auxiliaries and most of which rewrite as only a single word (and any corresponding contractions).",{}
6: An error resolved with the (a) incorrect baseline parse and (b) the correct tively means that the subcategories that we break off must themselves be very frequent in the language.,{}
"In such a framework, if we try to annotate categories with any detailed lexical information, many sentences either entirely fail to parse, or have only extremely weird parses.",{}
The resulting battle against sparsity means that we can only afford to make a few distinctions which have major distributional impact.,{}
"Even with the individual-lexeme annotations in this section, the grammar still has only 9255 states compared to the 7619 of the baseline model.",{}
"6 Annotations Already in the Treebank At this point, one might wonder as to the wisdom of stripping off all treebank functional tags, only to heuristically add other such markings back in to the grammar.",{}
"By and large, the treebank out-of-the tags, such as have negative utility.",{}
"Recall that the raw treebank gramwith no annotation or markovization, had an of 72.62% on our development set.",{}
"With the functional annotation left in, this drops to 71.49%.",{}
"The v markovization baseline of 77.77% dropped even further, all the way to 72.87%, when these annotations were included.",{}
"Nonetheless, some distinctions present in the raw trees were valuable.",{}
"For example, an an could be either a temporal a For the annotation we retained the on and, furthermore, propathe tag down to the tag of the head of the This is illustrated in figure 6, which also shows an of its utility, clarifying that last night is not a plausible compound and facilitating the othunusual high attachment of the smaller the cumulative 82.25%.",{}

"Following (1999), the annotation nodes which have an empty subject (i.e., raising and constructions).",{}
This brought 82.28%.,{}
7 Head Annotation The notion that the head word of a constituent can affect its behavior is a useful one.,{}
"However, often the head tag is as good (or better) an indicator of how constituent will We found several head annotations to be particularly effective.",{}
"First, poshave a very different distribution than – in particular, are only used in the treebank when the leftmost child is possessive (as opposed to other imaginable uses like for York which is left flat).",{}
"To address this, all possessive This brought total 83.06%.",{}
"Second, the is very overloaded in the Penn treebank, most severely in that there is no distinction between finite and in- An example of the damage this conflation can do is given in figure 7, where one needs to capture the fact that present-tense verbs do not take bare infinitive To allow the finite/non-finite distinction, and other verb distinctions, all with their head tag, merging all finite forms to a sintag In particular, this also accomplished This was extremely bringing the cumulative 85.72%, 2.66% absolute improvement (more than its solo improvement over the baseline). is part of the explanation of why (Charniak, 2000) finds that early generation of head tags as in (Collins, 1999) is so beneficial.",{}
The rest of the benefit is presumably in the availability of the tags for smoothing purposes.,{}
Error analysis at this point suggested that many remaining errors were attachment level and conjunction scope.,{}
"While these kinds of errors are undoubtedly profitable targets for lexical preference, most attachment mistakes were overly high attachments, indicating that the overall right-branching tendency of English was not being captured.",{}
"Indeed, this tenis a difficult trend to capture in a because often the high and low attachments involve the very same rules.",{}
"Even if not, attachment height is modeled by a it is somehow explicitly encoded into category labels.",{}
"More complex parsing models have indirectly overcome this by modeling distance (rather than height). distance is difficult to encode in a – marking nodes with the size of their yields masmultiplies the state Therefore, we wish to find indirect indicators that distinguish high from low ones.",{}
"In the case of two a with the question of whether the a second modifier of the leftmost should attach lower, inside the first the important distinction is usually that the lower site is a base Collins (1999) captures this by introducing the notion of a base in any dominates only preterminals is with a Further, if an not have non-base it is given one with a unary production.",{}
"This was helpful, but substantially less than marking base the unary, whose presence actually erased a useful indicator – base are more frequent in subject position than object position, for example.",{}
"In isolation, the Collins method actually hurt the base- (absolute cost to 0.37%), while skipping the unary insertion added an absolute 0.73% to the and brought the cumulative 86.04%. the case of attachment of a an eiabove or inside a relative clause, the high is distinct from the low one in that the already modified one contains a verb (and the low one may be base well).",{}
This is a partial explanation of the utility of verbal distance in Collins (1999).,{}

"One way of capturing this kind of external context is to use parent annotation, as presented in Johnson (1998).","{'title': '1 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, NPs with S parents (like subjects) will be marked NP&quot;S, while NPs with VP parents (like objects) will be NP&quot;VP.","{'title': '1 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"The second basic deficiency is that many rule types have been seen only once (and therefore have their probabilities overestimated), and many rules which occur in test sentences will never have been seen in training (and therefore have their probabilities underestimated – see Collins (1999) for analysis).","{'title': '1 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"Note that in parsing with the unsplit grammar, not having seen a rule doesn’t mean one gets a parse failure, but rather a possibly very weird parse (Charniak, 1996).","{'title': '1 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"

"Intuitively, there are several reasons this parse should be ruled out, but one is that the lower S slot, which is intended primarily for S complements of communication verbs, is not a unary rewrite position (such complements usually have subjects).","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
It would therefore be natural to annotate the trees so as to confine unary productions to the contexts in which they are actually appropriate.,"{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
We tried two annotations.,"{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"First, UNARYINTERNAL marks (with a -U) any nonterminal node which has only one child.","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"In isolation, this resulted in an absolute gain of 0.55% (see figure 3).","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"The same sentence, parsed using only the baseline and UNARY-INTERNAL, is parsed correctly, because the VP rewrite in the incorrect parse ends with an S&quot;VPU with very low probability.8 Alternately, UNARY-EXTERNAL, marked nodes which had no siblings with &quot;U.","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"It was similar to UNARY-INTERNAL in solo benefit (0.01% worse), but provided far less marginal benefit on top of other later features (none at all on top of UNARYINTERNAL for our top models), and was discarded.9 One restricted place where external unary annotation was very useful, however, was at the preterminal level, where internal annotation was meaningless.","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"One distributionally salient tag conflation in the Penn treebank is the identification of demonstratives (that, those) and regular determiners (the, a).","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
Splitting DT tags based on whether they were only children (UNARY-DT) captured this distinction.,"{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"The same external unary annotation was even more effective when applied to adverbs (UNARY-RB), distinguishing, for example, as well from also).","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Beyond these cases, unary tag marking was detrimental.","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"The F1 after UNARY-INTERNAL, UNARY-DT, and UNARY-RB was 78.86%.","{'title': '3 External vs. Internal Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
The idea that part-of-speech tags are not fine-grained enough to abstract away from specific-word behaviour is a cornerstone of lexicalization.,"{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"The UNARY-DT annotation, for example, showed that the determiners which occur alone are usefully distinguished from those which occur with other nominal material.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
This marks the DT nodes with a single bit about their immediate external context: whether there are sisters.,"{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"Given the success of parent annotation for nonterminals, it makes sense to parent annotate tags, as well (TAG-PA).","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"In fact, as figure 3 shows, exhaustively marking all preterminals with their parent category was the most effective single annotation we tried.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
Why should this be useful?,"{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
Most tags have a canonical category.,"{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, NNS tags occur under NP nodes (only 234 of 70855 do not, mostly mistakes).","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"However, when a tag somewhat regularly occurs in a non-canonical position, its distribution is usually distinct.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, the most common adverbs directly under ADVP are also (1599) and now (544).","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"Under VP, they are n’t (3779) and not (922).","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"Under NP, only (215) and just (132), and so on.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"TAG-PA brought F1 up substantially, to 80.62%.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"In addition to the adverb case, the Penn tag set conflates various grammatical distinctions that are commonly made in traditional and generative grammar, and from which a parser could hope to get useful information.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, subordinating conjunctions (while, as, if), complementizers (that, for), and prepositions (of, in, from) all get the tag IN.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"Many of these distinctions are captured by TAGPA (subordinating conjunctions occur under S and prepositions under PP), but are not (both subordinating conjunctions and complementizers appear under SBAR).","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"Also, there are exclusively nounmodifying prepositions (of), predominantly verbmodifying ones (as), and so on.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"The annotation SPLIT-IN does a linguistically motivated 6-way split of the IN tag, and brought the total to 81.19%.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
Figure 5 shows an example error in the baseline which is equally well fixed by either TAG-PA or SPLIT-IN.,"{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"In this case, the more common nominal use of works is preferred unless the IN tag is annotated to allow if to prefer S complements.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
We also got value from three other annotations which subcategorized tags for specific lexemes.,"{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"First we split off auxiliary verbs with the SPLITAUX annotation, which appends &quot;BE to all forms of be and &quot;HAVE to all forms of have.10 More minorly, SPLIT-CC marked conjunction tags to indicate whether or not they were the strings [Bb]ut or &, each of which have distinctly different distributions from other conjunctions.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"Finally, we gave the percent sign (%) its own tag, in line with the dollar sign ($) already having its own.","{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
Together these three annotations brought the F1 to 81.81%.,"{'title': '4 Tag Splitting', 'number': '4'}"
"Around this point, we must address exactly what we mean by an unlexicalized PCFG.","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"To the extent that we go about subcategorizing POS categories, many of them might come to represent a single word.","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"One might thus feel that the approach of this paper is to walk down a slippery slope, and that we are merely arguing degrees.","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"However, we believe that there is a fundamental qualitative distinction, grounded in linguistic practice, between what we see as permitted in an unlexicalized PCFG as against what one finds and hopes to exploit in lexicalized PCFGs.","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
The division rests on the traditional distinction between function words (or closed-class words) and content words (or open class or lexical words).,"{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"It is standard practice in linguistics, dating back decades, to annotate phrasal nodes with important functionword distinctions, for example to have a CP[for] or a PP[to], whereas content words are not part of grammatical structure, and one would not have special rules or constraints for an NP[stocks], for example.","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"We follow this approach in our model: various closed classes are subcategorized to better represent important distinctions, and important features commonly expressed by function words are annotated onto phrasal nodes (such as whether a VP is finite, or a participle, or an infinitive clause).","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"However, no use is made of lexical class words, to provide either monolexical or bilexical probabilities.11 At any rate, we have kept ourselves honest by estimating our models exclusively by maximum likelihood estimation over our subcategorized grammar, without any form of interpolation or shrinkage to unsubcategorized categories (although we do markovize rules, as explained above).","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
This effectively means that the subcategories that we break off must themselves be very frequent in the language.,"{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"In such a framework, if we try to annotate categories with any detailed lexical information, many sentences either entirely fail to parse, or have only extremely weird parses.","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
The resulting battle against sparsity means that we can only afford to make a few distinctions which have major distributional impact.,"{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"Even with the individual-lexeme annotations in this section, the grammar still has only 9255 states compared to the 7619 of the baseline model.","{'title': '5 What is an Unlexicalized Grammar?', 'number': '5'}"
"At this point, one might wonder as to the wisdom of stripping off all treebank functional tags, only to heuristically add other such markings back in to the grammar.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"By and large, the treebank out-of-the package tags, such as PP-LOC or ADVP-TMP, have negative utility.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"Recall that the raw treebank grammar, with no annotation or markovization, had an F1 of 72.62% on our development set.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"With the functional annotation left in, this drops to 71.49%.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"The h < 2, v < 1 markovization baseline of 77.77% dropped even further, all the way to 72.87%, when these annotations were included.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"Nonetheless, some distinctions present in the raw treebank trees were valuable.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, an NP with an S parent could be either a temporal NP or a subject.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"For the annotation TMP-NP, we retained the original -TMP tags on NPs, and, furthermore, propagated the tag down to the tag of the head of the NP.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"This is illustrated in figure 6, which also shows an example of its utility, clarifying that CNN last night is not a plausible compound and facilitating the otherwise unusual high attachment of the smaller NP.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
TMP-NP brought the cumulative F1 to 82.25%.,"{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"Note that this technique of pushing the functional tags down to preterminals might be useful more generally; for example, locative PPs expand roughly the same way as all other PPs (usually as IN NP), but they do tend to have different prepositions below IN.","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
A second kind of information in the original trees is the presence of empty elements.,"{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
"Following Collins (1999), the annotation GAPPED-S marks S nodes which have an empty subject (i.e., raising and control constructions).","{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
This brought F1 to 82.28%.,"{'title': '6 Annotations Already in the Treebank', 'number': '6'}"
The notion that the head word of a constituent can affect its behavior is a useful one.,"{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"However, often the head tag is as good (or better) an indicator of how a constituent will behave.12 We found several head annotations to be particularly effective.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"First, possessive NPs have a very different distribution than other NPs – in particular, NP → NP α rules are only used in the treebank when the leftmost child is possessive (as opposed to other imaginable uses like for New York lawyers, which is left flat).","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"To address this, POSS-NP marked all possessive NPs.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
This brought the total F1 to 83.06%.,"{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"Second, the VP symbol is very overloaded in the Penn treebank, most severely in that there is no distinction between finite and infinitival VPs.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"An example of the damage this conflation can do is given in figure 7, where one needs to capture the fact that present-tense verbs do not generally take bare infinitive VP complements.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"To allow the finite/non-finite distinction, and other verb type distinctions, SPLIT-VP annotated all VP nodes with their head tag, merging all finite forms to a single tag VBF.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"In particular, this also accomplished Charniak’s gerund-VP marking.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"This was extremely useful, bringing the cumulative F1 to 85.72%, 2.66% absolute improvement (more than its solo improvement over the baseline).","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
Error analysis at this point suggested that many remaining errors were attachment level and conjunction scope.,"{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"While these kinds of errors are undoubtedly profitable targets for lexical preference, most attachment mistakes were overly high attachments, indicating that the overall right-branching tendency of English was not being captured.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"Indeed, this tendency is a difficult trend to capture in a PCFG because often the high and low attachments involve the very same rules.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"Even if not, attachment height is not modeled by a PCFG unless it is somehow explicitly encoded into category labels.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
More complex parsing models have indirectly overcome this by modeling distance (rather than height).,"{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"Linear distance is difficult to encode in a PCFG – marking nodes with the size of their yields massively multiplies the state space.13 Therefore, we wish to find indirect indicators that distinguish high attachments from low ones.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"In the case of two PPs following a NP, with the question of whether the second PP is a second modifier of the leftmost NP or should attach lower, inside the first PP, the important distinction is usually that the lower site is a non-recursive base NP.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"Collins (1999) captures this notion by introducing the notion of a base NP, in which any NP which dominates only preterminals is marked with a -B.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"Further, if an NP-B does not have a non-base NP parent, it is given one with a unary production.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"This was helpful, but substantially less effective than marking base NPs without introducing the unary, whose presence actually erased a useful internal indicator – base NPs are more frequent in subject position than object position, for example.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"In isolation, the Collins method actually hurt the baseline (absolute cost to F1 of 0.37%), while skipping the unary insertion added an absolute 0.73% to the baseline, and brought the cumulative F1 to 86.04%.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"In the case of attachment of a PP to an NP either above or inside a relative clause, the high NP is distinct from the low one in that the already modified one contains a verb (and the low one may be a base NP as well).","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
This is a partial explanation of the utility of verbal distance in Collins (1999).,"{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
To 13The inability to encode distance naturally in a naive PCFG is somewhat ironic.,"{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"In the heart of any PCFG parser, the fundamental table entry or chart item is a label over a span, for example an NP from position 0 to position 5.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"The concrete use of a grammar rule is to take two adjacent span-marked labels and combine them (for example NP[0,5] and VP[5,12] into S[0,12]).","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"Yet, only the labels are used to score the combination. capture this, DOMINATES-V marks all nodes which dominate any verbal node (V*, MD) with a -V. This brought the cumulative F1 to 86.91%.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"We also tried marking nodes which dominated prepositions and/or conjunctions, but these features did not help the cumulative hill-climb.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"The final distance/depth feature we used was an explicit attempt to model depth, rather than use distance and linear intervention as a proxy.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"With RIGHT-REC-NP, we marked all NPs which contained another NP on their right periphery (i.e., as a rightmost descendant).","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
"This captured some further attachment trends, and brought us to a final development F1 of 87.04%.","{'title': '7 Head Annotation', 'number': '7'}"
