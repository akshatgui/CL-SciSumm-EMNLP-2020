An efficient bit-vector-based CKY-style parser for context-free parsing is presented.,{}
The parser computes a compact parse forest representation of the complete set of possible analyses forlarge treebank grammars and long input sen tences.,{}
The parser uses bit-vector operations to parallelise the basic parsing operations.,{}
The parser is particularly useful when all analyses are needed rather than just the most probable one.,{}
"Large context-free grammars extracted from tree banks achieve high coverage and accuracy, but they are difficult to parse with because of their massive ambiguity.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The application of standard chart-parsing techniques often fails due to excessive memory and runtime requirements.Treebank grammars are mostly used as probabilis tic grammars and users are usually only interested in the best analysis, the Viterbi parse.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"To speed up Viterbi parsing, sophisticated search strategies havebeen developed which find the most probable anal ysis without examining the whole set of possible analyses (Charniak et al, 1998; Klein and Manning,2003a).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"These methods reduce the number of gener ated edges, but increase the amount of time needed for each edge.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The parser described in this paper follows a contrary approach: instead of reducing the number of edges, it minimises the costs of building edges in terms of memory and runtime.The new parser, called BitPar, is based on a bit vector implementation (cf.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The CKY algorithm requires a grammar in Chom sky normal form where the right-hand side of eachrule either consists of two non-terminals or a single terminal symbol.,"{'title': 'Grammar Transformation. ', 'number': '2'}"
BitPar uses a modified ver sion of the CKY algorithm allowing also chain rules (rules with a single non-terminal on the right-handside).,"{'title': 'Grammar Transformation. ', 'number': '2'}"
BitPar expects that the input grammar is al ready epsilon-free and that terminal symbols onlyoccur in unary rules.,"{'title': 'Grammar Transformation. ', 'number': '2'}"
Rules with more than 2 non terminals on the right-hand side are split into binaryrules by applying a transformation algorithm pro posed by Andreas Eisele1.,"{'title': 'Grammar Transformation. ', 'number': '2'}"
It is a greedy algorithm which tries to minimise the number of binarised rules by combining frequently cooccurring symbols first.,"{'title': 'Grammar Transformation. ', 'number': '2'}"
