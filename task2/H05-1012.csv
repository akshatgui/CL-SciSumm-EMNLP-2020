This paper presents a maximum entropyword alignment algorithm for Arabic English based on supervised training data.We demonstrate that it is feasible to create training material for problems in machine translation and that a mixture of su pervised and unsupervised methods yields superior performance.,{}
The probabilisticmodel used in the alignment directly models the link decisions.,{}
Significant improvement over traditional word alignment tech niques is shown as well as improvement onseveral machine translation tests.,{}
Perfor mance of the algorithm is contrasted with human annotation performance.,{}

"In order to describe the algorithm, we will need to first describe the direct link model.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
Figure 1 shows two sequences where the top sequence is considered the source sequence and the bottom sequence the target sequence.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Each sequence can have auxilliary information such as Arabic segmentation or English WordNet (Miller, 1990) information as shown.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Given the source and target sequences, there are a number of different ways to link each target word to a sourceword.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
Each target word has a link li which indi cates which source position it links to.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
The range of li is from 0 to K and there are M of these links.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
The source word position 0 is used to indicate NULL which we imagine gives rise to unaligned Englishwords.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, we refer to these words as be ing spontaneous.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
A valid link configuration has M links.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Define L to be the set of all possible valid link configurations, and L to be a member of that set.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"We seek to maximize the alignment probability by finding the optimum link configuration Lopt, p(Lopt|S, T ) = argmax L?L p(L|S, T ) = p(lMi |tM1 , sK1 ) = M ? i=0 p(li|tM1 , sK1 , li?11 ).We factor this into a transition model and an obser vation model, p(L|S, T ) = 1Z M ? i=0 p(li|li?1)?p(li|tM1 , sK1 , li?11 )1??.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"where Z is the normalizing constant.We factor the model as above so that the tran sition model computation, which uses information available on the search hypotheses, is reduced during the search process.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In the aligner presented here, ?is always set to 0.5.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Next we will describe the tran sition model, then the observation model and finallythe experiments in alignment and machine transla tion.In the IBM Model 1 aligner, the choice of the lan guage to serve as states of the search algorithm is not prescribed, but practically the choice is important asit affects performance.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"To see this, note that in gen erative models an input word can only be aligned toa single state in the search.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In our current situation, we are interested in aligning unsegmented Ara bic words and typical words have a few affixes toindicate for example pronouns, definiteness, prepositions and conjunctions.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In English these are sepa rate words, and therefore to maximize performance the unsegmented Arabic words serve as states in the search algorithm and we align English words to these states.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
3.1 Transition Model.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
The transition model tends to keep the alignmentsclose together and penalizes alignments in which ad jacent words in the target language come from very distant words in the source language.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, we would like to penalize many English words coming from the same Arabic state; we call this the state visit penalty and will be described later.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, we use a parametric form for the transition model, p(li|li?1) = 1 Z(li?1) [ 1 dist(li, li?1) + 1ns(li) ] (1) 90 where ns(i) represents the state visit penalty for state i, Z(li?1) is the normalization constant and dist(li, li?1) = min(|li ? li?1|, |li ? fi|) + a. Here a is a penalty for a zero distance transition andis set to 1 in the experiments below.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The min operator chooses the lowest cost transition distance ei ther from the previous state or the frontier state, fi, which is the right most state that has been visited (even though Arabic is normally displayed right to left, we make our Arabic state graphs from left toright).","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
This is a language specific criteria and in tended to model the adjective noun reversal between English and Arabic.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Once the current noun phrase is completed, the next word often aligns to the statejust beyond frontier state.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"As an example, in Fig ure 1, the verb ?pointed?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"aligns to the first Arabic word ?wA$Art?, and aligning the ?to?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
to its Arabic counterpart ?Aly?,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
would incur normally a distance of 3 but with the frontier notion it incurs only a penalty of 1 on the hypothesis that aligns the word ?second?to ?AlvAnyp?.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In this alignment with the frontier no tion, there are only distance 1 transitions, whereas the traditional shapes would incur a penalty of 2 for alignment of ?pointed?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"and a penalty of 3 for the word ?to?.The state visit penalty, ns(i) is the distance be tween the English words aligned to this state times the number of state visits1.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
This penalty controls the fertility of the Arabic words.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"To determine the English words that aligned to the Arabic position,the search path is traced back for each hypothe sis and a sufficiently large beam is maintained sothat alignments in the future can correct past alignment decisions.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
This penalty allows English determiners and prepositions to align to the Arabic content word while penalizing distant words from align ing to the state.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In terms of alignment F-measureto be described below, the state visit penalty, if re moved makes the performance degrade from F=87.8 to F=84.0 compared to removing the frontier notion which only degrades performance to F=86.9.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
3.2 Observation Model.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
The observation model measures the linkage of the source and target using a set of feature functions defined on the words and their context.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In Figure 1, an event is a single link from an English word to an Arabic state and the event space is the sentence pair.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
We use the maximum entropy formulation (e.g.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"(Berger et al, 1996)), 1We are overloading the word ?state?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
to mean Arabic word position.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"f = ?(li) h = [ ti?11 , sK1 ] p(f |h) = 1Z(h) exp ? i ?i?i(h, f), where Z(h) is the normalizing constant, Z(h) = ? f exp ? i ?i?i(h, f).","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"and ?i(h, f) are binary valued feature functions.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The function ? selects the Arabic word at the position being linked or in the case of segmentation features,one of the segmentations of that position.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"We re strict the history context to select from the current English word and words to the left as well as thecurrent word?s WordNet (Miller, 1990) synset as re quired by the features defined below.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"As in (Cherryand Lin, 2003), the above functions simplify the con ditioning portion, h by utilizing only the words andcontext involved in the link li.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Training is done us ing the IIS technique (Della Pietra et al, 1995) and convergence often occurs in 3-10 iterations.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
The five types of features which are utilized in the system are described below.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Phrase to phrase (for example, idiomatic phrases)alignments are intepreted as each English word com ing from each of the Arabic words.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
3.2.1 Lexical Features The lexical features are similar to the translationmatrix of the IBM Model 1.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"However, there is a sign ficant out of vocabulary (OOV) issue in the model since training data is limited.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
All words that have a corpus frequency of 1 are left out of the model and classed into an unknown word class in order to explicitly model connecting unknown words.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"From the training data we obtain 50K lexical features, and applying the Arabic segmenter obtain another 17K lexical features of the form ?(English content word, Arabic stem).","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"3.2.2 Arabic Segmentation Features An Arabic segmenter similar to (Lee et al, 2003)provides the segmentation features.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"A small dictionary is used (with 71 rules) to restrict the set of Ara bic segments that can align to English stopwords, for example that ?the?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
aligns to ?Al#?,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"and that ?for?, ?in?and ?to?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
align to ?b#?,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
and ?her?,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
aligns with the suffix ?+hA?.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Segmentation features also help align un known words, as stems might be seen in the training corpus with other prefixes or suffixes.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Additionally, the ability to align the prefix and suffix accurately,tends to ?drag?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
the unknown stem to its English tar get.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
91 3.2.3 WordNet Features WordNet features provide normalization on the English words.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The feature is instantiated for nouns,adjectives, adverbs and verbs following their definitions in WordNet.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"If the Arabic word has a seg mentation then the feature is ?(WordNet synset id, Arabic stem), otherwise it is ?(WordNet synset id,Arabic word).","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
The feature ties together English syn onyms and helps improve recall of the aligner.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"3.2.4 Spelling Feature The spelling feature is applied only on unknownwords and is used to measure the string kernel dis tance(Lodhi et al, 2000) between romanized Arabicand English words.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
The feature is designed primar ily to link unknown names.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, ?Clinton?is written as ?klyntwn?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
in one of its romanized Arabic versions.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In a sentence, measuring the string ker nel distance shows a correlation between these names even though there is not much overlap between thecharacters.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The feature has four possible values: no match, somematch, goodmatch, and exact.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
3.2.5 Dynamic Features Dynamic features are defined on the lattice of thesearch algorithm.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
These features fire when the pre vious source and target word pair are linked.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, one such feature is ?b# in?","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"and if on the hypothesis we have just linked this pair and the nextEnglish word is being aligned to the stem of the Ara bic word where this prefix occurs, this feature fires and boosts the probability that the next words are aligned.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The basic intuition behind this feature is that words inside prepositional phrases tend to align, which is similar to the dependency structure feature of (Cherry and Lin, 2003).At training time, the lattice reduces to the single path provided by the annotation.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Since this fea ture tends to suffer from the drag of function words, we insist that the next words that are being linked have at least one feature that applies.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"All word pairslinked in the training data have lexical features as de scribed above, and if both source and target words are unknown they have a single feature for their link.","{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
Applying dynamic features on words that have atleast one other feature prevents words which are completely unrelated from being linked because of a fea ture about the context of the words.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
Two types of dynamic features are distinguished: (a) English word with Arabic prefix/suffix and (b) English word with Arabic stem.,"{'title': 'Algorithm. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Since the annotated training data for word alignmentis limited and a much larger parallel corpus is avail able for other aligners, we smooth the observation Anno.","{'title': 'Smoothing the Observation Model. ', 'number': '4'}"

A beam search algorithm is utilized with the English words consumed in sequence and the Arabic word positions serving as states in the search process.,"{'title': 'Search Algorithm. ', 'number': '5'}"
"Inorder to take advantage of the transition model de scribed above, a large beam must be maintained.","{'title': 'Search Algorithm. ', 'number': '5'}"
"To see this, note that English words often repeat in a sentence and the models will tend to link the wordto all Arabic positions which have the same Ara bic content.","{'title': 'Search Algorithm. ', 'number': '5'}"
"In traditional algorithms, the Markov assumption is made and hypothesis are merged if they have the same history in the previous time step.","{'title': 'Search Algorithm. ', 'number': '5'}"
"However, here we maintain all hypotheses and merge only if the paths are same for 30 words which is the average sentence length.","{'title': 'Search Algorithm. ', 'number': '5'}"
"We have word aligned a portion of the Arabic Tree bank (4300 sentences) and material from the LDC news sources (LDC, 2005) to obtain a total of 10.3K sentence pairs for training.","{'title': 'Experimental Data. ', 'number': '6'}"

6.1 Annotator Agreement.,"{'title': 'Experimental Data. ', 'number': '6'}"
We measure intra/inter-annotator agreement on thetest set in order to determine the feasibility of hu man annotation of word links.,"{'title': 'Experimental Data. ', 'number': '6'}"

The results indicate that lexical featuresare the most important type of feature; segmenta tion features further reduce the AER by 15.8%.,"{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '7'}"
