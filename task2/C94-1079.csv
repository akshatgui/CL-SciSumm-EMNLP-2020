"We present an efI\]cient, broad-coverage, principle-based parser for English.",Introduction
The parser has been implemented in C++ and runs on SUN Sparcstations with X-windows.,Introduction
"It con- rains a lexicon with over 90,000 entries, con- structed automatically b applying a set of ex- traction and conversion rules to entries from machine readable dictionaries.",Introduction
"Principle-based grammars, such as Govern- ment-Binding (GB) theory (Chomsky, 1981; Haegeman, 1991), offer many advantages over rule-based and unification-based grammars, such as the universality ofprinciples and mod- ularity of components in the grammar.",Results/Conclusion
Prin- ciples are constraints over X-bar structures.,Results/Conclusion
"Most previous principle-based parsers, e.g., (Dorr, 1991; Font, 1991; Johnson, 1991), es- sentially generate all possible X-bar structures of a sentence and then use the principles to fil- ter out the illicit ones.",Results/Conclusion
The drawback of this approach is the inefficiency due 1;o the large number of candidate structures to be.,Results/Conclusion
filtered out.,Results/Conclusion
"The problem persists even when w~rions techniques such as optimal ordering of princi- ples (Fong, 1991), and corontining (Dorr, 1991; Johnson, 1991) are used.",Results/Conclusion
This problem may also account for the fact that these parsers are experimental nd have limited coverage.,Results/Conclusion
"This paper describes an efficient, broad- coverage, principle-based parser, called PRIN- CIPAR.",Results/Conclusion
The main innovation in PRINCIPAR is that it applies principles to descriptions o17 X- bar structures rather than the structures them- selves.,Results/Conclusion
X-bar structures of a sentence are only built when their descriptions have satisfied all the pri ncil)les.,Results/Conclusion

Sentence analysis is divided into three steps.,Results/Conclusion
The lexical analyser first converts the in- put sentence into a set of texical items.,Results/Conclusion
"Then, a message passing algorithm for OB-parsing is used to construct a shared parse forest.",Results/Conclusion
"Fi- nally, a parse tree retriever is used to enumer- ate the parse trees.",Results/Conclusion
"The key idea of the parsing algorithm was presented in (tin, 199:1).",Results/Conclusion
This paper presents some implementation details and experimental results.,Results/Conclusion
"The parser in PIHNCIPAR is based on a message-passing framework proposed by \],in (1993) and l,in and Ooebel (1993), which uses a network to encode the grammar.",Results/Conclusion
"The nodes in tile grammar network represent grammati- cal categories (e.g., NP, Nbar, N) or subcate- gories, such as V:NP (transitive verbs that take NPs as complements).",Results/Conclusion
The links in the net- work re.present relationships bel;ween the cat- egories.,Results/Conclusion

The input sentence is parsed in the follow- ing steps.,Results/Conclusion
Step 1: Lex iea l Look-up : Retrieve the lex- ical entries for all the words in the sentence and create a lexical item for each word sense.,Results/Conclusion
"A lexical item is a triple: <\[i,j\], av~lf, av ..... p>, where \[i,j\] is an interval denoting the position of the word in the sentence; av~lf is the at- tribute values of the word sense; and av,:o,,,, is the attr ibute values of the complements of the word sense.",Results/Conclusion
"Step 2: Message Passing: For each lexi- eel item <\[i,j\], av~lf, av ..... p>, create an initiM message <\[i,j\], av~r, 0> and send this message to the grammar network node that represents the category or subcategory of the word sense.",Results/Conclusion
"When the node receives the initial message, it may forward the message to other nodes or it ma,y combine the message with other messages and send the resulting combination to other nodes.",Results/Conclusion
This initiates a message passing pro- cess which stops when there are no more mes- sages to be passed around.,Results/Conclusion
"At that point, the initial message for the next lexical item is fed into the network.",Results/Conclusion
"Step 3: Build a Shared Parse Forest When all lexieal items have been processed, a shared parse forest for the input sentence can be built by tracing the origins of the messages at the highest node (CP or IP), whose str com- ponent is the whole sentence.",Results/Conclusion
The parse forest consists of the links of the grammar network that are traversed uring the tracing process.,Results/Conclusion
"The structure of the parse forest is similar to (Billot and Long, 1989) and (Tomita, 1986), but extended to include attribute values.",Results/Conclusion
The parse trees of the input sentence can be retrieved h'om the parse forest one by one.,Results/Conclusion
The next section explains how tile constraints attached to the nodes and links in the network ensure that the parse trees satisfy all the prin- ciples.,Results/Conclusion
GB principles are implemented as local and percolation constraints on the items.,Results/Conclusion
Lo- cal constraints are attached to nodes in the network.,Results/Conclusion
"All items at a node must satisfy the node's local constraint, l?ercolation con- straints are attached to the links in the net- work.",Results/Conclusion
A message can be sent across a link only if the item satisfies the percolation constraint of the link.,Results/Conclusion
"We will only use two examples to give the reader a general idea about how GB principles are interpreted as loc, al and percolation con- straints.",Results/Conclusion
Interested reader is referred to Lin (1993) for more details.,Results/Conclusion
3.1.,Results/Conclusion
Bound ing rpheory.,Results/Conclusion
The Bounding Theory (Subjaneency) states that a movement can cross at most one bar- rier without leaving an intermedia~te trace.,Results/Conclusion
An attribute named ~hbarr?0r is used to imple- ment this l)rinciple.,Results/Conclusion
"A message containing the attribute value -whbarrier iS used to rep- resent an X-bar structure contMnlng a posi- tion out ol7 which a wh-constituent has moved, but without yet crossing a barrier.",Results/Conclusion
The wdue +whbarrier means that the movement has M- ready crossed one barrier.,Results/Conclusion
Certain dominance links in the network are designated as bar- rier links.,Results/Conclusion
"Bounding condition is implemented by tile percolation constraints attached to the barrier links, which block any message with +whbarrier and change -whbarrior to +whbarrier before the message is allowed to pass through.",Results/Conclusion

The -cm al;tril)ute then propagates with tile item as it is sent to el;her nodes.,Results/Conclusion

Lex icon.,Results/Conclusion
The lexicon in PRINCIPAl{ consists of two hash tables: a primary one in memory and a secondary one on disk.,Results/Conclusion
"Tile secondary hash ta.= ble contains over 90,000 entries, most of which are constructed automatically by applying a set of extraction and conw:rsion rules to etP tries in Oxford Adwmced \],eaner's l)ictionary and Collins English I)ictionary.",Results/Conclusion
"When a word is looked up, t;he F, rimary hashtable is searched first.",Results/Conclusion
"If a,n entry for the word is found, the lexical search is done.",Results/Conclusion
"Oth- erwise, the secondary hash table is searched.",Results/Conclusion
"The entry retrieved from the secondary LaI)Ie is inserted into the primary one, so, tha,t when the word is encouutered again only in-memory search will be necessary.",Results/Conclusion
"The primary hash table is lc, aded from a file a.L l;he system start-up.",Results/Conclusion
The file also serves as a buffer for changes to the secondary hash tM)le.,Results/Conclusion
"When a lexical entry is ad(led or \]nc, dified, it is saved in the file for the prhnary hash table.",Results/Conclusion
The entry in the se<:(mdary hash tal)le remains unchanged.,Results/Conclusion
"Since the i)rimary hash tM)le is a lw~ws consulted first, its entrios override the (;orresponditlg entries in the seco\[ldary La})\]C. The reason why the buffer in needed is that the secondary hash table is designed ill such a way that update speed is sacrificed for the sake of ef\[icie.t retriewd.",Results/Conclusion
"Therefore, updates to the secondary hash tal)le should I>e done in batch and relatively infrequently.",Results/Conclusion
The tw(>tier organization of the lexicon is transparent to the l)arser.,Results/Conclusion
"That is, as far as the.",Results/Conclusion
"parser is concerned, the lexic<m is an o1> jec{, that, given a word or a phrase, returns its lexical entry or ni l if the entry (lees not exist in the lexicon.",Results/Conclusion

"The first argt l tne I l ( ; of t}te function is the attrHmte va,lues of the word 485 itself.",Results/Conclusion
The second argument of the function is a list of attribute value vector for the comple- ments of the word.,Results/Conclusion
"For example, the above en- try means that acknowl edge is a verb that takes an IP, NP or CP as the complement.",Results/Conclusion
The lex- icon is extensible in that users can define new functions to suit their own needs.,Results/Conclusion
"Current im- plementation of the lexicon also includes func- tions ref and phrase, which are explained in the next two subsections.",Results/Conclusion
4.2.,Results/Conclusion
Reference Entr ies.,Results/Conclusion
The lexicon does not contain separate ntries for regular variations of words.,Results/Conclusion
"When a word is not found in the lexicon, the lexleal retriever strips the endings of the word to recow~'r pos- sible base forms of the word and look them up in the lexicon.",Results/Conclusion
"For example, when the lc'xieal retriever fails to find an entry for ""studies,"" it searches the lexicon for ""studie,"" ""studi"" and ""study.""",Results/Conclusion
Only the last one of these has an en- try in the lexicon and its entry is returned.,Results/Conclusion
Irregular variations of words are explicitly listed in the lexicon.,Results/Conclusion
"For example, there is an entry for the word ""began.""",Results/Conclusion
"IIowever, the snb- catgorization frames of ""begin"" are not listed again under ""began.""",Results/Conclusion
"Instead, the entry con- tains a ref fimction which returns a reference to the entry for ""begin.""",Results/Conclusion
"(began (ref ((cat v) (vform ed) -prog-perf-passive (tense past))) (begin (cat)))) The first argument of ref is the attribute val- ues of ""began.""",Results/Conclusion
The second argument contains the base form of the word and a set of at- tribute names.,Results/Conclusion
"The lexical items for the word ""began"" is obtained by unifying its attribute values with the attribute wdues in the lexiea\] entry for ""begin.""",Results/Conclusion
"The advantage of making references to the base form is that when the base form is modified, one does not have to make changes to the entries for its variations.",Results/Conclusion
4.a. Phrasal Entr ies \]'he lexicon also allows for phrases that consist of multiple words.,Results/Conclusion
One of the words in a phrase is designated as the head word.,Results/Conclusion
The head word should be a word in the phrase that can un- dergo morphological changes and is the most in frequent.,Results/Conclusion
"For example, in the phrase, ""down payment,"" the head word is ""payment.""",Results/Conclusion
"In d~e lexicon, a phrase ""wl . . .",Results/Conclusion
wj . . .,Results/Conclusion
"w,,/' is stored as a s t r ing ""'Wh . . .",Results/Conclusion
"'tOn, 101 . . .",Results/Conclusion
"'U,~h_l.""",Results/Conclusion
"That is, the first word in the string is always head word and the words Mter "","" should ap- pear before the head word in texts.",Results/Conclusion
"The rune- don phrases converts il, s arguments into a list of phrases where tile entry word is the head.",Results/Conclusion
"l,'or example, the lexical entry for ""paymenC' is as follows: (payment (subcat ((cat n) (nform norm))) (phrases (payment, down) (payment, stop) (payment, token) (payment, transfer))) After retrieving the entry for a word, each phrase in the phrase list is compared with the surrounding words in the sentence.",Results/Conclusion
"If the phrase is found in the sentence, the entry for the phrase is retrieved froin the lexicon.",Results/Conclusion
5.,Results/Conclusion
Reducing Ambiguities.,Results/Conclusion
One of the problems with many parsers is that they typically generate far more parses than humans normally do.,Results/Conclusion
"I""or example, the average number of parses pet' word is 1.35 in (l\]lack et al, 1992).",Results/Conclusion
"That means that their parser produces, on average, 8 parses for a 7-word sentence, 3d parses for a, l%word sentence, and ld4 l)a.rses for a 17-word seiRe.nce, rphe la.rge number of parse trees make tim l~roe(,ssing at later stages more dillicult and error l)ruTte.",Results/Conclusion
PI{INCII)AI{ defines a weight for every parse tree.,Results/Conclusion
A weight is associated with every word sense and every link in the parse tree.,Results/Conclusion
\[Pile weight of the parse tree is the total weight of the links and the word senses ~tt the leaf nodes of the tree.,Results/Conclusion
The packed shared parse forest in PtUN- CIPAI{.,Results/Conclusion
is organized in such a way that the parse tree with minimum weight is retrieved first.,Results/Conclusion
"I~IUNCIPAII, then uses the minimum weight and a predetermined number called BIGWEIGHT, which is currently arbitraryly de- fined to be 20, to prune the parse forest.",Results/Conclusion
Only 486 the parse trees whose weights are less than (minimum weiglit -F BIGWEIGHT/2) are spared and output.,Results/Conclusion
"The weights of the links and word senses are determined as follows: e 'I'he links fi'om Xbar to an ad,imlct YP have weight=nlGWEIglIW and all the~ other links have weight=l.0.",Results/Conclusion
"? The words in the lexicon ma,y have an attribute rar% which takes wdues from {very, very-very}.",Results/Conclusion
"If a word sense has the attribute value (rare very), its weight is BIGWEIGIIT.",Results/Conclusion
"I fa word sense has the attribute value (rare very-very), its weight is 2?BIGWEIGIIT.",Results/Conclusion
"Otherwise, the weight is 0, Note that the att;ribute rare is used to indicate the relative frequency among different stmses of the same word.",Results/Conclusion
"/II~ /I L bigwe!ght L ', John John V /~; NP'~/N p /~N~, about Kim read a/ ~b~r read /NP.",Results/Conclusion

"Comparing the two parses of the sentence ""John read the story a,bout Kim"" in Figure 3: in (a), lee about Kim\] is the co,n- plement of ""story""; in (b), it is the a.djunct of ""read"".",Results/Conclusion
"Since the adjunct dominance link from Vbar to PP has much higher weight than the complement dominance link from Nba.r to PP, the total weight of (a) is much smaller them the weight of (b).",Results/Conclusion
"Therefore, only (a) is output as the parse tree of the sentence.",Results/Conclusion
