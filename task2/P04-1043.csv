In this paper we have designed and experimented novel convolution kernels for automatic classification of predicate arguments.,{}
Their main property is the ability to process structured representations.,{}
"Support Vector Machines (SVMs), using a combination of such kernels and the flat feature kernel, classify Prop- Bank predicate arguments with accuracy higher the current argument classification state- Additionally, experiments on FrameNet data have shown that SVMs are appealing for the classification of semantic roles even if the proposed kernels do not produce any improvement.",{}
"Several linguistic theories, e.g.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"(Jackendoff, 1990) claim that semantic information in natural language texts is connected to syntactic structures.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Hence, to deal with natural language semantics, the learning algorithm should be able to represent and process structured data.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The classical solution adopted for such tasks is to convert syntax structures into flat feature representations which are suitable for a given learning model.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The main drawback is that structures may not be properly represented by flat features.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In particular, these problems affect the processing of predicate argument structures annotated in PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) or FrameNet (Fillmore, 1982).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Figure 1 shows an example of a predicate annotation in PropBank for the sentence: &quot;Paul gives a lecture in Rome&quot;.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A predicate may be a verb or a noun or an adjective and most of the time Arg 0 is the logical subject, Arg 1 is the logical object and ArgM may indicate locations, as in our example.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
FrameNet also describes predicate/argument structures but for this purpose it uses richer semantic structures called frames.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"These latter are schematic representations of situations involving various participants, properties and roles in which a word may be typically used.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Frame elements or semantic roles are arguments of predicates called target words.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In FrameNet, the argument names are local to a particular frame.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Several machine learning approaches for argument identification and classification have been developed (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Their common characteristic is the adoption of feature spaces that model predicate-argument structures in a flat representation.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"On the contrary, convolution kernels aim to capture structural information in term of sub-structures, providing a viable alternative to flat features.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we select portions of syntactic trees, which include predicate/argument salient sub-structures, to define convolution kernels for the task of predicate argument classification.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In particular, our kernels aim to (a) represent the relation between predicate and one of its arguments and (b) to capture the overall argument structure of the target predicate.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Additionally, we define novel kernels as combinations of the above two with the polynomial kernel of standard flat features.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Experiments on Support Vector Machines using the above kernels show an improvement of the state-of-the-art for PropBank argument classification.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 defines the Predicate Argument Extraction problem and the standard solution to solve it.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
In Section 3 we present our kernels whereas in Section 4 we show comparative results among SVMs using standard features and the proposed kernels.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Finally, Section 5 summarizes the conclusions.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Given a sentence in natural language and the target predicates, all arguments have to be recognized.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"This problem can be divided into two subtasks: (a) the detection of the argument boundaries, i.e. all its compounding words and (b) the classification of the argument type, e.g.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
Arg0 or ArgM in PropBank or Agent and Goal in FrameNet.,"{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"The standard approach to learn both detection and classification of predicate arguments is summarized by the following steps: For example, in Figure 1, for each combination of the predicate give with the nodes N, S, VP, V, NP, PP, D or IN the instances F”give”,a are generated.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"In case the node a exactly covers Paul, a lecture or in Rome, it will be a positive instance otherwise it will be a negative one, e.g.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"F”give”,”IN”.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
To learn the argument classifiers the T + set can be re-organized as positive T+argi and negative T−argi examples for each argument i.,"{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"In this way, an individual ONE-vs-ALL classifier for each argument i can be trained.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"We adopted this solution as it is simple and effective (Hacioglu et al., 2003).","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"In the classification phase, given a sentence of the test-set, all its Fp ,a are generated and classified by each individargument associated with the maximum value among the scores provided by the SVMs, i.e. argmaxiES Ci, where S is the target set of arguments.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"The discovery of relevant features is, as usual, a complex task, nevertheless, there is a common consensus on the basic features that should be adopted.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"These standard features, firstly proposed in (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002), refer to a flat information derived from parse trees, i.e.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"Phrase Type, Predicate Word, Head Word, Governing Category, Position and Voice.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
Table 1 presents the standard features and exemplifies how they are extracted from the parse tree in Figure 1.,"{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, the Parse Tree Path feature represents the path in the parse-tree between a predicate node and one of its argument nodes.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"It is expressed as a sequence of nonterminal labels linked by direction symbols (up or down), e.g. in Figure 1, VTVPINP is the path between the predicate to give and the argument 1, a lecture.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"Two pairs <p1, a1> and <p2, a2> have two different Path features even if the paths differ only for a node in the parse-tree.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
This prevents the learning algorithm to generalize well on unseen data.,"{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to address this problem, the next section describes a novel kernel space for predicate argument classification.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"Given a vector space in Rn and a set of positive and negative points, SVMs classify vectors according to a separating hyperplane, H(x) = w�x x�+ b = 0, where w� E Rn and b E Rare learned by applying the Structural Risk Minimization principle (Vapnik, 1995).","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"To apply the SVM algorithm to Predicate Argument Classification, we need a function O :F — Rn to map our features space F = {f1, .., f|F|} and our predicate/argument pair representation,( Fp ,a =(( Fz, into Rn, such that: Fz — O(Fz) = (01(Fz), .., On(Fz)) From the kernel theory we have that: where, Fi Vi E {1, .., l} are the training instances and the product K(Fi, Fz) =<O(Fi) · O(Fz)> is the kernel function associated with the mapping O.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"The simplest mapping that we can apply is O(Fz) = z� = (z1,..., zn) where zi = 1 if fi E Fz otherwise zi = 0, i.e. the characteristic vector of the set Fz with respect to F. If we choose as a kernel function the scalar product we obtain the linear kernel KL(Fx, Fz) = x�· z.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
"Another function which is the current stateof-the-art of predicate argument classification is the polynomial kernel: Kp(Fx, Fz) = (c+x·z-)d, where c is a constant and d is the degree of the polynom.","{'title': '2 Predicate Argument Extraction: a standard approach', 'number': '2'}"
We propose two different convolution kernels associated with two different predicate argument sub-structures: the first includes the target predicate with one of its arguments.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
We will show that it contains almost all the standard feature information.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
The second relates to the sub-categorization frame of verbs.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"In this case, the kernel function aims to cluster together verbal predicates which have the same syntactic realizations.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
This provides the classification algorithm with important clues about the possible set of arguments suited for the target syntactic structure.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
(PAF) We consider the predicate argument structures annotated in PropBank or FrameNet as our semantic space.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
The smallest sub-structure which includes one predicate with only one of its arguments defines our structural feature.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, Figure 2 illustrates the parse-tree of the sentence &quot;Paul delivers a talk in formal style&quot;.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"The circled substructures in (a), (b) and (c) are our semantic objects associated with the three arguments of the verb to deliver, i.e.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"<deliver, Arg0>, <deliver, Arg1 > and <deliver, ArgM>.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that each predicate/argument pair is associated with only one structure, i.e.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Fp,a contain only one of the circled sub-trees.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
Other important properties are the followings: (1) The overall semantic feature space F contains sub-structures composed of syntactic information embodied by parse-tree dependencies and semantic information under the form of predicate/argument annotation.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"1Fp,a was defined as the set of features of the object <p, a>.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Since in our representations we have only one An example of features in Y is given in Figure 4 where the whole set of fragments, Fdeliver,Arg1, of the argument structure Fdeliver,Arg1, is shown (see also Figure 2).","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
It is worth noting that the allowed sub-trees contain the entire (not partial) production rules.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For instance, the sub-tree [NP [D a]] is excluded from the set of the Figure 4 since only a part of the production NP —* D N is used in its generation.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"However, this constraint does not apply to the production VP —* V NP PP along with the fragment [VP [V NP]] as the subtree [VP [PP [...]]] is not considered part of the semantic structure.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, in step 1, an argument structure Fp,a is mapped in a fragment set Fp,a.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"In step 2, this latter is mapped into x = (x1,..,x|F|) E R|F|, where xi is equal to the number of times that fi occurs in Fp,a2.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"In order to evaluate K((Fx), (Fz)) without evaluating the feature vector x and z we define the indicator function Ii(n) = 1 if the substructure i is rooted at node n and 0 otherwise.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"It follows that i(Fx) = nNx Ii(n), where Nx is the set of the Fx’s nodes.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, the kernel can be written as: where Nx and Nz are the nodes in Fx and Fz, respectively.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"In (Collins and Duffy, 2002), it has been shown that i Ii(nx)Ii(nz) = A(nx, nz) can be computed in O(JNxJ x INzI) by the following recursive relation: guments, cannot be included one in the other.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
This property is important because a convolution kernel would not be effective to distinguish between an object and its sub-parts.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
The above object space aims to capture all the information between a predicate and one of its arguments.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
Its main drawback is that important structural information related to interargument dependencies is neglected.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
In order to solve this problem we define the SubCategorization Feature (SCF).,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
This is the subparse tree which includes the sub-categorization frame of the target verbal predicate.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, Figure 3 shows the parse tree of the sentence &quot;He flushed the pan and buckled his belt&quot;.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"The solid line describes the SCF of the predicate flush, i.e.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Fflush whereas the dashed line tailors the SCF of the predicate buckle, i.e.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
Fbuckle.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that SCFs are features for predicates, (i.e. they describe predicates) whereas PAF characterizes predicate/argument pairs.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Once semantic representations are defined, we need to design a kernel function to estimate the similarity between our objects.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
As suggested in Section 2 we can map them into vectors in Rn and evaluate implicitly the scalar product among them.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Given the semantic objects defined in the previous section, we design a convolution kernel in a way similar to the parse-tree kernel proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
We divide our mapping  in two steps: (1) from the semantic structure space Y (i.e.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"PAF or SCF objects) to the set of all their possible sub-structures element in Fp,a with an abuse of notation we use it to indicate the objects themselves. where nc(nx) is the number of the children of nx and ch(n, i) is the i-th child of the node n. Note that as the productions are the same ch(nx, i) = ch(nz, i).","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"This kind of kernel has the drawback of assigning more weight to larger structures while the argument type does not strictly depend on the size of the argument (Moschitti and Bejan, 2004).","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"To overcome this problem we can scale the relative importance of the tree fragments using a parameter A for the cases (2) and (3), i.e.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"A(nx, nz) = A and respectively.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"It is worth noting that even if the above equations define a kernel function similar to the one proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002), the substructures on which it operates are different from the parse-tree kernel.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, Figure 4 shows that structures such as [VP [V] [NP]], [VP [V delivers ] [NP]] and [VP [V] [NP [DT] [N]]] are valid features, but these fragments (and many others) are not generated by a complete production, i.e.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
VP —* V NP PP.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
As a consequence they would not be included in the parse-tree kernel of the sentence.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"In this section we compare standard features with the kernel based representation in order to derive useful indications for their use: First, PAK estimates a similarity between two argument structures (i.e., PAF or SCF) by counting the number of sub-structures that are in common.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"As an example, the similarity between the two structures in Figure 2, F”delivers”,Arg0 and F”delivers”,Arg1, is equal to 1 since they have in common only the [V delivers] substructure.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
Such low value depends on the fact that different arguments tend to appear in different structures.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"On the contrary, if two structures differ only for a few nodes (especially terminals or near terminal nodes) the similarity remains quite high.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, if we change the tense of the verb to deliver (Figure 2) in delivered, the [VP [V delivers] [NP]] subtree will be transformed in [VP [VBD delivered] [NP]], where the NP is unchanged.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, the similarity with the previous structure will be quite high as: (1) the NP with all sub-parts will be matched and (2) the small difference will not highly affect the kernel norm and consequently the final score.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
The above property also holds for the SCF structures.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, in Figure 3, KPAK (0(Fflush), 0(Fbuckle)) is quite high as the two verbs have the same syntactic realization of their arguments.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"In general, flat features do not possess this conservative property.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the Parse Tree Path is very sensible to small changes of parse-trees, e.g. two predicates, expressed in different tenses, generate two different Path features.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, some information contained in the standard features is embedded in PAF: Phrase Type, Predicate Word and Head Word explicitly appear as structure fragments.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, in Figure 4 are shown fragments like [NP [DT] [N]] or [NP [DT a] [N talk]] which explicitly encode the Phrase Type feature NP for the Arg 1 in Figure 2.b.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
The Predicate Word is represented by the fragment [V delivers] and the Head Word is encoded in [N talk].,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
The same is not true for SCF since it does not contain information about a specific argument.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"SCF, in fact, aims to characterize the predicate with respect to the overall argument structures rather than a specific pair <p, a>.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Third, Governing Category, Position and Voice features are not explicitly contained in both PAF and SCF.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Nevertheless, SCF may allow the learning algorithm to detect the active/passive form of verbs.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Finally, from the above observations follows that the PAF representation may be used with PAK to classify arguments.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"On the contrary, SCF lacks important information, thus, alone it may be used only to classify verbs in syntactic categories.","{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
This suggests that SCF should be used in conjunction with standard features to boost their classification performance.,"{'title': '3 Convolution Kernels for Semantic Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"The aim of our experiments are twofold: On the one hand, we study if the PAF representation produces an accuracy higher than standard features.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"On the other hand, we study if SCF can be used to classify verbs according to their syntactic realization.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
Both the above aims can be carried out by combining PAF and SCF with the standard features.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
For this purpose we adopted two ways to combine kernels3: (1) K = K1 · K2 and (2) K = -yK1 + K2.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The resulting set of kernels used in the experiments is the following: tween the normalized4 PAF-based kernel and the normalized polynomial kernel.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"KSCF·Kpd |KSCF|·|Kpd|, i.e. the normalized product between SCF-based kernel and the polynomial kernel.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"The above kernels were experimented over two corpora: PropBank (www.cis.upenn.edu/ace) along with Penn TreeBank5 2 (Marcus et al., 1993) and FrameNet.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"PropBank contains about 53,700 sentences and a fixed split between training and testing which has been used in other researches e.g., (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003).","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"For the FrameNet corpus (www.icsi.berkeley .edu/framenet) we extracted all 24,558 sentences from the 40 frames of Senseval 3 task (www.senseval.org) for the Automatic Labeling of Semantic Roles.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
We considered 18 of the most frequent roles and we mapped together those having the same name.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
Only verbs are selected to be predicates in our evaluations.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"Additionally, 30% of training was used as a validation-set.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"The sentences were processed using Collins’ parser (Collins, 1997) to generate parse-trees automatically.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"To process PAF and SCF, we implemented our own kernels and we used them inside SVM-light.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The classification performances were evaluated using the f1 measure7 for single arguments and the accuracy for the final multi-class classifier.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"This latter choice allows us to compare the results with previous literature works, e.g.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"(Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003).","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"For the evaluation of SVMs, we used the default regularization parameter (e.g., C = 1 for normalized kernels) and we tried a few costfactor values (i.e., j E {0.1,1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) to adjust the rate between Precision and Recall.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"The multi-class accuracies, for PropBank and FrameNet using Kpd with d = 1,.., 5, are shown in Figure 5.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"We note that (a) the highest performance is reached for d = 3, (b) for PropBank our maximal accuracy (90.5%) is substantially equal to the SVM performance (88%) obtained in (Hacioglu et al., 2003) with degree 2 and (c) the accuracy on FrameNet (85.2%) is higher than the best result obtained in literature, i.e.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"82.0% in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002).","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
This different outcome is due to a different task (we classify different roles) and a different classification algorithm.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"Moreover, we did not use the Frame information which is very important8.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
It is worth noting that the difference between linear and polynomial kernel is about 3-4 percent points for both PropBank and FrameNet.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
This remarkable difference can be easily explained by considering the meaning of standard features.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, let us restrict the classification function CArg0 to the two features Voice and Position.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"Without loss of generality we can assume: (a) Voice=1 if active and 0 if passive, and (b) Position=1 when the argument is after the predicate and 0 otherwise.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"To simplify the example, we also assume that if an argument precedes the target predicate it is a subject, otherwise it is an object9.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"It follows that a constituent is Arg0, i.e.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"CArg0 = 1, if only one feature at a time is 1, otherwise it is not an Arg0, i.e.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
CArg0 = 0.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"In other words, CArg0 = Position XOR Voice, which is the classical example of a non-linear separable function that becomes separable in a superlinear space (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000).","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"After it was established that the best kernel for standard features is Kp3, we carried out all the other experiments using it in the kernel combinations.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

Each column of the two tables refers to a different kernel defined in the previous section.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"The overall meaning is discussed in the following points: First, PAF alone has good performance, since in PropBank evaluation it outperforms the linear kernel (Kp1), 88.7% vs. 86.7% whereas in FrameNet, it shows a similar performance 79.5% vs. 82.1% (compare tables with Figure 5).","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
This suggests that PAF generates the same information as the standard features in a linear space.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"However, when a degree greater than 1 is used for standard features, PAF is outperformed10.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"Second, SCF improves the polynomial kernel (d = 3), i.e. the current state-of-the-art, of about 3 percent points on PropBank (column SCF·P).","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
This suggests that (a) PAK can measure the similarity between two SCF structures and (b) the sub-categorization information provides effective clues about the expected argument type.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The interesting consequence is that SCF together with PAK seems suitable to automatically cluster different verbs that have the same syntactic realization.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"We note also that to fully exploit the SCF information it is necessary to use a kernel product (K1 · K2) combination rather than the sum (K1 + K2), e.g. column SCF+P.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"Finally, the FrameNet results are completely different.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
No kernel combinations with both PAF and SCF produce an improvement.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"On 10Unfortunately the use of a polynomial kernel on top the tree fragments to generate the XOR functions seems not successful. the contrary, the performance decreases, suggesting that the classifier is confused by this syntactic information.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"The main reason for the different outcomes is that PropBank arguments are different from semantic roles as they are an intermediate level between syntax and semantic, i.e. they are nearer to grammatical functions.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"In fact, in PropBank arguments are annotated consistently with syntactic alternations (see the Annotation guidelines for PropBank at www.cis.upenn.edu/ace).","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
On the contrary FrameNet roles represent the final semantic product and they are assigned according to semantic considerations rather than syntactic aspects.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, Cause and Agent semantic roles have identical syntactic realizations.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
This prevents SCF to distinguish between them.,"{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"Another minor reason may be the use of automatic parse-trees to extract PAF and SCF, even if preliminary experiments on automatic semantic shallow parsing of PropBank have shown no important differences versus semantic parsing which adopts Gold Standard parse-trees.","{'title': '4 The Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"In this paper, we have experimented with SVMs using the two novel convolution kernels PAF and SCF which are designed for the semantic structures derived from PropBank and FrameNet corpora.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"Moreover, we have combined them with the polynomial kernel of standard features.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"The results have shown that: First, SVMs using the above kernels are appealing for semantically parsing both corpora.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"Second, PAF and SCF can be used to improve automatic classification of PropBank arguments as they provide clues about the predicate argument structure of the target verb.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, SCF improves (a) the classification state-of-theart (i.e. the polynomial kernel) of about 3 percent points and (b) the best literature result of about 5 percent points.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"Third, additional work is needed to design kernels suitable to learn the deep semantic contained in FrameNet as it seems not sensible to both PAF and SCF information.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"Finally, an analysis of SVMs using polynomial kernels over standard features has explained why they largely outperform linear classifiers based-on standard features.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"In the future we plan to design other structures and combine them with SCF, PAF and standard features.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
In this vision the learning will be carried out on a set of structural features instead of a set of flat features.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
Other studies may relate to the use of SCF to generate verb clusters.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
