"One existing method that is based on sub-word information, Zhang et al. (2006), combines a CRF and a rule-based model.","{'title': '5 Comparison with Previous Work', 'number': '4'}"
"Unlike the character-tagging models, the CRF submodel assigns tags to subwords, which include single-character words and the most frequent multiple-character words from the training corpus.","{'title': '5 Comparison with Previous Work', 'number': '4'}"

"Reducing the agenda size increases the decoding speed, but it could cause loss of accuracy by eliminating potentially good candidates.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The agenda size also affects the training time, and resulting model, since the perceptron training algorithm uses the decoder output to adjust the model parameters.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

Accuracy does not increase beyond B = 16.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Moreover, the accuracy is quite competitive even with B as low as 4.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"This reflects the fact that the best segmentation is often within the current top few candidates in the agenda.2 Since the training and testing time generally increases as N increases, the agenda size is fixed to 16 for the remaining experiments.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
