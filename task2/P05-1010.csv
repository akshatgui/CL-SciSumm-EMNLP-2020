"To see the degree of dependency of trained models on initializations, four instances of the same model were trained with different initial values of parameters.3 The model used in this experiment was created by CENTER-PARENT binarization and was set to 16.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
Table 1 lists training/heldout data loglikelihood per sentence (LL) for the four instances and their parsing performances on the test set (section 22).,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

Different initial values were shown to affect the results of training to some extent (Table 1).,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
We compared four types of binarization.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The original form is depicted in Figure 5 and the results are shown in Figure 6.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

The parsing performances were measured using F scores of the parse trees that were obtained by re-ranking of 1000-best parses by a PCFG.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"Taking into account the dependency on initial values at the level shown in the previous experiment, we cannot say that any single model is superior to the other models when the sizes of the models are large enough.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The results shown in Figure 7 suggest that we could further improve parsing performance by increasing the model size.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"However, both the memory size and the training time are more than linear in , and the training time for the largest ( ) models was about 15 hours for the models created using CENTER-PARENT, CENTER-HEAD, and LEFT and about 20 hours for the model created using RIGHT.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"To deal with larger (e.g., = 32 or 64) models, we therefore need to use a model search that reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the model’s performance, and an approximation during training to reduce the training time.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The relationships between the average parse time and parsing performance using the three parsing methods described in Section 3 are shown in Figure 8.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"The third method outperforms the other two methods unless the parse time is very limited (i.e., 1 sec is required), as shown in the figure.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The superiority of the third method over the first method seems to stem from the difference in the number of candidate parses from which the outputs are selected.5 The superiority of the third method over the second method is a natural consequence of the consistent use of both in the estimation (as the objective function) and in the parsing (as the score of a parse).,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
