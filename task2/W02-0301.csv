"Since it is practically impossible for a researcher to grasp all of the huge amount of knowledge provided in the form of natural language, e.g., journal papers, there is a strong demand for biomedical information extraction (IE), which extracts knowledge automatically from biomedical papers using NLP techniques (Ohta et al., 1997; Proux et al., 2000; Yakushiji et al., 2001).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

We modify this representation in Section 5.1 in order to accelerate the SVM training.,"{'title': '3 Named Entity Recognition Using SVMs', 'number': '3'}"

The SVM constructs a binary classifier that outputs +1 or −1 given a sample vector x E Rn.,"{'title': '3 Named Entity Recognition Using SVMs', 'number': '3'}"

Margin is defined as the distance between the hyperplane and the training samples nearest to the hyperplane.,"{'title': '3 Named Entity Recognition Using SVMs', 'number': '3'}"
Maximizing the margin insists that these nearest samples (support vectors) exist on both sides of the separating hyperplane and the hyperplane lies exactly at the midpoint of these support vectors.,"{'title': '3 Named Entity Recognition Using SVMs', 'number': '3'}"

"In this set of experiments, we compare our SVM-based system with a named entity recognition system based on the Maximum Entropy method.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For the SVM system, we used the feature set {hw, pre, suf, pos, hmmi[−3,··· ,3], lwc3, rwc3, pc[−2,−1]}, which is shown to be the best in the previous experiment.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The compared system is a maximum entropy tagging model described in (Kazama et al., 2001).","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Though it supports several character type features such as number and hyphen and some conjunctive features such as word n-gram, we do not use these features to compare the performance under as close a condition as possible.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The feature set used in the maximum entropy system is expressed as {hw,pre,suf,pos,hmmi[−2,···,2], pc[−2,−1]}.10 Both systems use the BIO representation with splitting.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
Table 4 shows the accuracies of both systems.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For the SVM system, we show the results with the inner product kernel and several polynomial kernels.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The row “All (id)” shows the accuracy from the view10When the width becomes [−3,··· , 3], the accuracy degrades (53.72 to 51.73 in F-score). point of the identification task, which only finds the named entity regions.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The accuracies for several major entity classes are also shown.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The SVM system with the 2-dimensional polynomial kernel achieves the highest accuracy.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"This comparison may be unfair since a polynomial kernel has the effect of using conjunctive features, while the ME system does not use such conjunctive features.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Nevertheless, the facts: we can introduce the polynomial kernel very easily; there are very few parameters to be tuned;11 we could achieve the higher accuracy; show an advantage of the SVM system.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
It will be interesting to discuss why the SVM systems with the inner product kernel (and the polynomial kernel with d = 1) are outperformed by the ME system.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We here discuss two possible reasons.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The first is that the SVM system does not use a dynamic decision such as the Viterbi algorithm, while the ME system uses it.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"To see this, we degrade the ME system so that it predicts the classes deterministically without using the Viterbi algorithm.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We found that this system only marks 51.54 in F-score.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, it can be said that a dynamic decision is important for this named entity task.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"However, although a method to convert the outputs of a binary SVM to probabilistic values is proposed (Platt, 1999), the way to obtain meaningful probabilistic values needed in Viterbitype algorithms from the outputs of a multi-class SVM is unknown.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
Solving this problem is certainly a part of the future work.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The second possible reason is that the SVM system in this paper does not use any cut-off or feature truncation method to remove data noise, while the ME system uses a simple feature cut-off method.12 We observed that the ME system without the cut-off only marks 49.11 in 11C, s, r, and d 12Features that occur less than 10 times are removed.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
F-score.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, such a noise reduction method is also important.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"However, the cut-off method for the ME method cannot be applied without modification since, as described in Section 3.4, the definition of the features are different in the two approaches.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
It can be said the features in the ME method is “finer” than those in SVMs.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In this sense, the ME method allows us more flexible feature selection.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
This is an advantage of the ME method.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The accuracies achieved by both systems can be said high compared with those of the previous methods if we consider that we have 24 named entity classes.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"However, the accuracies are not sufficient for a practical use.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Though higher accuracy will be achieved with a larger annotated corpus, we should also explore more effective features and find effective feature combination methods to exploit such a large corpus maximally.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We have described the use of Support Vector Machines for the biomedical named entity recognition task.,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
"To make the training of SVMs with the GENIA corpus practical, we proposed to split the nonentity class by using POS information.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
"In addition, we explored the new types of features, word cache and HMM states, to avoid the data sparseness problem.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
"In the experiments, we have shown that the class splitting technique not only makes training feasible but also improves the accuracy.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
We have also shown that the proposed new features also improve the accuracy and the SVM system with the polynomial kernel function outperforms the ME-based system.,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
