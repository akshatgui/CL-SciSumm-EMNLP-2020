We present experiments with a dependency parsing model defined on rich factors.,{}
Ourmodel represents dependency trees with factors that include three types of relations be tween the tokens of a dependency and theirchildren.,{}
"We extend the projective pars ing algorithm of Eisner (1996) for our case,and train models using the averaged perceptron.",{}

"In the multi lingual exercise of the CoNLL-2007 shared task (Nivre et al, 2007), our system obtains the best accuracy for English, and the second best accuracies for Basque and Czech.",{}
