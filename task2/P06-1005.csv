We present an approach to pronoun resolution based on syntactic paths.,{}
"Through a simple bootstrapping procedure, we learn the likelihood of coreference between a pronoun and a candidate noun based on the path in the parse tree between the two entities.",{}
"This path information enables us to handle previously challenging resolution instances, and also robustly addresses traditional syntactic coreference constraints.",{}
Highly coreferent paths also allow mining of precise probabilistic gender/number information.,{}
We combine statistical knowledge with well known features in a Support Vector Machine pronoun resolution classifier.,{}
Significant gains in performance are observed on several datasets.,{}
Pronoun resolution is a difficult but vital part of the overall coreference resolution task.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In each of the following sentences, a pronoun resolution system must determine what the pronoun his refers to: In (1), John and his corefer.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In (2), his refers to some other, perhaps previously evoked entity.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Traditional pronoun resolution systems are not designed to distinguish between these cases.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
They lack the specific world knowledge required in the second instance – the knowledge that a person does not usually explicitly need his own support.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We collect statistical path-coreference information from a large, automatically-parsed corpus to address this limitation.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
A dependency path is defined as the sequence of dependency links between two potentially coreferent entities in a parse tree.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A path does not include the terminal entities; for example, “John needs his support” and “He needs their support” have the same syntactic path.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our algorithm determines that the dependency path linking the Noun and pronoun is very likely to connect coreferent entities for the path “Noun needs pronoun’s friend,” while it is rarely coreferent for the path “Noun needs pronoun’s support.” This likelihood can be learned by simply counting how often we see a given path in text with an initial Noun and a final pronoun that are from the same/different gender/number classes.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Cases such as “John needs her support” or “They need his support” are much more frequent in text than cases where the subject noun and pronoun terminals agree in gender/number.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"When there is agreement, the terminal nouns are likely to be coreferent.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"When they disagree, they refer to different entities.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"After a sufficient number of occurrences of agreement or disagreement, there is a strong statistical indication of whether the path is coreferent (terminal nouns tend to refer to the same entity) or non-coreferent (nouns refer to different entities).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We show that including path coreference information enables significant performance gains on three third-person pronoun resolution experiments.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We also show that coreferent paths can provide the seed information for bootstrapping other, even more important information, such as the gender/number of noun phrases.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Coreference resolution is generally conducted as a pairwise classification task, using various constraints and preferences to determine whether two expressions corefer.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Coreference is typically only allowed between nouns matching in gender and number, and not violating any intrasentential syntactic principles.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Constraints can be applied as a preprocessing step to scoring candidates based on distance, grammatical role, etc., with scores developed either manually (Lappin and Leass, 1994), or through a machine-learning algorithm (Kehler et al., 2004).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Constraints and preferences have also been applied together as decision nodes on a decision tree (Aone and Bennett, 1995).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"When previous resolution systems handle cases like (1) and (2), where no disagreement or syntactic violation occurs, coreference is therefore determined by the weighting of features or learned decisions of the resolution classifier.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Without path coreference knowledge, a resolution process would resolve the pronouns in (1) and (2) the same way.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Indeed, coreference resolution research has focused on the importance of the strategy for combining well known constraints and preferences (Mitkov, 1997; Ng and Cardie, 2002), devoting little attention to the development of new features for these difficult cases.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"The application of world knowledge to pronoun resolution has been limited to the semantic compatibility between a candidate noun and the pronoun’s context (Yang et al., 2005).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We show semantic compatibility can be effectively combined with path coreference information in our experiments below.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Our method for determining path coreference is similar to an algorithm for discovering paraphrases in text (Lin and Pantel, 2001).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"In that work, the beginning and end nodes in the paths are collected, and two paths are said to be similar (and thus likely paraphrases of each other) if they have similar terminals (i.e. the paths occur with a similar distribution).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Our work does not need to store the terminals themselves, only whether they are from the same pronoun group.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Different paths are not compared in any way; each path is individually assigned a coreference likelihood.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We define a dependency path as the sequence of nodes and dependency labels between two potentially coreferent entities in a dependency parse tree.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"We use the structure induced by the minimalist parser Minipar (Lin, 1998) on sentences from the news corpus described in Section 4.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Figure 1 gives the parse tree of (2).,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"As a short-form, we write the dependency path in this case as “Noun needs pronoun’s support.” The path itself does not include the terminal nouns “John” and “his.” Our algorithm finds the likelihood of coreference along dependency paths by counting the number of times they occur with terminals that are either likely coreferent or non-coreferent.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"In the simplest version, we count paths with terminals that are both pronouns.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"We partition pronouns into seven groups of matching gender, number, and person; for example, the first person singular group contains I, me, my, mine, and myself.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"If the two terminal pronouns are from the same group, coreference along the path is likely.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"If they are from different groups, like I and his, then they are non-coreferent.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"Let NS(p) be the number of times the two terminal pronouns of a path, p, are from the same pronoun group, and let ND(p) be the number of times they are from different groups.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"We define the coreference of p as: Our statistics indicate the example path, “Noun needs pronoun’s support,” has a low C(p) value.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
We could use this fact to prevent us from resolving “his” to “John” when “John needs his support” is presented to a pronoun resolution system.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"To mitigate data sparsity, we represent the path with the root form of the verbs and nouns.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, we use Minipar’s named-entity recognition to replace named-entity nouns by the semantic category of their named-entity, when available.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"All modifiers not on the direct path, such as adjectives, determiners and adverbs, are not considered.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
We limit the maximum path length to eight nodes.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Tables 1 and 2 give examples of coreferent and non-coreferent paths learned by our algorithm and identified in our test sets.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"Coreferent paths are defined as paths with a C(p) value (and overall number of occurrences) above a certain threshold, indicating the terminal entities are highly likely Pattern Example Noun left ... to pronoun’s wife Buffett will leave the stock to his wife.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"

Non-coreferent paths have a C(p) below a certain cutoff; the terminals are highly unlikely to corefer.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Especially note the challenge of resolving most of the examples in Table 2 without path coreference information.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Although these paths encompass some cases previously covered by Binding Theory (e.g.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"“Mary suspended her,” her cannot refer to Mary by Principle B (Haegeman, 1994)), most have no syntactic justification for non-coreference per se.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"Likewise, although Binding Theory (Principle A) could identify the reflexive pronominal relationship of Example 4 in Table 1, most cases cannot be resolved through syntax alone.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Our analysis shows that successfully handling cases that may have been handled with Binding Theory constitutes only a small portion of the total performance gain using path coreference.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"In any case, Binding Theory remains a challenge with a noisy parser.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"Consider: “Alex gave her money.” Minipar parses her as a possessive, when it is more likely an object, “Alex gave money to her.” Without a correct parse, we cannot rule out the link between her and Alex through Binding Theory.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"Our algorithm, however, learns that the path “Noun gave pronoun’s money,” is noncoreferent.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"In a sense, it corrects for parser errors by learning when coreference should be blocked, given any consistent parse of the sentence.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
We obtain path coreference for millions of paths from our parsed news corpus (Section 4).,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"While Tables 1 and 2 give test set examples, many other interesting paths are obtained.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"We learn coreference is unlikely between the nouns in “Bob married his mother,” or “Sue wrote her obituary.” The fact you don’t marry your own mother or write your own obituary is perhaps obvious, but this is the first time this kind of knowledge has been made available computationally.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"Naturally, exceptions to the coreference or non-coreference of some of these paths can be found; our patterns represent general trends only.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"And, as mentioned above, reliable path coreference is somewhat dependent on consistent parsing.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Paths connecting pronouns to pronouns are different than paths connecting both nouns and pronouns to pronouns – the case we are ultimately interested in resolving.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Consider “Company A gave its data on its website.” The pronoun-pronoun path coreference algorithm described above would learn the terminals in “Noun’s data on pronoun’s website” are often coreferent.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"But if we see the phrase “Company A gave Company B’s data on its website,” then “its” is not likely to refer to “Company B,” even though we identified this as a coreferent path!","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
We address this problem with a two-stage extraction procedure.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
We first bootstrap gender/number information using the pronounpronoun paths as described in Section 4.1.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"We then use this gender/number information to count paths where an initial noun (with probabilisticallyassigned gender/number) and following pronoun are connected by the dependency path, recording the agreement or disagreement of their gender/number category.'","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
These superior paths are then used to re-bootstrap our final gender/number information used in the evaluation (Section 6).,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
We also bootstrap paths where the nodes in the path are replaced by their grammatical category.,"{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"This allows us to learn general syntactic constraints not dependent on the surface forms of the words (including, but not limited to, the Binding Theory principles).","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
"A separate set of these noncoreferent paths is also used as a feature in our sys'As desired, this modification allows the first example to provide two instances of noun-pronoun paths with terminals from the same gender/number group, linking each “its” to the subject noun “Company A”, rather than to each other.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"

"We also tried expanding our coverage by using paths similar to paths with known path coreference (based on distributionally similar words), but this did not generally increase performance.","{'title': '3 Path Coreference', 'number': '3'}"
Our determination of path coreference can be considered a bootstrapping procedure.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Furthermore, the coreferent paths themselves can serve as the seed for bootstrapping additional coreference information.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"In this section, we sketch previous approaches to bootstrapping in coreference resolution and explain our new ideas.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Coreference bootstrapping works by assuming resolutions in unlabelled text, acquiring information from the putative resolutions, and then making inferences from the aggregate statistical data.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, we assumed two pronouns from the same pronoun group were coreferent, and deduced path coreference from the accumulated counts.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
The potential of the bootstrapping approach can best be appreciated by imagining millions of documents with coreference annotations.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"With such a set, we could extract fine-grained features, perhaps tied to individual words or paths.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, we could estimate the likelihood each noun belongs to a particular gender/number class by the proportion of times this noun was labelled as the antecedent for a pronoun of this particular gender/number.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Since no such corpus exists, researchers have used coarser features learned from smaller sets through supervised learning (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002), manually-defined coreference patterns to mine specific kinds of data (Bean and Riloff, 2004; Bergsma, 2005), or accepted the noise inherent in unsupervised schemes (Ge et al., 1998; Cherry and Bergsma, 2005).","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
We address the drawbacks of these approaches by using coreferent paths as the assumed resolutions in the bootstrapping.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Because we can vary the threshold for defining a coreferent path, we can trade-off coverage for precision.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
We now outline two potential uses of bootstrapping with coreferent paths: learning gender/number information (Section 4.1) and augmenting a semantic compatibility model (Section 4.2).,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
We bootstrap this data on our automatically-parsed news corpus.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
The corpus comprises 85 GB of news articles taken from the world wide web over a 1-year period.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Bergsma (2005) learns noun gender (and number) from two principal sources: 1) mining it from manually-defined lexico-syntactic patterns in parsed corpora, and 2) acquiring it on the fly by counting the number of pages returned for various gender-indicating patterns by the Google search engine.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"The web-based approach outperformed the corpus-based approach, while a system that combined the two sets of information resulted in the highest performance (Table 3).","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
The combined gender-classifying system is a machine-learned classifier with 20 features.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
The time delay of using an Internet search engine within a large-scale anaphora resolution effort is currently impractical.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Thus we attempted to duplicate Bergsma’s corpus-based extraction of gender and number, where the information can be stored in advance in a table, but using a much larger data set.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
Bergsma ran his extraction on roughly 6 GB of text; we used roughly 85 GB.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Using the test set from Bergsma (2005), we were only able to boost performance from an FScore of 85.4% to one of 88.0% (Table 3).","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
This result led us to re-examine the high performance of Bergsma’s web-based approach.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
We realized that the corpus-based and web-based approaches are not exactly symmetric.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"The corpus-based approaches, for example, would not pick out gender from a pattern such as “John and his friends...” because “Noun and pronoun’s NP” is not one of the manually-defined gender extraction patterns.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"The web-based approach, however, would catch this instance with the “John * his/her/its/their” template, where “*” is the Google wild-card operator.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Clearly, there are patterns useful for capturing gender and number information beyond the predefined set used in the corpus-based extraction.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
We thus decided to capture gender/number information from coreferent paths.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"If a noun is connected to a pronoun of a particular gender along a coreferent path, we count this as an instance of that noun being that gender.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"In the end, the probability that the noun is a particular gender is the proportion of times it was connected to a pronoun of that gender along a coreferent path.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"
"Gender information becomes a single intuitive, accessible feature (i.e. the probability of the noun being that gender) rather than Bergsma’s 20-dimensional feature vector requiring search-engine queries to instantiate.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"

Researchers since Dagan and Itai (1990) have variously argued for and against the utility of collocation statistics between nouns and parents for improving the performance of pronoun resolution.,"{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"

"Consider the phrase, “Saddam’s wife got a Jordanian lawyer for her husband.” It is unlikely we would see “wife’s husband” in text; in other words, we would not know that husband:gen:wife is, in fact, semantically compatible and thereby we would discourage selection of “wife” as the antecedent at resolution time.","{'title': '4 Bootstrapping in Pronoun Resolution', 'number': '4'}"

"Our training set is the anaphora-annotated portion of the American National Corpus (ANC) used in Bergsma (2005), containing 1270 anaphoric pronouns4.","{'title': '5 Experimental Design', 'number': '5'}"
"We test on the ANC Test set (1291 instances) also used in Bergsma (2005) (highest resolution accuracy reported: 73.3%), the anaphoralabelled portion of AQUAINT used in Cherry and Bergsma (2005) (1078 instances, highest accuracy: 71.4%), and the anaphoric pronoun subset of the MUC7 (1997) coreference evaluation formal test set (169 instances, highest precision of 62.1 reported on all pronouns in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)).","{'title': '5 Experimental Design', 'number': '5'}"
These particular corpora were chosen so we could test our approach using the same data as comparable machine-learned systems exploiting probabilistic information sources.,"{'title': '5 Experimental Design', 'number': '5'}"
Parameters were set using cross-validation on the training set; test sets were used only once to obtain the final performance values.,"{'title': '5 Experimental Design', 'number': '5'}"
"Evaluation Metric: We report results in terms of accuracy: Of all the anaphoric pronouns in the test set, the proportion we resolve correctly.","{'title': '5 Experimental Design', 'number': '5'}"

We include the score from picking the noun immediately preceding the pronoun (after our hard filters are applied).,"{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"Due to the hard filters and limited search window, it is not possible for our system to resolve every noun to a correct antecedent.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
We thus provide the performance upper bound (i.e. the proportion of cases with a correct answer in the filtered candidate list).,"{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"On ANC and AQT, each of the probabilistic features results in a statistically significant gain in performance over a model trained and tested with that feature absent.5 On the smaller MUC set, none of the differences in 3-6 are statistically significant, however, the relative contribution of the various features remains reassuringly constant.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"Aside from missing antecedents due to the hard filters, the main sources of error include inaccurate statistical data and a classifier bias toward preceding pronouns of the same gender/number.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
It would be interesting to see whether performance could be improved by adding WordNet and web-mined features.,"{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"

Gender is our most powerful probabilistic feature.,"{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"In fact, inspecting our system’s decisions, gender often rules out coreference regardless of path coreference.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"This is not surprising, since we based the acquisition of C(p) on gender.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"That is, our bootstrapping assumption was that the majority of times these paths occur, gender indicates coreference or lack thereof.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"

Our pronoun resolution system is part of a larger information retrieval project where resolution accuracy is not necessarily the most pertinent measure of classifier performance.,"{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"More than one candidate can be useful in ambiguous cases, and not every resolution need be used.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"Since the SVM ranks antecedent candidates, we can test this ranking by selecting more than the top candidate (Topn) and evaluating coverage of the true antecedents.","{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
We can also resolve only those instances where the most likely candidate is above a certain distance from the SVM threshold.,"{'title': '6 Results and Discussion', 'number': '6'}"

"We have introduced a novel feature for pronoun resolution called path coreference, and demonstrated its significant contribution to a state-of-theart pronoun resolution system.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
This feature aids coreference decisions in many situations not handled by traditional coreference systems.,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"Also, by bootstrapping with the coreferent paths, we are able to build the most complete and accurate table of probabilistic gender information yet available.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"Preliminary experiments show path coreference bootstrapping can also provide a means of identifying pleonastic pronouns, where pleonastic neutral pronouns are often followed in a dependency path by a terminal noun of different gender, and cataphoric constructions, where the pronouns are often followed by nouns of matching gender.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
