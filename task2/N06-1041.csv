"In supervised learning, model behavior is primarily determined by labeled examples, whose production requires a certain kind of expertise and, typically, a substantial commitment of resources.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In unsupervised learning, model behavior is largely determined by the structure of the model.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Designing models to exhibit a certain target behavior requires another, rare kind of expertise and effort.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Unsupervised learning, while minimizing the usage of labeled data, does not necessarily minimize total effort.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We therefore consider here how to learn models with the least effort.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In particular, we argue for a certain kind of semi-supervised learning, which we call prototype-driven learning.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In prototype-driven learning, we specify prototypical examples for each target label or label configuration, but do not necessarily label any documents or sentences.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, when learning a model for Penn treebank-style part-of-speech tagging in English, we may list the 45 target tags and a few examples of each tag (see figure 4 for a concrete prototype list for this task).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This manner of specifying prior knowledge about the task has several advantages.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"First, is it certainly compact (though it remains to be proven that it is effective).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Second, it is more or less the minimum one would have to provide to a human annotator in order to specify a new annotation task and policy (compare, for example, with the list in figure 2, which suggests an entirely different task).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Indeed, prototype lists have been used pedagogically to summarize tagsets to students (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Finally, natural language does exhibit proform and prototype effects (Radford, 1988), which suggests that learning by analogy to prototypes may be effective for language tasks.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we consider three sequence modeling tasks: part-of-speech tagging in English and Chinese and a classified ads information extraction task.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Our general approach is to use distributional similarity to link any given word to similar prototypes.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, the word reported may be linked to said, which is in turn a prototype for the part-of-speech VBD.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We then encode these prototype links as features in a log-linear generative model, which is trained to fit unlabeled data (see section 4.1).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Distributional prototype features provide substantial error rate reductions on all three tasks.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, on English part-of-speech tagging with three prototypes per tag, adding prototype features to the baseline raises per-position accuracy from 41.3% to 80.5%.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

One approach to unsupervised learning of partof-speech models is to induce HMMs from unlabeled data in a maximum-likelihood framework.,"{'title': '2 Tasks and Related Work: Tagging', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, Merialdo (1991) presents experiments learning HMMs using EM.","{'title': '2 Tasks and Related Work: Tagging', 'number': '2'}"

"The overall approach of Grenager et al. (2005) typifies the process involved in fully unsupervised learning on new domain: they first alter the structure of their HMM so that diagonal transitions are preferred, then modify the transition structure to explicitly model boundary tokens, and so on.","{'title': '3 Tasks and Related Work: Extraction', 'number': '3'}"

"In section 5.3, we discuss an approach to this task which does not require customization of model structure, but rather centers on feature engineering.","{'title': '3 Tasks and Related Work: Extraction', 'number': '3'}"
"In the present work, we consider the problem of learning sequence models over text.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"For each document x = [xi], we would like to predict a sequence of labels y = [yi], where xi E X and yi E Y.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"We construct a generative model, p(x, y|0), where 0 are the model’s parameters, and choose parameters to maximize the log-likelihood of our observed data D: We take our model family to be chain-structured Markov random fields (MRFs), the undirected equivalent of HMMs.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Our joint probability model over (x, y) is given by where φ(c) is a potential over a clique c, taking the form exp {θT f(c)}, and f(c) is the vector of features active over c. In our sequence models, the cliques are over the edges/transitions (yi−1, yi) and nodes/emissions (xi, yi).","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
See figure 3 for an example from the English POS tagging domain.,"{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Note that the only way an MRF differs from a conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) is that the partition function is no longer observation dependent; we are modeling the joint probability of x and y instead of y given x.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"As a result, learning an MRF is slightly harder than learning a CRF; we discuss this issue in section 4.4.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"We assume prior knowledge about the target structure via a prototype list, which specifies the set of target labels Y and, for each label y E Y, a set of prototypes words, py E Py.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"See figures 2 and 4 for examples of prototype lists.1 1Note that this setting differs from the standard semisupervised learning setup, where a small number of fully labeled examples are given and used in conjunction with a larger amount of unlabeled data.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"In our prototype-driven approach, we never provide a single fully labeled example sequence.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
See section 5.3 for further comparison of this setting to semi-supervised learning.,"{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Broadly, we would like to learn sequence models which both explain the observed data and meet our prior expectations about target structure.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
A straightforward way to implement this is to constrain each prototype word to take only its given label(s) at training time.,"{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"As we show in section 5, this does not work well in practice because this constraint on the model is very sparse.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"In providing a prototype, however, we generally mean something stronger than a constraint on that word.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"In particular, we may intend that words which are in some sense similar to a prototype generally be given the same label(s) as that prototype.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"In syntactic distributional clustering, words are grouped on the basis of the vectors of their preceeding and following words (Sch¨utze, 1995; Clark, 2001).","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"The underlying linguistic idea is that replacing a word with another word of the same syntactic category should preserve syntactic well-formedness (Radford, 1988).","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"We present more details in section 5, but for now assume that a similarity function over word types is given.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Suppose further that for each non-prototype word type w, we have a subset of prototypes, Sw, which are known to be distributionally similar to w (above some threshold).","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"We would like our model to relate the tags of w to those of Sw. One approach to enforcing the distributional assumption in a sequence model is by supplementing the training objective (here, data likelihood) with a penalty term that encourages parameters for which each w’s posterior distribution over tags is compatible with it’s prototypes Sw. For example, we might maximize, where t|w is the model’s distribution of tags for word w. The disadvantage of a penalty-based approach is that it is difficult to construct the penalty term in a way which produces exactly the desired behavior.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Instead, we introduce distributional prototypes into the learning process as features in our log-linear model.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Concretely, for each prototype z, we introduce a predicate PROTO = z which becomes active at each w for which z E Sw (see figure 3).","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
One advantage of this approach is that it allows the strength of the distributional constraint to be calibrated along with any other features; it was also more successful in our experiments.,"{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
So far we have ignored the issue of how we learn model parameters θ which maximize L(θ; D).,"{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"If our model family were HMMs, we could use the EM algorithm to perform a local search.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Since we have a log-linear formulation, we instead use a gradientbased search.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"In particular, we use L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989), a standard numerical optimization technique, which requires the ability to evaluate L(θ; D) and its gradient at a given θ.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"The density p(x|θ) is easily calculated up to the global constant Z(θ) using the forward-backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989).","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"The partition function is given by sumptions about the clique potentials, but can in all cases be bounded by Where K is a suitably chosen large constant.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
We can efficiently compute ˆZ`(θ) for fixed ` using a generalization of the forward-backward algorithm to the lattice of all observations x of length ` (see Smith and Eisner (2005) for an exposition).,"{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Similar to supervised maximum entropy problems, the partial derivative of L(θ; D) with respect to each parameter θj (associated with feature fj) is given by a difference in feature expectations: The first expectation is the expected count of the feature under the model’s p(y|x, θ) and is again easily computed with the forward-backward algorithm, just as for CRFs or HMMs.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"The second expectation is the expectation of the feature under the model’s joint distribution over all x, y pairs, and is harder to calculate.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Again assuming that sentences beyond a certain length have negligible mass, we calculate the expectation of the feature for each fixed length ` and take a (truncated) weighted sum: For fixed `, we can calculate Ex,y|`,θfj using the lattice of all inputs of length `.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
The quantity p(|x |= `) is simply ˆZ`(θ)/ ˆZ(θ).,"{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"As regularization, we use a diagonal Gaussian prior with variance σ2 = 0.5, which gave relatively good performance on all tasks.","{'title': '4 Approach', 'number': '4'}"
We experimented with prototype-driven learning in three domains: English and Chinese part-of-speech tagging and classified advertisement field segmentation.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"At inference time, we used maximum posterior decoding,2 which we found to be uniformly but slightly superior to Viterbi decoding.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For our English part-of-speech tagging experiments, we used the WSJ portion of the English Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We took our data to be either the first 48K tokens (2000 sentences) or 193K tokens (8000 sentences) starting from section 2.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"We used a trigram tagger of the model form outlined in section 4.1 with the same set of spelling features reported in Smith and Eisner (2005): exact word type, character suffixes of length up to 3, initial-capital, contains-hyphen, and contains-digit.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
Our only edge features were tag trigrams.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
With just these features (our baseline BASE) the problem is symmetric in the 45 model labels.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In order to break initial symmetry we initialized our potentials to be near one, with some random noise.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"To evaluate in this setting, model labels must be mapped to target labels.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"We followed the common approach in the literature, greedily mapping each model label to a target label in order to maximize per-position accuracy on the dataset.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The results of BASE, reported in table 1, depend upon random initialization; averaging over 10 runs gave an average per-position accuracy of 41.3% on the larger training set.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We automatically extracted the prototype list by taking our data and selecting for each annotated label the top three occurring word types which were not given another label more often.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"This resulted in 116 prototypes for the 193K token setting.3 For comparison, there are 18,423 word types occurring in this data.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Incorporating the prototype list in the simplest possible way, we fixed prototype occurrences in the data to their respective annotation labels.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In this case, the model is no longer symmetric, and we no longer require random initialization or post-hoc mapping of labels.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Adding prototypes in this way gave an accuracy of 68.8% on all tokens, but only 47.7% on non-prototype occurrences, which is only a marginal improvement over BASE.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
It appears as though the prototype information is not spreading to non-prototype words.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In order to remedy this, we incorporated distributional similarity features.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Similar to (Sch¨utze, 1995), we collect for each word type a context vector of the counts of the most frequent 500 words, conjoined with a direction and distance (e.g +1,-2).","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We then performed an SVD on the matrix to obtain a reduced rank approximation.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We used the dot product between left singular vectors as a measure of distributional similarity.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For each word w, we find the set of prototype words with similarity exceeding a fixed threshold of 0.35.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For each of these prototypes z, we add a predicate PROTO = z to each occurrence of w. For example, we might add PROTO = said to each token of reported (as in figure 3).4 Each prototype word is also its own prototype (since a word has maximum similarity to itself), so when we lock the prototype to a label, we are also pushing all the words distributionally similar to that prototype towards that label.5 3To be clear: this method of constructing a prototype list required statistics from the labeled data.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"However, we believe it to be a fair and necessary approach for several reasons.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"First, we wanted our results to be repeatable.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Second, we did not want to overly tune this list, though experiments below suggest that tuning could greatly reduce the error rate.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Finally, it allowed us to run on Chinese, where the authors have no expertise.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"4Details of distributional similarity features: To extract context vectors, we used a window of size 2 in either direction and use the first 250 singular vectors.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We collected counts from all the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank as well as the entire BLIPP corpus.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We limited each word to have similarity features for its top 5 most similar prototypes.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
5Note that the presence of a prototype feature does not ensure every instance of that word type will be given its prototype’s label; pressure from “edge” features or other prototype features can cause occurrences of a word type to be given different labels.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"However, rare words with a single prototype feature are almost always given that prototype’s label.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

"For instance, both JJs and NNs tend to occur after determiners and before nouns.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The CD and DT confusion is a result of our prototype list not containing a contains-digit prototype for CD, so the predicate fails to be linked to CDs.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

"Our prototype list, however, contains information about only 116 word types and our tagger must on average choose between 16.9 tags, a much harder task.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"When Smith and Eisner (2005) include tagging dictionary entries for all words in the first half of their 24K tokens, giving tagging knowledge for 3,362 word types, they do achieve a higher accuracy of 88.1%.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

"Since we did not have access to a large auxiliary unlabeled corpus that was segmented, our distributional model was built only from the treebank text, and the distributional similarities are presumably degraded relative to the English.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

NEIGHBORHOOD and ADDRESS is another natural confusion resulting from the fact that the two fields share much of the same vocabulary (e.g [ADDRESS 2525 Telegraph Ave.] vs. [NBRHD near Telegraph]).,"{'title': 'FEATURES SIZE 11.2 FEATURES NBRHD 9.0 SIZE FEATURES 7.7 NBRHD FEATURES 6.4 ADDRESS NBRHD 5.3 UTILITIES FEATURES 5.3', 'number': '7'}"

We have shown that distributional prototype features can allow one to specify a target labeling scheme in a compact and declarative way.,"{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
These features give substantial error reduction on several induction tasks by allowing one to link words to prototypes according to distributional similarity.,"{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
Another positive property of this approach is that it tries to reconcile the success of sequence-free distributional methods in unsupervised word clustering with the success of sequence models in supervised settings: the similarity guides the learning of the sequence model.,"{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
