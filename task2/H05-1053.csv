Distributions of the senses of words are often highly skewed.,{}
This fact is exploitedby word sense disambiguation (WSD) sys tems which back off to the predominant sense of a word when contextual clues arenot strong enough.,{}
"The domain of a doc ument has a strong influence on the sensedistribution of words, but it is not feasi ble to produce large manually annotated corpora for every domain of interest.",{}
"In this paper we describe the construction of three sense annotated corpora in different domains for a sample of English words.We apply an existing method for acquiring predominant sense information automatically from raw text, and for our sam ple demonstrate that (1) acquiring suchinformation automatically from a mixeddomain corpus is more accurate than de riving it from SemCor, and (2) acquiringit automatically from text in the same do main as the target domain performs best by a large margin.",{}
"We also show that for an all words WSD task this automatic method is best focussed on words that are salient to the domain, and on words with a different acquired predominant sense in that domain compared to that acquired from a balanced corpus.",{}
"From analysis of manually sense tagged corpora, Kilgarriff (2004) has demonstrated that distributions of the senses of words are often highly skewed.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Most researchers working on word sense disambiguation(WSD) use manually sense tagged data such as SemCor (Miller et al, 1993) to train statistical classi fiers, but also use the information in SemCor on theoverall sense distribution for each word as a back off model.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In WSD, the heuristic of just choosing themost frequent sense of a word is very powerful, especially for words with highly skewed sense distri butions (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Indeed, only 5 out of the 26 systems in the recent SENSEVAL-3 English all words task (Snyder and Palmer, 2004)outperformed the heuristic of choosing the most fre quent sense as derived from SemCor (which wouldgive 61.5% precision and recall1).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

Magnini et al(2002) have shown that information about the do main of a document is very useful for WSD.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This isbecause many concepts are specific to particular domains, and for many words their most likely mean ing in context is strongly correlated to the domain of the document they appear in.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Thus, since word sense distributions are skewed and depend on the domain at hand we would like to know for each domain of application the most likely sense of a word.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

We use WordNet (WN) as our sense inventory.,"{'title': 'Finding Predominant Senses. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The senses of a word  are each assigned a ranking score which sums over the distributional similarity scores of the neighbours and weights eachneighbour?s score by a WN Similarity score (Pat wardhan and Pedersen, 2003) between the sense of  and the sense of the neighbour that maximises the WN Similarity score.","{'title': 'Finding Predominant Senses.

3.1 Word Selection.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
In our experiments we used FINANCE and SPORTS domains.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"To ensure that a significant number of the chosen words are relevant for these domains, we did not choose the words for our experiments completely randomly.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The first selection criterionwe applied used the Subject Field Code (SFC) re 420 source (Magnini and Cavaglia`, 2000), which assignsdomain labels to synsets in WN version 1.6.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
We se lected all the polysemous nouns in WN 1.6 that have at least one synset labelled SPORT and one synset labelled FINANCE.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
This reduced the set of words to 38.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"However, some of these words were fairly obscure, did not occur frequently enough in one of the domain corpora or were simply too polysemous.We narrowed down the set of words using the crite ria: (1) frequency in the BNC 1000, (2) at most12 senses, and (3) at least 75 examples in each corpus.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards.

Finally a couple of words were removed because the domain-specific sense was particularly ob scure3.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The resulting set consists of 17 words4: club,manager, record, right, bill, check, competition, conversion, crew, delivery, division, fishing, reserve, re turn, score, receiver, running We refer to this set of words as FS cds.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"

For the annotation task we recruited linguistics stu dents from two universities.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
All ten annotators are native speakers of English.We set up annotation as an Open Mind Word Ex pert task5.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
Open Mind is a web based system for annotating sentences.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"

Only the sentence inwhich the word appears is presented (not more sur rounding sentences).,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"

The sentences to be annotated were randomly sampled from the corpora.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The corpora were first part of speech tagged and lemmatised using RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
Up to 125 sentences were randomly selected for each word from eachcorpus.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Sentences with clear problems (e.g. contain ing a begin or end of document marker, or mostly not text) were removed.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"

3.3 Characterisation of the Annotated Data.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
Most of the sentences were annotated by at least three people.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
Some sentences were only done by two annotators.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
The complete set of data comprises 33225 tagging acts.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
The inter-annotator agreement on the complete set of data was 65%6.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For the BNC data it was 60%, for the Sports data 65% and for the Finance data 69%.This is lower than reported for other sets of anno tated data (for example it was 75% for the nouns in the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task), but quite close to the reported 62.8% agreement between the first two taggings for single noun tagging for the SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task (Mihalceaet al, 2004).","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards.

The fairest comparison is probably be tween the latter and the inter-annotator agreement for the BNC data.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Reasons why our agreement is relatively low include the fact that almost all of the sentences are annotated by three people, and also the high degree of polysemy of this set of words.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
Problematic cases The unlisted category was used as a miscellaneous category.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
In some cases a sense was truly missing from the inventory (e.g. the word ?tie?,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
has a ?game?,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"

In other cases we had not recognised thatthe word was really part of a multiword (e.g. a num ber of sentences for the word ?chip?,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
contained themultiword ?blue chip?).,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
Finally there were a num ber of cases where the word had been assigned the wrong part of speech tag (e.g. the verb ?will?,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
had often been mistagged as a noun).,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
We identified and removed all these systematic problem cases from theunlisted senses.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
"After removing the problematic un listed cases, we had between 0.9% (FINANCE) and 4.5% (SPORTS) unlisted instances left.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
We also had between 1.8% (SPORTS) and 4.8% (BNC) unclearinstances.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
The percentage of unlisted instances re flects the fit of WN to the data whilst that of unclear cases reflects the generality of the corpus.6To compute inter-annotator agreement we used Amruta Pu randare and Ted Pedersen?s OMtoSVAL2 Package version 0.01.,"{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards.

"Surprisingly, eq sal words, which are not particularly salient in eitherdomain, also typically have lower entropy in the domain specific corpora compared to the BNC.","{'title': 'Creating the Three Gold Standards. ', 'number': '3'}"
