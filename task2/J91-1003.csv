Metonymy and metaphor are so poorly understood that widely divergent views exist about them and their relationship to each other.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"This section reviews research on metaphor (2.1), metonymy (2.2), the relationship between them (2.3), and the more general relationship between literalness and nonliteralness (2.4).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Four views of metaphor are critically discussed: the comparison view, the interactive view, the selection restriction violation view, and the conventional metaphor view.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Computational examples of each kind are included by Gentner, Indurkhya, Hobbs, Wilks, and Martin.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Space does not permit discussion of other AT work on metaphor by, e.g., Russell (1976) and Weiner (1984; 1985). a metaphor is a comparison in which one term (the tenor or subject of the comparison) is asserted to bear a partial resemblance (the ground of the comparison) to something else (the vehicle), the resemblance being insufficient to sustain a literal comparison.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"As with any comparison, there is always some residual dissimilarity (the tension) between the terms involved in the comparison, but comparison theorists tend not to emphasize this dissimilarity (Tourangeau and Sternberg 1982, p. 205, their italics).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"What is crucial in the comparison approach, then, is finding the correct ground in a metaphor.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"According to Tourangeau and Sternberg, Aristotle proposed the first comparison theory and suggested several principles for finding the ground of a metaphor.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Tourangeau and Sternberg reduce these principles to two basic ones: finding a category to which the tenor and vehicle belong and constructing an analogy involving them.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Gentner's (1983) Structure-Mapping Theory, which has been implemented in the Structure-Mapping Engine (Falkenhainer, Forbus and Gentner 1989), closely resembles a comparison view of metaphor.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The theory addresses literal similarity, analogy, abstraction, and anomaly, which Gentner refers to as four &quot;kinds of comparison.&quot; An algorithm compares the semantic information from two concepts represented as sets of properties.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Properties are either &quot;attributes,&quot; one-place predicates like LARGE(x), or &quot;relations,&quot; two-place predicates such as COLLIDE(x,y).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The four kinds of comparison are distinguished by the relative proportions of attributes and relations that are matched, and the forms of mappings established between them.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Mappings between relations are sought before those between attributes.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Pairs of relations are compared using the &quot;systematicity principle&quot; that regular structural correspondences should exist between terms occupying the same positions in those relations.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Mappings are purely structural and independent of the content of the relations (i.e., the predicates).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982) list some problems with the comparison view, including the following: (a) that everything has some feature or category that it shares with everything else, but we cannot combine just any two things in metaphor; (b) that the most obvious shared features are often irrelevant to a reading of the metaphor; (c) that even when the feature is relevant, it is often shared only metaphorically; ... and (e) that metaphors are novel and surprising is hard to reconcile with the idea that they rely completely on extant similarities (ibid., pp.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
226-227).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Johnson (1980) also notes problem (a) with comparison theories, pointing out that as a result they cannot account for the semantic tension between the two terms of a metaphor: the comparison theory ... tries to circumvent the experienced semantic strain by interpreting metaphor as nothing but a way of comparing two things to see in what respects they are alike.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"And since any two things are similar in some respects, this kind of theory can never explain what is interesting and important about metaphor (ibid., p. 52). novelty that metaphors create.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"According to Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982, p. 212), proponents of the interaction view include Black (1962), Hesse (1966), Miles (1967), Richards (1936), and Wheelwright (1962).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Interaction theorists argue that the vehicle of a metaphor is a template for seeing the tenor in a new way.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"This reorganization of the tenor is necessary, because the characteristics or features of the vehicle cannot be applied directly to the tenor; the features they 'share' are often only shared metaphorically.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"As Black (1962) observes, the ground of a metaphor may itself be nonliteral.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"'Men are wolves,' in Black's example, in part because both are predators; but they are predators in sharply different senses that may only strike us as similar when we interpret the metaphor.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Black's reading of this metaphor, we see competition in social relations as corresponding to predacity in beasts (Tourangeau and Sternberg 1982, pp.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
212-213).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"A problem with the interaction view is that theorists have not provided much detail about the processes involved, though Black (1962) does make some suggestions.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"According to Black, tenor and vehicle... each have a 'system of commonplaces' associated with them.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"These commonplaces are stereotypes, not necessarily definitional, not even necessarily true, just widely agreed upon.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In interpreting 'man is a wolf,' we 'evoke the wolf-system of related commonplaces' and are led by them 'to construct a corresponding system of implications about the principal subject (Man)' (Black, 1962, p. 41).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Black's view, then, interpretation involves not so much comparing tenor and vehicle for existing similarities, as construing them in a new way so as to create similarity between them (Tourangeau and Sternberg 1982, p. 213).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"One might distinguish, then, two main differences between the interaction and comparison views.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"First, similarities are &quot;created&quot; in the interaction view (accounting for the novelty and surprise in a metaphor) whereas only pre-existing similarities are found in the comparison view.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Second, a whole system of similarities are evoked between tenor and vehicle in the interactions view, whereas the comparisons view is based upon finding a single similarity.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"One version of the interaction view is the domains-interaction view, set forth by Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982), who take the view that features 'shared' by tenor and vehicle are often at best only analogous features, each limited in its application to one domain or another.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Of course, some features or dimensions are quite general, applying across the board to a number of domains (p. 218).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Among comparison and interaction theorists, much attention had been paid to selecting the comparisons or interactions in a metaphor.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The importance of analogy or correspondence in metaphor has been stressed by Gentner (1983), Ortony (1979), Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982), and Wilks (1978), among others.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Various mechanisms have been advanced for highlighting certain comparisons or interactions, including relevance (e.g., Hobbs 1983b; Tversky 1977) and salience (Ortony et al. 1985).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Among computational approaches, Indurkhya's (1988) Constrained Semantic Transference theory of metaphor can be viewed as a formalization of Black's interaction theory (ibid., p. 129).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Source and target domains are viewed as &quot;systems of relationships.&quot; In metaphorical interpretation, an &quot;implicative complex&quot; of the source domain is imposed on the target domain, thereby shaping the features of the target domain, which in turn produces changes in the features of the source domain, hence the &quot;interaction.&quot; It is assumed that a structural analogy underlies every metaphor (ibid., p. 129).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"A metaphor is identified with the formal notion of a T-MAP which is a pair ( F,S ) where F is a function that maps vocabulary of the source domain onto vocabulary of the target domain and S is a set of sentences from the source domain which are expected to transfer to the target domain.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"A metaphor is &quot;coherent&quot; if the transferred sentences S are logically consistent with the axioms of the target domain, and &quot;strongly coherent&quot; if they already lie in the deductive closure of those axioms (cf.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Stallard 1987, p. 181).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
S is thus the &quot;implicative complex&quot; of the source domain imposed on the target domain.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Every metaphorical interpretation of a given set of sentences is associated with a T-MAP.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
There may be several possible T-MAPs for a set of sentences.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
I would argue that Hobbs (1983a; 1983b) has also taken an interaction view of metaphor.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Hobbs' goal has been to develop a unified process of discourse interpretation based on the drawing of appropriate inferences from a large knowledge base, which Hobbs sometimes calls &quot;selective inferencing&quot; (e.g., Hobbs 1980).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Selective inferencing is concerned with drawing or refraining from drawing certain inferences in a controlled fashion (cf.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Hobbs 1983a).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
He argues that many problems have the same or almost the same inferencing solutions.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"These solutions are found via four separate semantic operations that all draw inferences from text (e.g., Hobbs 1977).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
2.1.3 The Selection Restrictions Violations View.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The selection restriction violation view has also been called &quot;the semantic deviance view&quot; (Johnson 1980, p. 50) and &quot;the anomaly view&quot; (Tourangeau and Sternberg 1982, p. 211).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Johnson (1980) describes this view as a common one among linguists; Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982) list the following people as holders of this view: Beardsley (1962), Bickerton (1969), Campbell (1975), Guenther (1975), Percy (1954), Van Dijk (1975), and Wheelwright (1962).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
To this list one might add Levin (1977).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Johnson (1980, p. 50) describes this view as where: metaphor constitutes a violation of selection restriction rules within a given context, where the fact of this violation is supposed to explain the semantic tension one experiences in comprehending any live metaphor.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The theory of metaphor in Preference Semantics (Wilks 1975; 1978) consists of a selection restrictions view and a comparison view.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In the theory, information about word senses is contained in knowledge structures called &quot;semantic formulas.&quot; An algorithm matches pairs of semantic formulas, seeking satisfied or violated preferences between them.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
A satisfied preference indicates a literal semantic relation; a violated preference indicates either a metaphorical or anomalous one.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
This part of the theory is implemented in a machine translation system (Wilks 1973).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"To distinguish metaphor from anomaly, a different knowledge structure and a second algorithm are used.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The algorithm, called projection, operates on a knowledge structure, called a pseudo-text, that contains lists of templates (a further kind of knowledge structure) linked by case ties.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
A brief example of projection is given for (1).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Example 3 &quot;My car drinks gasoline.&quot; Projection operates only on preference violations.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The best representation of (1) contains a preference violation, so projection is used.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The algorithm compares the template representation for the sentence [my+car drink gasoline] against templates from the pseudo-text of 'car' seeking &quot;the closest match,&quot; and selects fICengine (USE)#liquidl.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"(USE) is projected onto drink in the sentence representation which becomes [ny+car use gasoline] Example 4 &quot;Idi Amin is an animal&quot; (Johnson 1980, p. 51).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Example 5 &quot;People are not cattle&quot; (Hobbs 1983b, p. 134).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Example 6 &quot;No man is an Island&quot; (John Donne, Meditations XVII).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The main problem with the selection restrictions view is that perfectly well-formed sentences exist that have a metaphorical interpretation and yet contain no selection restriction violations (Johnson 1980; Ortony 1980; Reddy 1969); for example, in (3), there is a literal interpretation when uttered about a stone and a metaphorical one when said about a decrepit professor emeritus.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Sentences (4), (5) and (6) also have twin interpretations.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The existence of such sentences suggests that a condition that occasionally holds (i.e., a selection restriction violation) has been elevated into a necessary condition of metaphor (Johnson 1980).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Moreover, viewing metaphor only in terms of selection restriction violations ignores the influence of context: We seem to interpret an utterance metaphorically when to do so makes sense of more aspects of the total context than if the sentence is read literally.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Consider the simple case of the sentence All men are animals as uttered by Professor X to an introductory biology class and as uttered later by one of his female students to her roommate upon returning from a date.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In the latter instance the roommate understands the utterance as metaphorical (ibid., p. 51).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In a similar way, Ortony (1980) suggests that metaphor should be thought of as contextually anomalous.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"This means that a literal interpretation of the expression, be it a word, phrase, sentence, or an even larger unit of text, fails to fit the context (p. 73, his italics), so whether or not a sentence is a metaphor depends upon the context in which it is used: if something is a metaphor then it will be contextually anomalous if interpreted literally.... Insofar as the violation of selection restrictions can be interpreted in terms of semantic incompatibilities at the lexical level, such violations may sometimes be the basis of the contextual anomaly (ibid., p. 74).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
2.1.4 The Conventional Metaphor View.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Lakoff and Johnson (1980) have popularized the idea of conventional metaphors, also known as conceptual metaphors.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"They distinguish three main kinds: orientational, ontological, and structural.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Orientational metaphors are mainly to do with kinds of spatial orientation like up-down, in-out, and deep-shallow.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Example metaphors include MORE IS UP and HAPPY IS UP.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
They arise from human experience of spatial orientation and thus develop from the sort of bodies we have and the way they function in our physical environment.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Ontological metaphors arise from our basic human experiences with substances and physical objects (especially our own bodies).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Some examples are TIME IS A SUBSTANCE, THE MIND IS AN ENTITY, and THE VISUAL FIELD IS A CONTAINER.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Structural metaphors are elaborated orientational and ontological metaphors (cf.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Lakoff and Johnson 1980) in which concepts that correspond to natural kinds of experience, e.g., PHYSICAL ORIENTATIONS, SUBSTANCES, WAR, JOURNEYS, and BUILDINGS, are used to define other concepts, also natural kinds of experience, e.g., LOVE, TIME, IDEAS, UNDERSTANDING, and ARGUMENTS.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Some examples of structural metaphors are ARGUMENT IS WAR and TIME IS MONEY.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The ARGUMENT IS WAR metaphor forms a systematic way of talking about the battling aspects of arguing.... Because the metaphorical concept is systematic, the language we use to talk about the concept is systematic (ibid., p. 5).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"What Lakoff and Johnson fail to discuss is how metaphors in general, let alone individual metaphorical concepts, are recognized.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Martin's (1988; 1990) work has addressed this issue.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"He has pursued a conventional metaphor view using KODIAK (Wilensky 1984), a variant of Brachman's KLONE knowledge representation language.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Within KODIAK, metaphorical relationships are represented using a primitive link type called a &quot;VIEW.&quot; A VIEW &quot;is used to assert that... one concept may in certain circumstances be considered as another &quot;(Martin 1990, p. 59).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Martin's work, &quot;metaphor-maps,&quot; a kind of VIEW (ibid., p. 64), are used to represent conventional metaphors and the conceptual information they contain.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Metonymy involves &quot;using one entity to refer to another that is related to it&quot; (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, p. 35).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"&quot;The ham sandwich is waiting for his check.&quot; For example, in (2) the metonymy is that the concept for ham sandwich is related to an aspect of another concept, for &quot;the person who ordered the ham sandwich.&quot; Several attempts have been made to organize instances of metonymy into categories (e.g., Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Stern 1931; Yamanashi 1987) or &quot;metonymic concepts,&quot; as Lakoff and Johnson call them.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"

There has been some computational work on metonymy (Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983; Grosz et al. 1987; Hobbs and Martin 1987; Stallard 1987; Wilensky 1987).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The TEAM project (Grosz et al. 1987) handles metonymy, though metonymy is not mentioned by name but referred to instead as &quot;coercion,&quot; which &quot;occurs whenever some property of an object is used to refer indirectly to the object&quot; (ibid., p. 213).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Coercion is handled by &quot;coercion-relations;&quot; for example, a coercion relation could be used to understand that 'Fords' means &quot;cars whose CAR-MANUFACTURER is Ford&quot; (in Lakoff and Johnson's terms, this is an example of a PRODUCER FOR PRODUCT metonymic concept).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Grosz et al. (1987) note a similarity between coercion (i.e., metonymy) and modification in noun-noun compounds, and use &quot;modification relations&quot; to decide whether, e.g., &quot;U.S. ships&quot; means &quot;ships of U.S. registry&quot; or &quot;ships whose destination is the U.S.&quot; Hobbs and Martin (1987) and Stallard (1987) also discuss the relationship between metonymy and nominal compounds.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"

"Among the third group, two differences between metonymy and metaphor are commonly mentioned.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
One difference is that metonymy is founded on contiguity whereas metaphor is based on similarity (cf.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"

Contiguity and similarity are two kinds of association.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Contiguity refers to a state of being connected or touching whereas similarity refers to a state of being alike in essentials or having characteristics in common (Mish 1986).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"A second difference, advanced by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) for example, is that metaphor is &quot;principally a way of conceiving of one thing in terms of another, and its primary function is understanding&quot; (ibid., pp.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"36-37) whereas metonymy &quot;has primarily a referential function, that is, it allows us to use one entity to stand for another&quot; (ibid., their italics), though it has a role in understanding because it focuses on certain aspects of what is being referred to.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
There is little computational work about the relationship between metonymy and metaphor.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Stallard (1987) distinguishes separate roles for metonymy and metaphor in word sense extension.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"

"In knowledge representation, metonymic and metaphorical relations are both represented in the knowledge representation language CycL (Lenat and Guha 1990).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Much of the preceding material assumes what Gibbs (1984) calls the &quot;literal meanings hypothesis,&quot; which is that sentences have well defined literal meanings and that computation of the literal meaning is a necessary step on the path to understanding speakers' utterances (ibid., p. 275).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"There are a number of points here, which Gibbs expands upon in his paper.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"One point concerns the traditional notion of literal meaning, that all sentences have literal meanings that are entirely determined by the meanings of their component words, and that the literal meaning of a sentence is its meaning independent of context.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"A second point concerns the traditional view of metaphor interpretation, though Gibbs' criticism applies to metonymy interpretation also.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Using Searle's (1979) views on metaphor as an example, he characterizes the typical model for detecting nonliteral meaning as a three-stage process: [11 compute the literal meaning of a sentence, [21 decide if the literal meaning is defective, and if so, [3] seek an alternative meaning, i.e., a metaphorical one (though, presumably, a metonymic interpretation might also be sought at this stage).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Gibbs (1984, p. 275) concludes that the distinction between literal and metaphoric meanings has &quot;little psychological validity.&quot; Among AT researchers, Martin (1990) shares many of Gibbs's views in criticizing the &quot;literal meaning first approach&quot; (ibid., p. 24).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Martin suggests a two-stage process for interpreting sentences containing metaphors: [1] parse the sentence to produce a syntactic parse tree plus primal (semantic) representation, and [21 apply inference processes of &quot;concretion&quot; and &quot;metaphoric viewing&quot; to produce the most detailed semantic representation possible.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The primal representation represents a level of semantic interpretation that is explicitly in need of further processing.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Although it is obviously related to what has traditionally been called a literal meaning, it should not be thought of as a meaning at all.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The primal representation should be simply considered as an intermediate stage in the interpretation process where only syntactic and lexical information has been utilized (ibid., p. 90, his italics).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"However, Martin believes that at least some sentence meaning is independent of context because the primal representation contains part of the primal content of an utterance and [t]he Primal Content represents the meaning of an utterance that is derivable from knowledge of the conventions of a language, independent of context (ibid.).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"

"I agree with Ortony's remark that metaphor be viewed as contextual anomaly, but would suggest two modifications.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"

"Second, I prefer the term contextual constraint violation because [1] one of the phenomena detected by contextual violation is anomaly and [2] the selection restriction/preference (on which the met* method is based) is a kind of lexical contextual constraint.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The section starts with an explanation of some of the linguistic background behind the met* method.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
I have argued elsewhere (Fass 1989a) that understanding natural language (or semantic interpretation) be viewed as the integration of constraints from language and from context.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"Some language constraints are syntactic, while others are semantic.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"Some language constraints are lexical constraints; that is, constraints possessed by lexical items (words and fixed phrases).","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"Lexical syntactic constraints include those on word order, number, and tense.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"This sec tion describes three lexical semantic constraints: preferences, assertions, and a lexical notion of relevance.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"Preferences (Wilks 1973), selection restrictions (Katz 1964), and expectations (Schank 1975) are the same (see Fass 1989c; Fass and Wilks 1983; Wilks and Fass in press): all are restrictions possessed by senses of lexical items of certain parts of speech about the semantic classes of lexical items with which they co-occur.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Thus an adjective sense has a preference for the semantic class of nouns with which it co-occurs and a verb sense has preferences for the semantic classes of nouns that fill its case roles.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the main sense of the verb 'drink' prefers an animal to fill its agent case role, i.e., it is animals that drink.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"The assertion of semantic information was noted by Lees (1960) in the formation of noun phrases and later developed by Katz (1964) as the process of &quot;attribution.&quot; Assertions contain information that is possessed by senses of lexical items of certain parts of speech and that is imposed onto senses of lexical items of other parts of speech, e.g., the adjective 'female' contains information that any noun to which it applies is of the female sex.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Lexical syntactic and semantic constraints are enforced at certain places in sentences which I call dependencies.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"

"In (15), 'the' and 'plough' both apply constraints upon 'ship,' and 'the' and 'plough' apply constraints on 'waves.'","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"

This notion of relevance is used in finding the relevant analogies that distinguish metaphorical from anomalous relations; it is also used when finding CO-AGENT FOR ACTIVITY metonymies.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Relevance divides the set of cells from the source sense-frame into two subsets.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
One cell is selected as relevant given the context; the remaining cells are termed nonrelevant.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"

Five types of metonymic concepts are currently distinguished.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"Examples of two of the metonymic concepts, CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS and ARTIST FOR ART FORM, have already been given.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"The remaining three are PART FOR WHOLE, PROPERTY FOR WHOLE, and CO-AGENT FOR ACTIVITY.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
&quot;Arthur Ashe is black&quot; (= skin colored black --+ PART FOR WHOLE).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
&quot;John McEnroe is white&quot; (= skin colored white -4 PART FOR WHOLE).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"In (22) and (23), the skins of Arthur Ashe and John McEnroe, parts of their bodies, are colored black (white).","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
&quot;John McEnroe is yellow&quot; (= limited in bravery —* PROPERTY FOR WHOLE).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
&quot;Natalia Zvereva is green&quot; (= limited in experience -4 PROPERTY FOR WHOLE).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"In (24), for example, John McEnroe is limited with respect to his bravery, a property possessed by humans and other animals.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
&quot;Ashe played McEnroe&quot; (= tennis with McEnroe -4 CO-AGENT FOR ACTIVITY).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
These concepts are encoded in metonymic inference rules in CS (see diamond 2 in Figure 4).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The rules are ordered from most common (synecdoche) to least.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"The order used is PART FOR WHOLE, PROPERTY FOR WHOLE, CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS, CO-AGENT FOR ACTIVITY, and ARTIST FOR ART FORM.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"The first two concepts, PART FOR WHOLE and PROPERTY FOR WHOLE, are source-driven; the others are target-driven.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The difference in direction seems to be dependent on the epistemological structure of the knowledge being related by the different inferences.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"PART FOR WHOLE metonymies are source-driven, perhaps because the epistemological nature of parts and wholes is that a part generally belongs to fewer wholes than wholes have parts, hence it makes sense to drive inferencing from a part (source) toward the whole (target) than vice versa.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"In CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS (target-driven), on the other hand, the epistemological nature of containers and contents is that the containers generally mentioned in CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS metonymies are artifacts designed for the function of containing — hence one can usually find quite specific information about the typical contents of a certain container, for example, some glasses as in (7) — whereas the contents do not generally have the function of being the contents of something.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"Hence it makes sense to drive inferencing from the container, and the function it performs, toward the contents than vice versa.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The same reasoning applies to ARTIST FOR ART FORM (target-driven).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
An artist has the vocation of creating art: that is his/her purpose.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
A further step in collation distinguishes metaphorical from anomalous semantic relations.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"Recall that a metaphorical relation contains a relevant analogy, as in (15) and (20), while an anomalous relation does not, as in (21).","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
A relevant analogy is found by matching the relevant cell from the source sense-frame with one of the cells from the target sense-frame.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"If the match of cells is composed of a set of sister network paths between corresponding word senses in those cells, then this is interpreted as analogical and hence indicative of a metaphorical relation.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Any other match of cells is interpreted as not analogical and thus an anomalous semantic relation is recognized (see Fass 1986; 1987).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"The third component of CS is the semantic vector which is a form of representation, like the sense-frame; but sense-frames represent lexical knowledge, whereas semantic vectors represent coherence.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Semantic vectors are therefore described as a kind of coherence representation.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
A semantic vector is a data structure that contains nested labels and ordered arrays structured by a simple dependency syntax.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The labels form into sets.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The outer sets of labels indicate the application of the three kinds of lexical semantic constraints.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The outermost set of labels is 'preference' and 'assertion.',"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The middle set is 'relevant' and 'nonrelevant.',"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The innermost set is the kind of mapping used: 'network path' and 'cell matches.',"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The nesting of labels shows the order in which each source of knowledge was introduced.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The ordered arrays represent the subkinds of each kind of mapping.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Five-column arrays are for the five network paths; seven-column arrays are for the seven types of cell match.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Each column contains a positive number that shows the number of occurrences of a particular network path or cell match.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The fourth component of CS is the process of screening.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"During analysis of a sentence constituent, a semantic vector is created for every pairwise combination of word senses.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
These word sense combinations are called semantic readings or simply &quot;readings.&quot; Each reading has an associated semantic vector.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Screening chooses between two semantic vectors and hence their attached semantic readings.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
Rank orderings among semantic relations are applied.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"In the event of a tie, a measure of conceptual similarity is used.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The ranking of semantic relations aims to achieve the most coherent possible interpretation of a reading.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The class of preference-based semantic relations takes precedence over the class of assertion-based semantic relations for lexical disambiguation.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The rank order among preference-based semantic relations is literal metaphorical —> anomalous.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
If the semantic vectors are still tied then the measure of conceptual similarity is employed.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
This measure was initially developed to test a claim by Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982) about the aptness of a metaphor.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
"They contend that aptness is a function of the distance between the conceptual domains of the source and target involved: the claim is that the more distant the domains, the better the metaphor.","{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
This is discussed further in Section 5.,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
The conceptual similarity measure is also used for lexical ambiguity resolution (see Fass 1988c).,"{'title': '3. met* Method', 'number': '3'}"
CS has been implemented in the meta5 natural language program.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"The meta5 program is written in Quintus Prolog and consists of a lexicon holding the sense-frames of just over 500 word senses, a small grammar, and semantic routines that embody collation and screening, the two processes of CS.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"The program is syntax-driven, a form of control carried over from the structure of earlier programs by Boguraev (1979) and Huang (1985), on which meta5 is based.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"Meta5 analyzes sentences, discriminates the seven kinds of semantic relation between pairs of word senses in those sentences (i.e., the program recognizes metonymies, metaphors, and so on), and resolves any lexical ambiguity in those sentences.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"Meta5 analyzes all the sentences given in Sections 3 and 4, plus a couple more metaphorical sentences discussed in Section 7.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
Below are simplified versions of some of the metonymic inference rules used in meta5.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"The metonymic concepts used in CS contain three key elements: the conceptual relationship involved, the direction of inference, and a replacement of the source or target.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
The metonymic inference rules in meta5 contain all three key elements.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"The rules, though written in a prolog-like format, assume no knowledge of Prolog on the part of the reader and fit with the role of metonymy shown in Figures 1 and 4.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
Each metonymic inference rule has a left-hand side and a right-hand side.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"The lefthand side is the topmost statement and is of the form metonymic_inference_rule(Source, Target).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
The right-hand side consists of the remaining statements.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"These statements represent the conceptual relationship and the direction of inference, except for the bottom most one, which controls the substitution of the discovered metonym for either the source or target: this statement is always a call to find a new sense-network path.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"This rule represents PROPERTY FOR WHOLE, which is source-driven.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
Statement [1] represents the conceptual relationship and direction of inference.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
The conceptual relationship is that the source is a property possessed by the whole in a propertywhole relation.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"The inference is driven from the source: find_cell searches through the source's list of cells for one referring to a &quot;whole&quot; of which the source is a &quot;part.&quot; Statement [2] controls the substitution of the discovered metonym: the &quot;whole&quot; is the substitute metonym that replaces the source, and the next sense-network path is sought between the whole and the target.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"Again, the inference in ARTIST FOR ART FORM is from the target.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
The target is a person who is an &quot;artist&quot; in an artist—art form relation.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
The occupation of the person is found by searching up the sense-network ([1]).,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"The list of cells associated with the occupation are searched for a cell describing the main activity involved in the occupation ([2]), e.g., a cook cooks food and an artist makes art forms.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"Checks are done to confirm that any activity found is indeed making an art form, i.e., that the &quot;making&quot; involved is a type of creating ([3]) and that the &quot;art form&quot; is a type of art forml ([4]).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
The &quot;art form&quot; is the substitute metonym that replaces the target.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
A new sense-network path is computed between the source and the art form ([5]).,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
I will now describe how meta5 recognizes some metonymies and metaphors.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"In (19), between 'Bach' and the twelfth sense of 'play' in meta5's lexicon (meaning &quot;to play music&quot;), there is a chain of metonymies plus a literal relation.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
The chain consists of ARTIST FOR ART FORM and CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS metonymies.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
Both metonymic concepts are target-driven.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"
"In ARTIST FOR ART FORM the inference is from the ARTIST (the target) to the ART FORM (the source), so the substitute metonym replaces the target (the ARTIST) if the inference is successful.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '4'}"

We return here to Gibbs' point concerning the traditional notion of literal meaning that [1] all sentences have literal meanings that are entirely determined by the meanings of their component words and that [2] the literal meaning of a sentence is its meaning independent of context.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"

"&quot;The ham sandwich is waiting for his check.&quot; However, in metonymy, a whole concept is related to an aspect of another concept.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, in (2) the metonymy is that the concept for ham sandwich is related to an aspect of another concept, for &quot;the man who ate a ham sandwich.&quot; Regarding how that conceptual information is related: in the case of metaphor, the met* method assigns a central role to finding an analogy, and an analogy between two terms is due to some underlying similarity between them (the ground), e.g., in the analogy that animals drinking potable liquids is like cars using gasoline, the underlying similarity is that both animals and cars ingest liquids.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"In an analogy, the relationship between aspects of two concepts is purely structural.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"In metonymies, however, the relationships are &quot;knowledge-laden&quot; connections, e.g., PART-WHOLE and CONTAINER-CONTENTS.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"

"Collation and the met* method have certain similarities with the comparison view of metaphor, especially in the cell matching process.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The relevant analogies discovered in CS are indeed, to quote Tourangeau and Sternberg, &quot;a comparison in which one term... is asserted to bear a partial resemblance to something else.&quot; The collation process gives quite a clear picture of the ground and tension in a metaphor.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The ground is the most specific statement that subsumes both statements that figure in the analogy, e.g., [it1, ingest1, liquidl] is the ground for the analogy involving [anima11, drinkl, drinkl ] and [car1, use2, gasoline11 (see Figures 8 and 9).","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Moreover, the details of the process match well Aristotle's two basic principles for finding the ground of a metaphor in that both terms in a metaphorical relation belong to a common category (in the example above, the common categories are it1, ingest1, and liquidl) and an analogy is found between them.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
The collation process also takes care of many of the problems Tourangeau and Sternberg (1980) note with the comparison view.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Regarding the problem that &quot;everything shares some feature or category... with everything else,&quot; CS is in agreement: the only significant combination of features in a metaphor are those involved in a relevant analogy.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The problem that &quot;the most obvious shared features are often irrelevant,&quot; i.e., that the most obvious shared features are irrelevant to a metaphor, is borne out by experience with CS — for example, animals and cars share some basic physical objectlike properties, but these have a minor role in understanding cars drinking.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The met* method bears out another problem that, &quot;even when a feature is relevant, it is often shared only metaphorically.&quot; Finally, with the problem that novel metaphors cannot be based on &quot;extant similarities,&quot; — the relevant analogies found in the met* method are not &quot;extant&quot; but have to be actively discovered.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"In Section 2, two main differences were noted between the interaction and comparison views: first, that similarities are &quot;created&quot; in the interaction view, whereas only pre-existing similarities are found in the comparison view, and second, that a whole system of similarities are evoked in the interactions view, unlike the comparisons view, which focuses upon finding a single similarity.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Regarding the first difference, I would argue that the difference is a mistaken one and that interaction theorists are simply using a sophisticated form of comparison.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"This is quite evident when one examines, for example, the methods Tourangeau and Sternberg propose for relating features across domains in their theory.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The second of Aristotle's basic principles is finding an analogy, yet Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982, p. 218) themselves say that, &quot;in a sense, we are proposing that metaphors are analogies that include both tenor and vehicle and their different domains as terms.&quot; And, of course, finding an analogy is central to the met* method on CS.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Regarding the second difference, I would agree that finding a system of commonplaces is distinctive.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"However, the extensions to CS described in Section 6 move toward the direction of finding a system of commonplaces in that the deeper semantic vectors, and sentence representations shown in Figures 20 and 21 contain the information crucial to finding a system of commonplaces.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Having identified the crucial analogy in (20), the deeper semantic vector contains the two pairs of matched relevant cells that provide the core analogy on which the metaphorical interpretation of (20) is built: ffanimall, drink1, drink1J, [car1, use2, gasoline1]] Ranima11, drink1, drinkl], [vehiclel, use2, gasolinel]] With this information at hand, the sense-frames for word senses in analogical correspondence — the verb senses drink1 and use2, the noun senses animall and car1, animal1 and vehicle1, and drinkl and gasolinel — can be systematically expanded to uncover deeper commonplaces between animals and cars.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"In conclusion, the view of metonymy and metaphor in the met* method is consistent with much of the literature on these phenomena.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The met* method is consistent with the view that the primary function of metaphor is understanding while that of metonymy is referential, like anaphora.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Nevertheless, metonymy and metaphor do have much in common: both might be described as forms of &quot;conceptual ellipsis,&quot; a shorthand way of expressing ideas.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The met* method in its present serial form recognizes literalness, metonymy, metaphor, and anomaly in the following order and by the following characteristics.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The above analysis also illustrates, I hope, why metonymy and metaphor are easily confused: both are nonliteral and are found through the discovery of some aspect (a property) shared by the source, a preference, and the target, in the above case a surface noun.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The differences are (a) how that aspect is selected, (b) the operations that follow, (c) the effect those operations produce, and (d) subsequent processing.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"In the case of metonymy, (a) the selected aspect forms a regular semantic relationship with a property from the target; (b) there is substitution, i.e., replacement of one concept with another; (c) hence the apparent referential function of metonymy; and (d) is unclear at present.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"In the case of metaphor, (a) the selected aspect is relevant; (b) forms an analogy with another aspect from the target; and (c) the effect is of surprise discovery of similarity between the two concepts; and (d) the discovered analogy is used to unearth further similarities between the two concepts (i.e, to deepen the analogy) and to guide subsequent sentence interpretation.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Moreover, the view of metaphor in CS contains elements of the selection restrictions view, the comparisons view, and the interactions view of metaphor.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
It should be emphasized that the met* method has only been applied to a small set of English sentences.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Metonymy interpretation has been investigated only for adjective-noun and subject-verb-object constructions; metaphor interpretation, only for the latter.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
The best avenue for progress with the met* method appears to be the extensions to metaphor interpretation described in Section 6.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
In the meantime I am looking for sentences that contain semantic relations consisting of a metonymy (or chain of metonymies) followed by a metaphor.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Example 32 &quot;America believes in democracy&quot; (Hobbs 1983b, p. 134).","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"On a related point, some sentences are interesting in this respect because they have either a metaphorical or metonymic interpretation.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"In (32), for example, &quot;Are we viewing America metaphorically as something which can believe, or are we using it metonymically to refer to the typical inhabitant, or the majority of inhabitants, of America?&quot; (Ibid., p. 135).","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"Example 33 &quot;Prussia invaded France in 1870.&quot; Sentence (33), which was discussed in a group working on beliefs at the CRL (see Acknowledgments), also has separate metonymic and metaphorical interpretations.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
The key semantic relation is between 'Prussia' and 'invade.',"{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"The relation is nonliteral because 'army' is the expected agent of 'invade' and 'Prussia' is a country, not an army.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"What, then, is the semantic relation between 'Prussia' and 'army'?","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
"One possibility is that a chain of metonymies is involved, that the army is controlled by the government which also controls Prussia.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
A second possibility is that Prussia is understood metaphorically as being an animate thing that extends itself into France.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '6'}"
