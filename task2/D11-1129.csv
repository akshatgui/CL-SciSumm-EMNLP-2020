Modelling compositional meaning for sentences using empirical distributional methods has been a challenge for computational linguists.,{}
We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (2010) using data from the BNC and evaluate it.,{}
The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments.,{}
"The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences.",{}
"Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second.",{}
The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.,{}

"The distributional models have found their way into real world applications such as thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran, 2004) or automated essay marking (Landauer, 1997), and have connections to semantically motivated information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This two-sortedness of defining properties of meaning: ‘logical form’ versus ‘contextual use’, has left the quest for ‘what is the foundational structure of meaning?’ even more of a challenge.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

They developed a unified mathematical framework whereby a sentence vector is by definition a function of the Kronecker product of its word vectors.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
A concrete instantiation of this theory was exemplified on a toy hand crafted corpus by Grefenstette et al. (2011).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Such models consist of a pairing of syntactic interpretation rules (in the form of a grammar) with semantic interpretation rules, as exemplified by the simple model presented in Figure 1.","{'title': '2 Two Orthogonal Semantic Models', 'number': '2'}"

"One major drawback is that the result of such analysis can only deal with truth or falsity as the meaning of a sentence, and says nothing about the closeness in meaning or topic of expressions beyond their truth-conditions and what models satisfy them, hence do not perform well on language tasks such as search.","{'title': '2 Two Orthogonal Semantic Models', 'number': '2'}"

One consequence of this parity is that the grammatical reductions of a pregroup grammar can be directly transformed into linear maps that act on vectors.,"{'title': '3 A Hybrid Logico-Distributional Model', 'number': '3'}"

Each type n cancels out with its right adjoint nr from the right and its left adjoint nl from the left; mathematically speaking these mean3 nln < 1 and nnr < 1 Here 1 is the unit of concatenation: 1n = n1 = n.

The additive and multiplicative models are simply applications of vector addition and component-wise multiplication.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"We invite the reader to consult (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) for the description of Kintsch’s additive model and parametric choices.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Model Parameters To provide the most accurate comparison with the existing multiplicative model, and exploiting the aforementioned feature that the categorical model can be built “on top of” existing lexical distributional models, we used the parameters described by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) to reproduce the vectors evaluated in the original experiment as our noun vectors.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
All vectors were built from a lemmatised version of the BNC.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"The noun basis was the 2000 most common context words, basis weights were the probability of context words given the target word divided by the overall probability of the context word.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
Intransitive verb functionvectors were trained using the procedure presented in §4.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Since the dataset only contains intransitive verbs and nouns, we used S = N. The cosine measure of vectors was used as a similarity metric.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
First Experiment Results In Table 3 we present the comparison of the selected models.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Our categorical model performs significantly better than the existing second-place (Kintsch) and obtains a ρ quasiidentical to the multiplicative model, indicating significant correlation with the annotator scores.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"There is not a large difference between the mean High score and mean Low score, but the distribution in Figure 6 shows that our model makes a non-negligible distinction between high similarity phrases and low similarity phrases, despite the absolute scores not being different by more than a few percentiles.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Second Dataset Description The second dataset6, developed by the authors, follows the format of the (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) dataset used for the first experiment, with the exception that the target and landmark verbs are transitive, and an object noun is provided in addition to the subject noun, hence forming a small transitive sentence.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"The dataset comprises 200 entries consisting of sentence pairs (hence a total of 400 sentences) constructed by following the procedure outlined in §4 of (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008), using transitive verbs from CELEX7.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"For examples of these sentences, see Table 4.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"The dataset was split into four sections of 100 entries each, with guaranteed 50% exclusive overlap with exactly two other datasets.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Each section was given to a group of evaluators, with a total of 25, who were asked to form simple transitive sentence pairs from the verbs, subject and object provided in each entry; for instance ‘the table showed the result’ from ‘table show result’.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"The evaluators were then asked to rate the semantic similarity of each verb pair within the context of those sentences, and offer a score between 1 and 7 for each entry.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Each entry was given an arbitrary classification of HIGH or LOW by the authors, for the purpose of calculating mean high/low scores for each model.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, the first two pairs in table 4 were classified as HIGH, whereas the second two pairs as LOW.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Evaluation Methodology The evaluation methodology for the second experiment was identical to that of the first, as are the scales for means and scores.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Here also, Spearman’s ρ is deemed a more rigorous way of determining how well a model tracks difference in meaning.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
This is both because of the imprecise nature of the classification of verb pairs as HIGH or LOW; and since the objective similarity scores produced by a model that distinguishes sentences of different meaning from those of similar meaning can be renormalised in practice.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
Therefore the delta between HIGH means and LOW mean cannot serve as a definite indication of the practical applicability (or lack thereof) of semantic models; the means are provided just to aid comparison with the results of the first experiment.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Model Parameters As in the first experiment, the lexical vectors from (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) were used for the other models evaluated (additive, multiplicative and baseline)8 and for the noun vec8Kintsch was not evaluated as it required optimising model parameters against a held-out segment of the test set, and we could not replicate the methodology of Mitchell and Lapata tors of our categorical model.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
Transitive verb vectors were trained as described in §4 with S = N⊗N.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
Second Experiment Results The results for the models evaluated against the second dataset are presented in Table 5.,"{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"We observe a significant (according to p < 0.0.5) improvement in the alignment of our categorical model with the human judgements, from 0.17 to 0.21.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"The additive model continues to make little distinction between senses of the verb during composition, and the multiplicative model’s alignment does not change, but becomes statistically indistinguishable from the non-compositional baseline model.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"Once again we note that the high-low means are not very indicative of model performance, as the difference between high mean and the low mean of the categorical model is much smaller than that of the both the baseline model and multiplicative model, despite better alignment with annotator judgements.","{'title': '6 Evaluation', 'number': '6'}"
"In this paper, we described an implementation of the categorical model of meaning (Coecke et al., 2010), which combines the formal logical and the empirical distributional frameworks into a unified semantic model.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"The implementation is based on building matrices for words with relational types (adjectives, verbs), and vectors for words with atomic types (nouns), based on data from the BNC.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"We then show how to apply verbs to their subject/object, in order to compute the meaning of intransitive and transitive sentences.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
(2008) with full confidence.,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"Other work uses matrices to model meaning (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Guevara, 2010), but only for adjective-noun phrases.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"Our approach easily applies to such compositions, as well as to sentences containing combinations of adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"The other key difference is that they learn their matrices in a top-down fashion, i.e. by regression from the composite adjective-noun context vectors, whereas our model is bottom-up: it learns sentence/phrase meaning compositionally from the vectors of the compartments of the composites.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"Finally, very similar functions, for example a verb with argument alternations such as ‘break’ in ‘Y breaks’ and ‘X breaks Y’, are not treated as unrelated.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"The matrix of the intransitive ‘break’ uses the corpusobserved information about the subject of break, including that of ‘Y’, similarly the matrix of the transitive ‘break’ uses information about its subject and object, including that of ‘X’ and ‘Y’.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"We leave a thorough study of these phenomena, which fall under providing a modular representation of passiveactive similarities, to future work.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"We evaluated our model in two ways: first against the word disambiguation task of Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive verbs, and then against a similar new experiment for transitive verbs, which we developed.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
Our findings in the first experiment show that the categorical method performs on par with the leading existing approaches.,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
This should not surprise us given that the context is so small and our method becomes similar to the multiplicative model of Mitchell and Lapata (2008).,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"However, our approach is sensitive to grammatical structure, leading us to develop a second experiment taking this into account and differentiating it from models with commutative composition operations.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"The second experiment’s results deliver the expected qualitative difference between models, with our categorical model outperforming the others and showing an increase in alignment with human judgements in correlation with the increase in sentence complexity.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"We use this second evaluation principally to show that there is a strong case for the development of more complex experiments measuring not only the disambiguating qualities of compositional models, but also their syntactic sensitivity, which is not directly measured in the existing experiments.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"These results show that the high level categorical distributional model, uniting empirical data with logical form, can be implemented just like any other concrete model.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
Furthermore it shows better results in experiments involving higher syntactic complexity.,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"This is just the tip of the iceberg: the mathematics underlying the implementation ensures that it uniformly scales to larger, more complicated sentences and enables it to compare synonymity of sentences that are of different grammatical structure.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"Treatment of function words such as ‘that’, ‘who’, as well as logical words such as quantifiers and conjunctives are left to future work.","{'title': '8 Future Work', 'number': '8'}"

"As mentioned by one of the reviewers, our pregroup approach to grammar flattens the sentence representation, in that the verb is applied to its subject and object at the same time; whereas in other approaches such as CCG, it is first applied to the object to produce a verb phrase, then applied to the subject to produce the sentence.","{'title': '8 Future Work', 'number': '8'}"
