"Let a parse tree T be defined as a set of triples (s, t, X)—where s denotes the position of the first symbol in a constituent, t denotes the position of the last symbol, and X represents a terminal or nonterminal symbol—meeting the following three requirements: Let Tc denote the &quot;correct&quot; parse (the one in the treebank) and let TG denote the &quot;guessed&quot; parse (the one output by the parsing algorithm).","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"Let NG denote ITGI, the number of nonterminals in the guessed parse tree, and let Nc denote ITc I, the number of nonterminals in the correct parse tree.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"

"A constituent (s,t, X) E TG is correct according to Labelled Match if and only if (s, t, X) E T. In other words, a constituent in the guessed parse tree is correct if and only if it occurs in the correct parse tree.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
The next level of strictness is Bracketed Match.,"{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"

Consistent Brackets is like Bracketed Match in that the label is ignored.,"{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"

(6) Consistent Brackets Tree Rate = 1 if C = NG.,"{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
This metric is closely related to the Bracketed Tree Rate.,"{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"In the case where the parses are binary branching, the two metrics are the same.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
This criterion is also called the Zero Crossing Brackets Rate.,"{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"The preceding six metrics each correspond to cells in the following table: Despite this long list of possible metrics, there is only one metric most parsing algorithms attempt to maximize, namely the Labelled Tree Rate.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"That is, most parsing algorithms assume that the test corpus was generated by the model, and then attempt to evaluate the following expression, where E denotes the expected value operator: TG arg mTaxE( 1 if = Nc) (1) This is true of the Labelled Tree Algorithm and stochastic versions of Earley's Algorithm (Stolcke, 1993), and variations such as those used in Picky parsing (Magerman and Weir, 1992).","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"Even in probabilistic models not closely related to PCFGs, such as Spatter parsing (Magerman, 1994), expression (1) is still computed.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"One notable exception is Brill's Transformation-Based Error Driven system (Brill, 1993), which induces a set of transformations designed to maximize the Consistent Brackets Recall Rate.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"However, Brill's system is not probabilistic.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"Intuitively, if one were to match the parsing algorithm to the evaluation criterion, better performance should be achieved.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"Ideally, one might try to directly maximize the most commonly used evaluation criteria, such as Consistent Brackets Recall (Crossing Brackets) Rate.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"Unfortunately, this criterion is relatively difficult to maximize, since it is time-consuming to compute the probability that a particular constituent crosses some constituent in the correct parse.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"On the other hand, the Bracketed Recall and Bracketed Tree Rates are easier to handle, since computing the probability that a bracket matches one in the correct parse is inexpensive.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
It is plausible that algorithms which optimize these closely related criteria will do well on the analogous Consistent Brackets criteria.,"{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"When building an actual system, one should use the metric most appropriate for the problem.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"

"A single error in the syntactic representation of a query will likely result in an error in the semantic representation, and therefore in an incorrect database query, leading to an incorrect result.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"For instance, if the user request &quot;Find me all flights on Tuesday&quot; is misparsed with the prepositional phrase attached to the verb, then the system might wait until Tuesday before responding: a single error leads to completely incorrect behavior.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, the Labelled Tree criterion is appropriate.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"On the other hand, consider a machine assisted translation system, in which the system provides translations, and then a fluent human manually edits them.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"Imagine that the system is given the foreign language equivalent of &quot;His credentials are nothing which should be laughed at,&quot; and makes the single mistake of attaching the relative clause at the sentential level, translating the sentence as &quot;His credentials are nothing, which should make you laugh.&quot; While the human translator must make some changes, he certainly needs to do less editing than he would if the sentence were completely misparsed.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"
"The more errors there are, the more editing the human translator needs to do.","{'title': '2 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '2'}"

"One could use the Labelled Tree Algorithm, which would maximize the expected number of exactly correct parses.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"However, since the number of correct constituents is a better measure of application performance for this domain than the number of correct trees, perhaps one should use an algorithm which maximizes the Labelled Recall criterion, rather than the Labelled Tree criterion.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"The Labelled Recall Algorithm finds that tree TG which has the highest expected value for the Labelled Recall Rate, LINc (where L is the number of correct labelled constituents, and Nc is the number of nodes in the correct parse).","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"This can be written as follows: It is not immediately obvious that the maximization of expression (2) is in fact different from the maximization of expression (1), but a simple example illustrates the difference.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"The following grammar generates four trees with equal probability: For the first tree, the probabilities of being correct are S: 100%; A:50%; and C: 25%.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
Similar counting holds for the other three.,"{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, the expected value of L for any of these trees is 1.75.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"On the other hand, the optimal Labelled Recall parse is This tree has 0 probability according to the grammar, and thus is non-optimal according to the Labelled Tree Rate criterion.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"However, for this tree the probabilities of each node being correct are S: 100%; A: 50%; and 8: 50%.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"The expected value of L is 2.0, the highest of any tree.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
This tree therefore optimizes the Labelled Recall Rate.,"{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
We now derive an algorithm for finding the parse that maximizes the expected Labelled Recall Rate.,"{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"We do this by expanding expression (2) out into a probabilistic form, converting this into a recursive equation, and finally creating an equivalent dynamic programming algorithm.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"

"Now, given a PCFG with start symbol S, the following equality holds: By rearranging the summation in expression (5) and then substituting this equality, we get At this point, it is useful to introduce the Inside and Outside probabilities, due to Baker (1979), and explained by Lan and Young (1990).","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"The Inside probability is defined as e(s,t, X) = P(X Os) and the Outside probability is f(s,t, X) = P(S 3-1 X n W1 wt-1-1)• Note that while Baker and others have used these probabilites for inducing grammars, here they are used only for parsing.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"Let us define a new function, g(s,t, X).","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"

This equation can be converted into the dynamic programming algorithm shown in Figure 1.,"{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"For a grammar with r rules and k nonterminals, the run time of this algorithm is 0(n3 kn2) since there are two layers of outer loops, each with run time at most n, and an inner loop, over nonterminals and n. However, this is dominated by the computation of the Inside and Outside probabilities, which takes time 0(rn3).","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"
"By modifying the algorithm slightly to record the actual split used at each node, we can recover the best parse.","{'title': '3 Labelled Recall Parsing', 'number': '3'}"

"Thus, although the Labelled Recall Algorithm could be used in these domains, perhaps maximizing a criterion that is more closely tied to the domain will produce better results.","{'title': '4 Bracketed Recall Parsing', 'number': '4'}"
"Ideally, we would maximize the Consistent Brackets Recall Rate directly.","{'title': '4 Bracketed Recall Parsing', 'number': '4'}"
"However, since it is time-consuming to deal with Consistent Brackets, we instead use the closely related Bracketed Recall Rate.","{'title': '4 Bracketed Recall Parsing', 'number': '4'}"

"We also display these statistics for the paired differences between the algorithms The only statistically significant difference is that for Consistent Brackets Recall Rate, which was significant to the 2% significance level (paired t-test).","{'title': '5 Experimental Results', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, use of the Bracketed Recall Algorithm leads to a 10% reduction in error rate.","{'title': '5 Experimental Results', 'number': '5'}"
"In addition, the performance of the Bracketed Recall Algorithm was also qualitatively more appealing.","{'title': '5 Experimental Results', 'number': '5'}"
Figure 2 shows typical results.,"{'title': '5 Experimental Results', 'number': '5'}"

The replication of the Pereira and Schabes experiment was useful for testing the Bracketed Recall Algorithm.,"{'title': '5 Experimental Results', 'number': '5'}"
"However, since that experiment induces a grammar with nonterminals not comparable to those in the training, a different experiment is needed to evaluate the Labelled Recall Algorithm, one in which the nonterminals in the induced grammar are the same as the nonterminals in the test set.","{'title': '5 Experimental Results', 'number': '5'}"
