We address in this article the problem of finding the word alignment of a bilingual sentence-aligned corpus by using language-independent statistical methods.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"There is a vast literature on this topic, and many different systems have been suggested to solve this problem.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Our work follows and extends the methods introduced by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) by using refined statistical models for the translation process.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The basic idea of this approach is to develop a model of the translation process with the word alignment as a hidden variable of this process, to apply statistical estimation theory to compute the “optimal” model parameters, and to perform alignment search to compute the best word alignment.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"So far, refined statistical alignment models have in general been rarely used.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"One reason for this is the high complexity of these models, which makes them difficult to understand, implement, and tune.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Instead, heuristic models are usually used.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In heuristic models, the word alignments are computed by analyzing some association score metric of a link between a source language word and a target language word.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
These models are relatively easy to implement.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In this article, we focus on consistent statistical alignment models suggested in the literature, but we also describe a heuristic association metric.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"By providing a detailed description and a systematic evaluation of these alignment models, we give the reader various criteria for deciding which model to use for a given task.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Example of a word alignment (VERBMOBIL task).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We propose to measure the quality of an alignment model by comparing the quality of the most probable alignment, the Viterbi alignment, with a manually produced reference alignment.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
This has the advantage of enabling an automatic evaluation to be performed.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition, we shall show that this quality measure is a precise and reliable evaluation criterion that is well suited to guide designing and training statistical alignment models.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The software used to train the statistical alignment models described in this article is publicly available (Och 2000).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We follow Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) to define alignment as an object for indicating the corresponding words in a parallel text.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Figure 1 shows an example.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Very often, it is difficult for a human to judge which words in a given target string correspond to which words in its source string.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Especially problematic is the alignment of words within idiomatic expressions, free translations, and missing function words.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The problem is that the notion of “correspondence” between words is subjective.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
It is important to keep this in mind in the evaluation of word alignment quality.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
We shall deal with this problem in Section 5.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The alignment between two word strings can be quite complicated.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Often, an alignment includes effects such as reorderings, omissions, insertions, and word-tophrase alignments.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Therefore, we need a very general representation of alignment.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Formally, we use the following definition for alignment in this article.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We are given a source (French) stringf1J = f1, ... , fj,.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
", fJ and a target language (English) string eI1 = e1,.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
", ei, ... , eI that have to be aligned.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We define an alignment between the two word strings as a subset of the Cartesian product of the word positions; that is, an Modeling the alignment as an arbitrary relation between source and target language positions is quite general.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The development of alignment models that are able to deal with this general representation, however, is hard.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Typically, the alignment models presented in the literature impose additional constraints on the alignment representation.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Typically, the alignment representation is restricted in a way such that each source word is assigned to exactly one target word.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Alignment models restricted in this way are similar to the concept of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in speech recognition.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The alignment mapping in such models consists of associations j → i = aj from source position j to target position i = aj.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The alignment aJ1 = a1, ... , aj, ... , aJ may contain alignments aj = 0 with the “empty” word e0 to account for source words that are not aligned with any target word.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Constructed in such a way, the alignment is not a relation between source and target language positions, but only a mapping from source to target language positions.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Melamed (2000), a further simplification is performed that enforces a one-to-one alignment for nonempty words.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
This means that the alignment mapping aJ1 must be injective for all word positions aj > 0.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Note that many translation phenomena cannot be handled using restricted alignment representations such as this one.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Especially, methods such as Melamed’s are in principle not able to achieve a 100% recall.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The problem can be reduced through corpus preprocessing steps that perform grouping and splitting of words.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Some papers report improvements in the alignment quality of statistical methods when linguistic knowledge is used (Ker and Chang 1997; Huang and Choi 2000).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In these methods, the linguistic knowledge is used mainly to filter out incorrect alignments.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In this work, we shall avoid making explicit assumptions concerning the language used.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"By avoiding these assumptions, we expect our approach to be applicable to almost every language pair.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The only assumptions we make are that the parallel text is segmented into aligned sentences and that the sentences are segmented into words.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Obviously, there are additional implicit assumptions in the models that are needed to obtain a good alignment quality.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, in languages with a very rich morphology, such as Finnish, a trivial segmentation produces a high number of words that occur only once, and every learning method suffers from a significant data sparseness problem.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
There are numerous applications for word alignments in natural language processing.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
These applications crucially depend on the quality of the word alignment (Och and Ney 2000; Yarowsky and Wicentowski 2000).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"An obvious application for word alignment methods is the automatic extraction of bilingual lexica and terminology from corpora (Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996; Melamed 2000).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Statistical alignment models are often the basis of single-word-based statistical machine translation systems (Berger et al. 1994; Wu 1996; Wang and Waibel 1998; Nießen et al.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"1998; Garc´ıa-Varea, Casacuberta, and Ney 1998; Och, Ueffing, and Ney 2001; Germann et al. 2001).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition, these models are the starting point for refined phrase-based statistical (Och and Weber 1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999) or example-based translation systems (Brown 1997).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In such systems, the quality of the machine translation output directly depends on the quality of the initial word alignment (Och and Ney 2000).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Another application of word alignments is in the field of word sense disambiguation (Diab 2000).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski (2001), word alignment is used to transfer text analysis tools such as morphologic analyzers or part-of-speech taggers from a language, such as English, for which many tools already exist to languages for which such resources are scarce.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 2, we review various statistical alignment models and heuristic models.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We present a new statistical alignment model, a log-linear combination of the best models of Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann (1996) and Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 3, we describe the training of the alignment models and present a new training schedule that yields significantly better results.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition, we describe how to deal with overfitting, deficient models, and very small or very large training corpora.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 4, we present some heuristic methods for improving alignment quality by performing a symmetrization of word alignments.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 5, we describe an evaluation methodology for word alignment methods dealing with the ambiguities associated with the word alignment annotation based on generalized precision and recall measures.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 6, we present a systematic comparison of the various statistical alignment models with regard to alignment quality and translation quality.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
We assess the effect of training corpora of various sizes and the use of a conventional bilingual dictionary.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In the literature, it is often claimed that the refined alignment models of Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) are not suitable for small corpora because of data sparseness problems.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
We show that this is not the case if these models are parametrized suitably.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In the Appendix, we describe some methods for efficient training of fertility-based alignment models.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
We distinguish between two general approaches to computing word alignments: statistical alignment models and heuristic models.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In the following, we describe both types of models and compare them from a theoretical viewpoint.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
The notational convention we employ is as follows.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
We use the symbol Pr(·) to denote general probability distributions with (almost) no specific assumptions.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In contrast, for model-based probability distributions, we use the generic symbol p(·).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
2.1.1 Statistical Alignment Models.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In statistical machine translation, we try to model the translation probability Pr(f1 J  |eI1), which describes the relationship between a source language string fJ1 and a target language string eI1.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In (statistical) alignment models Pr(fJ1,aJ1  |eI1), a “hidden” alignment aJ1 is introduced that describes a mapping from a source position j to a target position aj.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
The relationship between the translation model and the alignment model is given by The alignment aJ 1 may contain alignments aj = 0 with the empty word e0 to account for source words that are not aligned with any target word.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In general, the statistical model depends on a set of unknown parameters θ that is learned from training data.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"To express the dependence of the model on the parameter set, we use the following notation: The art of statistical modeling is to develop specific statistical models that capture the relevant properties of the considered problem domain.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In our case, the statistical alignment model has to describe the relationship between a source language string and a target language string adequately.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"To train the unknown parameters θ, we are given a parallel training corpus consisting of S sentence pairs {(fs, es) : s = 1, ... , S}.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"For each sentence pair (fs, es), the alignment variable is denoted by a = aJ1.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The unknown parameters θ are determined by maximizing the likelihood on the parallel training corpus: Typically, for the kinds of models we describe here, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) or some approximate EM algorithm is used to perform this maximization.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"To avoid a common misunderstanding, however, note that the use of the EM algorithm is not essential for the statistical approach, but only a useful tool for solving this parameter estimation problem.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Although for a given sentence pair there is a large number of alignments, we can always find a best alignment: The alignment ˆaJ1 is also called the Viterbi alignment of the sentence pair(f J 1,eI 1).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"(For the sake of simplicity, we shall drop the index θ if it is not explicitly needed.)","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Later in the article, we evaluate the quality of this Viterbi alignment by comparing it to a manually produced reference alignment.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The parameters of the statistical alignment models are optimized with respect to a maximum-likelihood criterion, which is not necessarily directly related to alignment quality.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Such an approach, however, requires training with manually defined alignments, which is not done in the research presented in this article.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
Experimental evidence shows (Section 6) that the statistical alignment models using this parameter estimation technique do indeed obtain a good alignment quality.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, we use Models 1 through 5 described in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the hidden Markov alignment model described in Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann (1996) and Och and Ney (2000), and a new alignment model, which we call Model 6.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"All these models use a different decomposition of the probability Pr(fJ1,aJ1  |eI1).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
2.1.2 Heuristic Models.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Considerably simpler methods for obtaining word alignments use a function of the similarity between the types of the two languages (Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996; Ker and Chang 1997; Melamed 2000).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Frequently, variations of the Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) are used as this similarity function.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"For each sentence pair, a matrix including the association scores between every word at every position is then obtained: C(e,f) denotes the co-occurrence count of e and f in the parallel training corpus.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"C(e) and C(f) denote the count of e in the target sentences and the count off in the source sentences, respectively.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"From this association score matrix, the word alignment is then obtained by applying suitable heuristics.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
One method is to choose as alignment aj = i for position j the word with the largest association score: A refinement of this method is the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed 2000).,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In a first step, the highest-ranking word position (i, j) is aligned.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Then, the corresponding row and column are removed from the association score matrix.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
This procedure is iteratively repeated until every source or target language word is aligned.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The advantage of this approach is that indirect associations (i.e., words that co-occur often but are not translations of each other) occur less often.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
The resulting alignment contains only one-to-one alignments and typically has a higher precision than the heuristic model defined in equation (7). tage of the heuristic models is their simplicity.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
They are very easy to implement and understand.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, variants of the heuristic models described above are widely used in the word alignment literature.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
One problem with heuristic models is that the use of a specific similarity function seems to be completely arbitrary.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The literature contains a large variety of different scoring functions, some including empirically adjusted parameters.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"As we show in Section 6, the Dice coefficient results in a worse alignment quality than the statistical models.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In our view, the approach of using statistical alignment models is more coherent.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The general principle for coming up with an association score between words results from statistical estimation theory, and the parameters of the models are adjusted such that the likelihood of the models on the training corpus is maximized.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
2.2.1 Hidden Markov Alignment Model.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The alignment model Pr(fJ1,aJ 1  |eI1) can be structured without loss of generality as follows: dependence for the alignments aj and that the lexicon probability depends only on the word at position aj: Later in the article, we describe a refinement with a dependence on eaj−1 in the alignment model.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Putting everything together and assuming a simple length model with the alignment probability p(i  |it, I) and the translation probability p(f  |e).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"To make the alignment parameters independent of absolute word positions, we assume that the alignment probabilities p(i  |i',I) depend only on the jump width (i − i').","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Using a set of non-negative parameters {c(i − i')}, we can write the alignment probabilities in the form This form ensures that the alignment probabilities satisfy the normalization constraint for each conditioning word position it, it = 1, ... , I.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"This model is also referred to as a homogeneous HMM (Vogel, Ney, and Tillmann 1996).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"A similar idea was suggested by Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In the original formulation of the hidden Markov alignment model, there is no empty word that generates source words having no directly aligned target word.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
We introduce the empty word by extending the HMM network by I empty words e2I I+1.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The target word ei has a corresponding empty word ei+I (i.e., the position of the empty word encodes the previously visited target word).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"We enforce the following constraints on the transitions in the HMM network (i ≤ I, it ≤ I) involving the empty word e0:1 The parameter p0 is the probability of a transition to the empty word, which has to be optimized on held-out data.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In our experiments, we set p0 = 0.2.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Whereas the HMM is based on first-order dependencies p(i = aj  |aj−1,I) for the alignment distribution, Models 1 and 2 use zero-order dependencies p(i = aj  |j, I, J): Hence, the word order does not affect the alignment probability.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"To reduce the number of alignment parameters, we ignore the dependence on J in the alignment model and use a distribution p(aj  |j, I) instead of p(aj  |j, I, J).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In the following, we give a short description of the fertility-based alignment models of Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
A gentle introduction can be found in Knight (1999b).,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The fertility-based alignment models (Models 3, 4, and 5) (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer 1993) have a significantly more complicated structure than the simple Models 1 and 2.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
The fertility Oi of a word ei in position i is defined as the number of aligned source words: The fertility-based alignment models contain a probability p(O  |e) that the target word e is aligned to O words.,"{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"By including this probability, it is possible to explicitly describe the fact that for instance the German word ¨ubermorgen produces four English words (the day after tomorrow).","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In particular, the fertility O = 0 is used for prepositions or articles that have no direct counterpart in the other language.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"To describe the fertility-based alignment models in more detail, we introduce, as an alternative alignment representation, the inverted alignments, which define a mapping from target to source positions rather than the other way around.","{'title': '2. Review of Alignment Models', 'number': '3'}"
"We allow several positions in the source language to be covered; that is, we consider alignments B of the form An important constraint for the inverted alignment is that all positions of the source sentence must be covered exactly once; that is, the Bi have to form a partition of the set {1, ... , j, ... ,J}.","{'title': '2.

Evaluating this sum by explicitly enumerating all alignments would be infeasible.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Fortunately, Models 1 and 2 and HMM have a particularly simple mathematical form such that the EM algorithm can be implemented efficiently (i.e., in the E-step, it is possible to efficiently evaluate all alignments).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"

This progressive increase in the number of words aligned with the empty word does not occur when the other alignment models are used.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
We believe that this is due to the deficiency of Model 3 and Model 4.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
The use of the EM algorithm guarantees that the likelihood increases for each iteration.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
This holds for both deficient and nondeficient models.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"For deficient models, however, as the amount of deficiency in the model is reduced, the likelihood increases.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"In Models 3 and 4 as defined in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the alignment model for nonempty words is deficient, but the alignment model for the empty word is nondeficient.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Hence, the EM algorithm can increase likelihood by simply aligning more and more words with the empty word.3 Therefore, we modify Models 3 and 4 slightly, such that the empty word also has a deficient alignment model.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"The alignment probability is set to p(j  |i, J) = 1/J for each source word aligned with the empty word.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Another remedy, adopted in Och and Ney (2000), is to choose a value for the parameter p1 of the empty-word fertility and keep it fixed.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"To overcome the problem of overfitting on the training data and to enable the models to cope better with rare words, we smooth the alignment and fertility probabilities.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"For the alignment probabilities of the HMM (and similarly for Models 4 and 5), we perform an interpolation with a uniform distribution p(i  |j,I) = 1/I using an interpolation parameter α: For the fertility probabilities, we assume that there is a dependence on the number of letters g(e) of e and estimate a fertility distribution p(φ  |g) using the EM algorithm.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Typically, longer words have a higher fertility.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"By making this assumption, the model can learn that the longer words usually have a higher fertility than shorter words.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Using an interpolation parameter β, the fertility distribution is then computed as � p'(φ  |e)β0 (e)) · p(φ  |e) + 0 (e) · p(φ  |g(e)) (38) Here, n(e) denotes the frequency of e in the training corpus.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"This linear interpolation ensures that for frequent words (i.e., n(e) » β), the specific distribution p(φ  |e) dominates, and that for rare words (i.e., n(e) « β), the general distribution p(φ  |g(e)) dominates.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
The interpolation parameters α and β are determined in such a way that the alignment quality on held-out data is optimized.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
A conventional bilingual dictionary can be considered an additional knowledge source that can be used in training.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"

"To integrate a dictionary into the EM algorithm, we compare two different methods: In this section, A(e) is an additional parameter describing the size of the sample that is used to estimate the model p(f  |e).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"This count is then used instead of N(e, f) in the EM algorithm as shown in equation (35).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"As a result, only dictionary entries that indeed occur in the training corpus have a large effect in training.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
The motivation behind this is to avoid a deterioration of the alignment as a result of out-of-domain dictionary entries.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
Every entry in the dictionary that does co-occur in the training corpus can be assumed correct and should therefore obtain a high count.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"

"In this section, we describe various methods for performing a symmetrization of our directed statistical alignment models by applying a heuristic postprocessing step that combines the alignments in both translation directions (source to target, target to source).","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
The baseline alignment model does not allow a source word to be aligned with more than one target word.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, lexical correspondences like that of the German compound word Zahnarzttermin with the English dentist’s appointment cause problems, because a single source word must be mapped to two or more target words.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, the resulting Viterbi alignment of the standard alignment models has a systematic loss in recall.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"To solve this problem, we perform training in both translation directions (source to target, target to source).","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"

"Let A1 = {(aj, j)  |aj > 01 and A2 = {(i, bi)  |bi > 01 denote the sets of alignments in the two Viterbi alignments.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"To increase the quality of the alignments, we combine A1 and A2 into one alignment matrix A using the following combination methods: determined.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
The elements of this intersection result from both Viterbi alignments and are therefore very reliable.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Then, we extend the alignment A iteratively by adding alignments (i, j) occurring only in the alignment A1 or in the alignment A2 if neither fj nor ei has an alignment in A, or if both of the following conditions hold: Obviously, the intersection of the two alignments yields an alignment consisting of only one-to-one alignments with a higher precision and a lower recall than either one separately.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
The union of the two alignments yields a higher recall and a lower precision of the combined alignment than either one separately.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
Whether a higher precision or a higher recall is preferred depends on the final application for which the word alignment is intended.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In applications such as statistical machine translation (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999), a higher recall is more important (Och and Ney 2000), so an alignment union would probably be chosen.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"

"In the following, we present an annotation scheme for single-word-based alignments and a corresponding evaluation criterion.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
It is well known that manually performing a word alignment is a complicated and ambiguous task (Melamed 1998).,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Therefore, in performing the alignments for the research presented here, we use an annotation scheme that explicitly allows for ambiguous alignments.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"The persons conducting the annotation are asked to specify alignments of two different kinds: an S (sure) alignment, for alignments that are unambiguous, and a P (possible) alignment, for ambiguous alignments.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
The P label is used especially to align words within idiomatic expressions and free translations and missing function words (S ⊆ P).,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
The reference alignment thus obtained may contain many-to-one and one-to-many relationships.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
Figure 2 shows an example of a manually aligned sentence with S and P labels.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"The quality of an alignment A = {(j, aj)  |aj > 0} is then computed by appropriately redefined precision and recall measures: and the following alignment error rate (AER), which is derived from the well-known F-measure: A manual alignment with S (filled squares) and P (unfilled squares) connections.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"These definitions of precision, recall and the AER are based on the assumption that a recall error can occur only if an S alignment is not found and a precision error can occur only if the found alignment is not even P. The set of sentence pairs for which the manual alignment is produced is randomly selected from the training corpus.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"It should be emphasized that all the training of the models is performed in a completely unsupervised way (i.e., no manual alignments are used).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"From this point of view, there is no need to have a test corpus separate from the training corpus.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Typically, the annotation is performed by two human annotators, producing sets S1, P1, S2, P2.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"To increase the quality of the resulting reference alignment, the annotators are presented with the mutual errors and asked to improve their alignments where possible.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
(Mutual errors of the two annotators A and B are the errors in the alignment of annotator A if we assume the alignment of annotator B as reference and the errors in the alignment of annotator B if we assume the alignment of annotator A as reference.),"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"From these alignments, we finally generate a reference alignment that contains only those S connections on which both annotators agree and all P connections from both annotators.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"This can be accomplished by forming the intersection of the sure alignments (S = S1∩S2) and the union of the possible alignments (P = P1∪P2), respectively.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"By generating the reference alignment in this way, we obtain an alignment error rate of 0 percent when we compare the S alignments of every single annotator with the combined reference alignment.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"

"For both tasks, we manually aligned a randomly chosen subset of the training corpus.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"

The sequence of models used and the number of training iterations used for each model is referred to in the following as the training scheme.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"

Tables 4 and 5 compare the alignment quality achieved using various models and training schemes.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"

"We see that the first iteration of Model 1 achieves significantly worse results than the Dice coefficient, but by only the second iteration, Model 1 gives better results than the Dice coefficient.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
An important result of these experiments is that the hidden Markov alignment model achieves significantly better results than Model 2.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"

"The method with a varying µ gives worse results, but this method has one fewer parameter to be optimized on held-out data.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"On small corpora, there is an improvement of up to 6.7% on the Verbmobil task and 3.2% on the Hansards task, but when a larger training corpus is used, the improvements are reduced to 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Interestingly, the amount of the overall improvement contributed by the use of a conventional dictionary is small compared to the improvement achieved through the use of better alignment models.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In this section, we compare the results obtained using different translation directions and using the symmetrization methods described in Section 4.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Tables 15 and 16 show precision, recall, and alignment error rate for the last iteration of Model 6 for both translation directions.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In this experiment, we use the conventional dictionary as well.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Particularly for the Verbmobil task, with the language pair German-English, we observe that for German as the source language the alignment error rate is much higher than for English as source language.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
A possible reason for this difference in the alignment error rates is that the baseline alignment representation as a vector aJ1 does not allow German word compounds (which occur frequently) to be aligned with more than one English word.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"The effect of merging alignments by forming the intersection, the union, or the refined combination of the Viterbi alignments in both translation directions is shown in Tables 17 and 18.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
Figure 5 shows the corresponding precision/recall graphs.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"By using the refined combination, we can increase precision and recall on the Hansards task.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
The lowest alignment error rate on the Hansards task is obtained by using the intersection method.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"By forming a union or intersection of the alignments, we can obtain very high recall or precision values on both the Hansards task and the Verbmobil task.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Alignment models similar to those studied in this article have been used as a starting point for refined phrase-based statistical machine translation systems (Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas 1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999; Ney et al. 2000).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In Och and Ney (2000), the overall result of the experimental evaluation has been that an improved alignment quality yields an improved subjective quality of the statistical machine translation system as well.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In this article, we have discussed in detail various statistical and heuristic word alignment models and described various modifications and extensions to models known in the literature.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
We have developed a new statistical alignment model (Model 6) that has yielded the best results among all the models we considered in the experiments we have conducted.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"We have presented two methods for including a conventional bilingual dictionary in training and described heuristic symmetrization algorithms that combine alignments in both translation directions possible between two languages, producing an alignment with a higher precision, a higher recall, or an improved alignment error rate.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
We have suggested measuring the quality of an alignment model using the quality of the Viterbi alignment compared to that achieved in a manually produced reference alignment.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
This quality measure has the advantage of automatic evaluation.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"To produce the reference alignment, we have used a refined annotation scheme that reduces the problems and ambiguities associated with the manual construction of a word alignment.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"We have performed various experiments to assess the effect of different alignment models, training schemes, and knowledge sources.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"The key results of these experiments are as follows: Further improvements in alignments are expected to be produced through the adoption of cognates (Simard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992) and from statistical alignment models based on word groups rather than single words (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999).","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
The use of models that explicitly deal with the hierarchical structures of natural language is very promising (Wu 1996; Yamada and Knight 2001).,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"We plan to develop structured models for the lexicon, alignment, and fertility probabilities using maximum-entropy models.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"This is expected to allow an easy integration of more dependencies, such as in a second-order alignment model, without running into the problem of the number of alignment parameters getting unmanageably large.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"Furthermore, it will be important to verify the applicability of the statistical alignment models examined in this article to less similar language pairs such as ChineseEnglish and Japanese-English.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"In this Appendix, we describe some methods for efficient training of fertility-based alignment models.","{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
The core idea is to enumerate only a small subset of good alignments in the E-step of the EM algorithm instead of enumerating all (I + 1)J alignments.,"{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
This small subset of alignments is the set of neighboring alignments of the best alignment that can be found by a greedy search algorithm.,"{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
"We use two operators to transform alignments: The move operator m[i,j](a) changes aj := i, and the swap operator s[j1,j2](a) exchanges aj1 and aj2.","{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
"The neighborhood N(a) of an alignment a is then defined as the set of all alignments that differ by one move or one swap from alignment a: For one step of the greedy search algorithm, we define the following hill-climbing operator (for Model 3), which yields for an alignment a the most probable alignment b(a) in the neighborhood N(a): Similarly, we define a hill-climbing operator for the other alignment models.","{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
"A straightforward count collection procedure for a sentence pair (f,e) following the description in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) is as follows:5 (d) Increase the counts for p1: A major part of the time in this procedure is spent on calculating the probability Pr(a'  |e, f) of an alignment a'.","{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
"In general, this takes about (I + J) operations.","{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
"Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) describe a method for obtaining Pr(a' | e, f) incrementally from Pr(a  |e, f) if alignment a differs only by moves or swaps from alignment a'.","{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
This method results in a constant number of operations that is sufficient to calculate the score of a move or the score of a swap.,"{'title': 'Appendix: Efficient Training of Fertility-Based Alignment Models', 'number': '9'}"
Analyzing the training program reveals that most of the time is spent on the computation of the costs of moves and swaps.,"{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"To reduce the number of operations required in such computation, these values are cached in two matrices.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"We use one matrix for the scores of a move aj := i: and an additional matrix for the scores of a swap of aj and aj�: During the hill climbing, it is sufficient, after making a move or a swap, to update only those rows or columns in the matrix that are affected by the move or swap.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"For example, when performing a move aj := i, it is necessary to Similar updates have to be performed after a swap.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"In the count collection (step 3), it is possible to use the same matrices as obtained in the last hill-climbing step.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"By restricting in this way the number of matrix entries that need to be updated, it is possible to reduce the number of operations in hill climbing by about one order of magnitude.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
The straightforward algorithm given for performing the count collection has the disadvantage of requiring that all alignments in the neighborhood of alignment a be enumerated explicitly.,"{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"In addition, it is necessary to perform a loop over all targets and a loop over all source positions to update the lexicon/alignment and the fertility counts.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"To perform the count collection in an efficient way, we use the fact that the alignments in the neighborhood N(a) are very similar.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
This allows the sharing of many operations in the count collection process.,"{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"To efficiently obtain the alignment and lexicon probability counts, we introduce the following auxiliary quantities that use the move and swap matrices that are available after performing the hill climbing described above: For the alignment counts c(j  |i; e, f) and the lexicon counts c(f  |e; e, f), we have To obtain the fertility probability counts and the count for p1 efficiently, we introduce the following auxiliary quantities: These quantities do not depend on swaps, since a swap does not change the fertilities of an alignment.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"For the fertility counts, we have: Using the auxiliary quantities, a count collection algorithm can be formulated that requires about O(max(I, J)2) operations.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
This is one order of magnitude faster than the straightforward algorithm described above.,"{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
"In practice, we observe that the resulting training is 10–20 times faster.","{'title': 'Refined Implementation: Fast Hill Climbing', 'number': '10'}"
