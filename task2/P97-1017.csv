It is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories.,{}
"These items are commonly transliterated, i.e., replaced with approximate phonetic equivalents. example, English comes out :/ — in Japanese.",{}
"Translating such items from Japanese back to English is even more challenging, and of practical interest, as transliterated items make up the bulk of text phrases not found in bilingual dictionaries.",{}
We describe and evaluate a method for performing backwards transliterations by machine.,{}
"This method uses a generative model, incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process.",{}
"Translators must deal with many problems, and one of the most frequent is translating proper names and technical terms.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For language pairs like Spanish/English, this presents no great challenge: a phrase like Antonio Gil usually gets translated as Antonio Gil.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, the situation is more complicated for language pairs that employ very different alphabets and sound systems, such as Japanese/English and Arabic/English.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Phonetic translation across these pairs is called transliteration.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Japanese frequently imports vocabulary from other languages, primarily (but not exclusively) from English.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"To write a word like golfbag in katakana, some compromises must be made.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, Japanese has no distinct L and Ft sounds: the two English sounds collapse onto the same Japanese sound.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A similar compromise must be struck for English II and F. Also, Japanese generally uses an alternating consonant-vowel structure, making it impossible to pronounce LFB without intervening vowels.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"For example, people rarely transliterate auxiliary verbs, but surnames are often transliterated.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"We have approximated such a model by removing high-frequency words like has, an, are, am, were, them, and does, plus unlikely words corresponding to Japanese sound bites, like coup and oh.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
We also built a separate word sequence model containing only English first and last names.,"{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"

The next WFST converts English word sequences into English sound sequences.,"{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"We use the English phoneme inventory from the online CMU Pronunciation Dictionary,3 minus the stress marks.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"

"We face two immediate problems: An obvious target inventory is the Japanese syllabary itself, written down in katakana (e.g., =-) or a roman equivalent (e.g., ni).","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"With this approach, the English sound K corresponds to one of t (ka), (ki), (ku), r (ke), or (ko), depending on its context.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Unfortunately, because katakana is a syllabary, we would be unable to express an obvious and useful generalization, namely that English K usually corresponds to Japanese k, independent of context.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Moreover, the correspondence of Japanese katakana writing to Japanese sound sequences is not perfectly one-to-one (see next section), so an independent sound inventory is well-motivated in any case.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Our Japanese sound inventory includes 39 symbols: 5 vowel sounds, 33 consonant sounds (including doubled consonants like kk), and one special symbol (pause).","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
An English sound sequence like (P R OW PAUSE S AA K ER) might map onto a Japanese sound sequence like (p u r o pause s a kk a a).,"{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"

"For each English/Japanese sequence pair, compute all possible alignments between their elements.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In our case, an alignment is a drawing that connects each English sound with one or more Japanese sounds, such that all Japanese sounds are covered and no lines cross.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, there are two ways to align the pair ( (L OW) <-> (r o o)): We then build a WFST directly from the symbolmapping probabilities: Our WFST has 99 states and 283 arcs.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"We have also built models that allow individual English sounds to be &quot;swallowed&quot; (i.e., produce zero Japanese sounds).","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
"However, these models are expensive to compute (many more alignments) and lead to a vast number of hypotheses during WFST composition.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"

"We combined corpus analysis with guidelines from a Japanese textbook (Jorden and Chaplin, 1976) to turn up many spelling variations and unusual katakana symbols: and so on.","{'title': '3 Probabilistic Models', 'number': '3'}"
