"Natural language parsing has typically been done with small sets of discrete categories such as NP and VP, but this representation does not capture the full syntactic nor semantic richness of linguistic phrases, and attempts to improve on this by lexicalizing phrases or splitting categories only partly address the problem at the cost of huge feature spaces and sparseness.",{}
"Instead, we introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG), which combines PCFGs with a syntactically untied recursive neural network that learns syntactico-semantic, compositional vector representations.",{}
The CVG improves the PCFG of the Stanford Parser by 3.8% to obtain an F1 score of 90.4%.,{}
It is fast to train and implemented approximately as an efficient reranker it is about 20% faster than the current Stanford factored parser.,{}
The CVG learns a soft notion of head words and improves performance on the types of ambiguities that require semantic information such as PP attachments.,{}
Syntactic parsing is a central task in natural language processing because of its importance in mediating between linguistic expression and meaning.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, much work has shown the usefulness of syntactic representations for subsequent tasks such as relation extraction, semantic role labeling (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) and paraphrase detection (Callison-Burch, 2008).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Syntactic descriptions standardly use coarse discrete categories such as NP for noun phrases or PP for prepositional phrases.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, recent work has shown that parsing results can be greatly improved by defining more fine-grained syntactic gory,vector) representations at each node.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The vectors for nonterminals are computed via a new type of recursive neural network which is conditioned on syntactic categories from a PCFG. categories, which better capture phrases with similar behavior, whether through manual feature engineering (Klein and Manning, 2003a) or automatic learning (Petrov et al., 2006).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, subdividing a category like NP into 30 or 60 subcategories can only provide a very limited representation of phrase meaning and semantic similarity.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Two strands of work therefore attempt to go further.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"First, recent work in discriminative parsing has shown gains from careful engineering of features (Taskar et al., 2004; Finkel et al., 2008).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Features in such parsers can be seen as defining effective dimensions of similarity between categories.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Second, lexicalized parsers (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 2000) associate each category with a lexical item.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This gives a fine-grained notion of semantic similarity, which is useful for tackling problems like ambiguous attachment decisions.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, this approach necessitates complex shrinkage estimation schemes to deal with the sparsity of observations of the lexicalized categories.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In many natural language systems, single words and n-grams are usefully described by their distributional similarities (Brown et al., 1992), among many others.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"But, even with large corpora, many n-grams will never be seen during training, especially when n is large.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In these cases, one cannot simply use distributional similarities to represent unseen phrases.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this work, we present a new solution to learn features and phrase representations even for very long, unseen n-grams.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar Parser (CVG) for structure prediction.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Like the above work on parsing, the model addresses the problem of representing phrases and categories.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

CVGs combine the advantages of standard probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG) with those of recursive neural networks (RNNs).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The former can capture the discrete categorization of phrases into NP or PP while the latter can capture fine-grained syntactic and compositional-semantic information on phrases and words.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This information can help in cases where syntactic ambiguity can only be resolved with semantic information, such as in the PP attachment of the two sentences: They ate udon with forks. vs.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
They ate udon with chicken.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Previous RNN-based parsers used the same (tied) weights at all nodes to compute the vector representing a constituent (Socher et al., 2011b).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This requires the composition function to be extremely powerful, since it has to combine phrases with different syntactic head words, and it is hard to optimize since the parameters form a very deep neural network.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We generalize the fully tied RNN to one with syntactically untied weights.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The weights at each node are conditionally dependent on the categories of the child constituents.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This allows different composition functions when combining different types of phrases and is shown to result in a large improvement in parsing accuracy.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Our compositional distributed representation allows a CVG parser to make accurate parsing decisions and capture similarities between phrases and sentences.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Any PCFG-based parser can be improved with an RNN.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We use a simplified version of the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003a) as the base PCFG and improve its accuracy from 86.56 to 90.44% labeled F1 on all sentences of the WSJ section 23.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The code of our parser is available at nlp.stanford.edu.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The CVG is inspired by two lines of research: Enriching PCFG parsers through more diverse sets of discrete states and recursive deep learning models that jointly learn classifiers and continuous feature representations for variable-sized inputs.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"As mentioned in the introduction, there are several approaches to improving discrete representations for parsing.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Klein and Manning (2003a) use manual feature engineering, while Petrov et al. (2006) use a learning algorithm that splits and merges the syntactic categories in order to maximize likelihood on the treebank.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Their approach splits categories into several dozen subcategories.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Another approach is lexicalized parsers (Collins, 2003; Charniak, 2000) that describe each category with a lexical item, usually the head word.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"More recently, Hall and Klein (2012) combine several such annotation schemes in a factored parser.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We extend the above ideas from discrete representations to richer continuous ones.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The CVG can be seen as factoring discrete and continuous parsing in one model.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Another different approach to the above generative models is to learn discriminative parsers using many well designed features (Taskar et al., 2004; Finkel et al., 2008).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We also borrow ideas from this line of research in that our parser combines the generative PCFG model with discriminatively learned RNNs.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Deep Learning and Recursive Deep Learning Early attempts at using neural networks to describe phrases include Elman (1991), who used recurrent neural networks to create representations of sentences from a simple toy grammar and to analyze the linguistic expressiveness of the resulting representations.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Words were represented as one-on vectors, which was feasible since the grammar only included a handful of words.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"

"However, their model is lacking in that it cannot represent the recursive structure inherent in natural language.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
They partially circumvent this problem by using either independent window-based classifiers or a convolutional layer.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"RNN-specific training was introduced by Goller and K¨uchler (1996) to learn distributed representations of given, structured objects such as logical terms.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"In contrast, our model both predicts the structure and its representation.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Henderson (2003) was the first to show that neural networks can be successfully used for large scale parsing.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
He introduced a left-corner parser to estimate the probabilities of parsing decisions conditioned on the parsing history.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The input to Henderson’s model consists of pairs of frequent words and their part-of-speech (POS) tags.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Both the original parsing system and its probabilistic interpretation (Titov and Henderson, 2007) learn features that represent the parsing history and do not provide a principled linguistic representation like our phrase representations.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"

CVGs build on two observations.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Firstly, that a lot of the structure and regularity in languages can be captured by well-designed syntactic patterns.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Hence, the CVG builds on top of a standard PCFG parser.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"However, many parsing decisions show fine-grained semantic factors at work.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore we combine syntactic and semantic information by giving the parser access to rich syntacticosemantic information in the form of distributional word vectors and compute compositional semantic vector representations for longer phrases (Costa et al., 2003; Menchetti et al., 2005; Socher et al., 2011b).","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The CVG model merges ideas from both generative models that assume discrete syntactic categories and discriminative models that are trained using continuous vectors.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"We will first briefly introduce single word vector representations and then describe the CVG objective function, tree scoring and inference.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"In most systems that use a vector representation for words, such vectors are based on cooccurrence statistics of each word and its context (Turney and Pantel, 2010).","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Another line of research to learn distributional word vectors is based on neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003) which jointly learn an embedding of words into an n-dimensional feature space and use these embeddings to predict how suitable a word is in its context.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"These vector representations capture interesting linear relationships (up to some accuracy), such as king−man+woman ≈ queen (Mikolov et al., 2013).","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
Collobert and Weston (2008) introduced a new model to compute such an embedding.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The idea is to construct a neural network that outputs high scores for windows that occur in a large unlabeled corpus and low scores for windows where one word is replaced by a random word.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
When such a network is optimized via gradient ascent the derivatives backpropagate into the word embedding matrix X.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
In order to predict correct scores the vectors in the matrix capture co-occurrence statistics.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"For further details and evaluations of these embeddings, see (Turian et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012).","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The resulting X matrix is used as follows.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"

"Now that we have discrete and continuous representations for all words, we can continue with the approach for computing tree structures and vectors for nonterminal nodes.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"The goal of supervised parsing is to learn a function g : X -+ Y, where X is the set of sentences and Y is the set of all possible labeled binary parse trees.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The set of all possible trees for a given sentence xi is defined as Y (xi) and the correct tree for a sentence is yi.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"We first define a structured margin loss A(yi, ˆy) for predicting a tree yˆ for a given correct tree.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"The loss increases the more incorrect the proposed parse tree is (Goodman, 1998).","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The discrepancy between trees is measured by counting the number of nodes N(y) with an incorrect span (or label) in the proposed tree: We set κ = 0.1 in all experiments.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"For a given set of training instances (xi, yi), we search for the function gθ, parameterized by θ, with the smallest expected loss on a new sentence.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
It has the following form: where the tree is found by the Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG) introduced below and then scored via the function s. The higher the score of a tree the more confident the algorithm is that its structure is correct.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"This max-margin, structureprediction objective (Taskar et al., 2004; Ratliff et al., 2007; Socher et al., 2011b) trains the CVG so that the highest scoring tree will be the correct tree: gθ(xi) = yi and its score will be larger up to a margin to other possible trees yˆ E Y(xi): s(CVG(θ, xi, yi)) >— s(CVG(θ, xi, ˆy)) + A(yi, ˆy).","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"

We begin by computing the activation for p1 using the children’s word vectors.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"We first concatenate the children’s representations b, c E Rnx1 into a E R2nx1.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
Then the composition function multiplies this vector by the parameter weights of the RNN W E Rnx2n and applies an element-wise nonlinearity function f = tanh to the output vector.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The resulting output p(1) is then given as input to compute p(2).,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
In order to compute a score of how plausible of a syntactic constituent a parent is the RNN uses a single-unit linear layer for all i: where v ∈ Rn is a vector of parameters that need to be trained.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
This score will be used to find the highest scoring tree.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"For more details on how standard RNNs can be used for parsing, see Socher et al. (2011b).","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"The standard RNN requires a single composition function to capture all types of compositions: adjectives and nouns, verbs and nouns, adverbs and adjectives, etc.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Even though this function is a powerful one, we find a single neural network weight matrix cannot fully capture the richness of compositionality.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Several extensions are possible: A two-layered RNN would provide more expressive power, however, it is much harder to train because the resulting neural network becomes very deep and suffers from vanishing gradient problems.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
Socher et al. (2012) proposed to give every single word a matrix and a vector.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The matrix is then applied to the sibling node’s vector during the composition.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"While this results in a powerful composition function that essentially depends on the words being combined, the number of model parameters explodes and the composition functions do not capture the syntactic commonalities between similar POS tags or syntactic categories.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Based on the above considerations, we propose the Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG) that conditions the composition function at each node on discrete syntactic categories extracted from a Figure 3: Example of a syntactically untied RNN in which the function to compute a parent vector depends on the syntactic categories of its children which we assume are given for now.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
PCFG.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"Hence, CVGs combine discrete, syntactic rule probabilities and continuous vector compositions.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The idea is that the syntactic categories of the children determine what composition function to use for computing the vector of their parents.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"While not perfect, a dedicated composition function for each rule RHS can well capture common composition processes such as adjective or adverb modification versus noun or clausal complementation.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"For instance, it could learn that an NP should be similar to its head noun and little influenced by a determiner, whereas in an adjective modification both words considerably determine the meaning of a phrase.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
"The original RNN is parameterized by a single weight matrix W. In contrast, the CVG uses a syntactically untied RNN (SU-RNN) which has a set of such weights.","{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"
The size of this set depends on the number of sibling category combinations in the PCFG.,"{'title': '3 Compositional Vector Grammars', 'number': '3'}"

"The base PCFG uses simplified categories of the Stanford PCFG Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003a).","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
We decreased the state splitting of the PCFG grammar (which helps both by making it less sparse and by reducing the number of parameters in the SU-RNN) by adding the following options to training: ‘-noRightRec dominatesV 0 -baseNP 0’.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
