In this paper we present an extension of a machine learning based coreference resolution system which uses features induced from different semantic knowledge sources.,{}
"These features represent knowledge mined from WordNet and Wikipedia, as well as information about semantic role labels.",{}
We show that semantic features indeed improve the performance on different referring expression types such as pronouns and common nouns.,{}
"The last years have seen a boost of work devoted to the development of machine learning based coreference resolution systems (Soon et al., 2001; Ng & Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004, inter alia).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"While machine learning has proved to yield performance rates fully competitive with rule based systems, current coreference resolution systems are mostly relying on rather shallow features, such as the distance between the coreferent expressions, string matching, and linguistic form.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, the literature emphasizes since the very beginning the relevance of world knowledge and inference for coreference resolution (Charniak, 1973).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This paper explores whether coreference resolution can benefit from semantic knowledge sources.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"More specifically, whether a machine learning based approach to coreference resolution can be improved and which phenomena are affected by such information.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We investigate the use of the WordNet and Wikipedia taxonomies for extracting semantic similarity and relatedness measures, as well as semantic parsing information in terms of semantic role labeling (Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002, SRL henceforth).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We believe that the lack of semantics in the current systems leads to a performance bottleneck.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In order to correctly identify the discourse entities which are referred to in a text, it seems essential to reason over the lexical semantic relations, as well as the event representations embedded in the text.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As an example, consider a fragment from the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) 2003 data.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In order to correctly resolve the anaphoric expressions highlighted in bold, it seems that some kind of lexical semantic and encyclopedic knowledge is required.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This includes that North Korea is a country, that countries consist of people and are societies.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The resolution requires an encyclopedia (i.e.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Wikipedia) look-up and reasoning on the content relatedness holding between the different expressions (i.e. as a path measure along the links of the WordNet and Wikipedia taxonomies).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Event representations seem also to be important for coreference resolution, as shown below: In this example, knowing that the Interfax news agency is the AGENT of the report predicate and It being the AGENT of say could trigger the (semantic parallelism based) inference required to correctly link the two expressions, in contrast to anchoring the pronoun to Moscow.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"SRL provides the semantic relationships that constituents have with predicates, thus allowing us to include such documentlevel event descriptive information into the relations holding between referring expressions (REs).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Instead of exploring different kinds of data representations, task definitions or machine learning techniques (Ng & Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004) we focus on a few promising semantic features which we evaluate in a controlled environment.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
That way we try to overcome the plateauing in performance in coreference resolution observed by Kehler et al. (2004).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Vieira & Poesio (2000), Harabagiu et al. (2001), and Markert & Nissim (2005) explore the use of WordNet for different coreference resolution subtasks, such as resolving bridging reference, otherand definite NP anaphora, and MUC-style coreference resolution.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
All of them present systems which infer coreference relations from a set of potential antecedents by means of a WordNet search.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Our approach to WordNet here is to cast the search results in terms of semantic similarity measures.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Their output can be used as features for a learner.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
These measures are not specifically developed for coreference resolution but simply taken ‘off-the-shelf’ and applied to our task without any specific tuning — i.e.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"in contrast to Harabagiu et al. (2001), who weight WordNet relations differently in order to compute the confidence measure of the path.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"To the best of our knowledge, we do not know of any previous work using Wikipedia or SRL for coreference resolution.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"In the case of SRL, this layer of semantic context abstracts from the specific lexical expressions used, and therefore represents a higher level of abstraction than (still related) work involving predicate argument statistics.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Kehler et al. (2004) observe no significant improvement due to predicate argument statistics.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The improvement reported by Yang et al. (2005) is rather caused by their twin-candidate model than by the semantic knowledge.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Employing SRL is closer in spirit to Ji et al. (2005), who explore the employment of the ACE 2004 relation ontology as a semantic filter.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"To establish a competitive coreference resolver, the system was initially prototyped using the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets (Chinchor & Sundheim, 2003; Chinchor, 2001), using the standard partitioning of 30 texts for training and 20-30 texts for testing.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"Then, we moved on and developed and tested the system with the ACE 2003 Training Data corpus (Mitchell et al., 2003)1.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"Both the Newswire (NWIRE) and Broadcast News (BNEWS) sections where split into 60-20-20% document-based partitions for training, development, and testing, and later per-partition merged (MERGED) for system evaluation.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
The distribution of coreference chains and referring expressions is given in Table 1.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"For learning coreference decisions, we used a Maximum Entropy (Berger et al., 1996) model.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"This was implemented using the MALLET library (McCallum, 2002).","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"To prevent the model from overfitting, we employed a tunable Gaussian prior as a smoothing method.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"The best parameter value is found by searching in the [0,10] interval with step value of 0.5 for the variance parameter yielding the highest MUC score F-measure on the development data.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"Coreference resolution is viewed as a binary classification task: given a pair of REs, the classifier has to decide whether they are coreferent or not.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"The MaxEnt model produces a probability for each category y (coreferent or not) of a candidate pair, conditioned on the context x in which the candidate occurs.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"The conditional probability is calculated by: where fi(x, y) is the value of feature i on outcome y in context x, and Ai is the weight associated with i in the model.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
Zx is a normalization constant.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"The features used in our model are all binary-valued feature functions (or indicator functions), e.g.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"In our system, a set of pre-processing components including a POS tagger (Gim´enez & M`arquez, 2004), NP chunker (Kudoh & Matsumoto, 2000) and the Alias-I LingPipe Named Entity Recognizer2 is applied to the text in order to identify the noun phrases, which are further taken as referring expressions (REs) to be used for instance generation.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, we use automatically extracted noun phrases, rather than assuming perfect NP chunking.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
This is in contrast to other related works in coreference resolution (e.g.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"

Instances are created following Soon et al. (2001).,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
We create a positive training instance from each pair of adjacent coreferent REs.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
Negative instances are obtained by pairing the anaphoric REs with any RE occurring between the anaphor and the antecedent.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"During testing each text is processed from left to right: each RE is paired with any preceding RE from right to left, until a pair labeled as coreferent is output, or the beginning of the document is reached.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
The classifier imposes a partitioning on the available REs by clustering each set of expressions labeled as coreferent into the same coreference chain.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"Following Ng & Cardie (2002), our baseline system reimplements the Soon et al. (2001) system.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
The system uses 12 features.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
Given a potential antecedent REi and a potential anaphor REQ the features are computed as follows3. those; else F. NUMBER T if both REi and REQ agree in number; else F. GENDER U if either REi or REQ have an undefined gender.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"

"We enrich the semantic information available to the classifier by using semantic similarity measures based on the WordNet taxonomy (Pedersen et al., 2004).","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"The measures we use include path length based measures (Rada et al., 1989; Wu & Palmer, 1994; Leacock & Chodorow, 1998), as well as ones based on information content (Resnik, 1995; Jiang & Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998).","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"In our case, the measures are obtained by computing the similarity scores between the head lemmata of each potential antecedent-anaphor pair.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"In order to overcome the sense disambiguation problem, we factorise over all possible sense pairs: given a candidate pair, we take the cross product of each antecedent and anaphor sense to form pairs of synsets.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"For each measure WN SIMILARITY, we compute the similarity score for all synset pairs, and create the following features.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"

"In addition, since May 2004 it provides also a taxonomy by means of the category feature: articles can be placed in one or more categories, which are further categorized to provide a category tree.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"In practice, the taxonomy is not designed as a strict hierarchy or tree of categories, but allows multiple categorisation schemes to co-exist simultaneously.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"Because each article can appear in more than one category, and each category can appear in more than one parent category, the categories do not form a tree structure, but a more general directed graph.","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"

The last semantic knowledge enhancement for the baseline system uses SRL information.,"{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"
"In our experiments we use the ASSERT parser (Pradhan et al., 2004), an SVM based semantic role tagger which uses a full syntactic analysis to automatically identify all verb predicates in a sentence together with their semantic arguments, which are output as PropBank arguments (Palmer et al., 2005).","{'title': '3 Coreference Resolution Using Semantic Knowledge Sources', 'number': '3'}"

"Future work will include turning Wikipedia into an ontology with well defined taxonomic relations, as well as exploring its usefulness of for other NLP applications.","{'title': '5 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '5'}"
"We believe that an interesting aspect of Wikipedia is that it offers large coverage resources for many languages, thus making it a natural choice for multilingual NLP systems.","{'title': '5 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '5'}"
Semantics plays indeed a role in coreference resolution.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '5'}"
But semantic features are expensive to compute and the development of efficient methods is required to embed them into large scale systems.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '5'}"
"Nevertheless, we believe that exploiting semantic knowledge in the manner we described will assist the research on coreference resolution to overcome the plateauing in performance observed by Kehler et al. (2004).","{'title': '5 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '5'}"
