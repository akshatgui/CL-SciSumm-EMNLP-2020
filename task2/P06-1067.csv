We propose a new distortion model that can be used with existing phrase-based SMT decoders to address those n-gram language model limitations.,{}
We present empirical results in Arabic to English Machine Translation that show statistically significant improvements when our proposed model is used.,{}

A language model is a statistical model that gives a probability distribution over possible sequences of words.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
It computes the probability of producing a given word w1 given all the words that precede it in the sentence.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"An n-gram language model is an n-th order Markov model where the probability of generating a given word depends only on the last n − 1 words immediately preceding it and is given by the following equation: where k >= n. N-gram language models have been successfully used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as was first proposed by (Bahl et al., 1983).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
They play an important role in selecting among several candidate word realization of a given acoustic signal.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"N-gram language models have also been used in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) as proposed by (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The run-time search procedure used to find the most likely translation (or transcription in the case of Speech Recognition) is typically referred to as decoding.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
There is a fundamental difference between decoding for machine translation and decoding for speech recognition.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"When decoding a speech signal, words are generated in the same order in which their corresponding acoustic signal is consumed.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, that is not necessarily the case in MT due to the fact that different languages have different word order requirements.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, in Spanish and Arabic adjectives are mainly noun post-modifiers, whereas in English adjectives are noun pre-modifiers.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Therefore, when translating between Spanish and English, words must usually be reordered.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Existing statistical machine translation decoders have mostly relied on language models to select the proper word order among many possible choices when translating between two languages.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we argue that a language model is not sufficient to adequately address this issue, especially when translating between languages that have very different word orders as suggested by our experimental results in Section 5.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We propose a new distortion model that can be used as an additional component in SMT decoders.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This new model leads to significant improvements in MT quality as measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The experimental results we report in this paper are for Arabic-English machine translation of news stories.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Section 2 presents a review of related work.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
In Section 3 we propose a method for measuring the distortion between any given pair of languages.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 4, we present our proposed distortion model.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 5, we present some empirical results that show the utility of our distortion model for statistical machine translation systems.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Then, we conclude this paper with a discussion in Section 6.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Different languages have different word order requirements.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
SMT decoders attempt to generate translations in the proper word order by attempting many possible word reorderings during the translation process.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Trying all possible word reordering is an NP-Complete problem as shown in (Knight, 1999), which makes searching for the optimal solution among all possible permutations computationally intractable.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Therefore, SMT decoders typically limit the number of permutations considered for efficiency reasons by placing reordering restrictions.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Reordering restrictions for word-based SMT decoders were introduced by (Berger et al., 1996) and (Wu, 1996).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Berger et al., 1996) allow only reordering of at most n words at any given time.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Wu, 1996) propose using contiguity restrictions on the reordering.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"For a comparison and a more detailed discussion of the two approaches see (Zens and Ney, 2003).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
A different approach to allow for a limited reordering is to reorder the input sentence such that the source and the target sentences have similar word order and then proceed to monotonically decode the reordered source sentence.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Monotone decoding translates words in the same order they appear in the source language.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Hence, the input and output sentences have the same word order.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Monotone decoding is very efficient since the optimal decoding can be found in polynomial time.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Tillmann et al., 1997) proposed a DP-based monotone search algorithm for SMT.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Their proposed solution to address the necessary word reordering is to rewrite the input sentence such that it has a similar word order to the desired target sentence.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The paper suggests that reordering the input reduces the translation error rate.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"However, it does not provide a methodology on how to perform this reordering.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Xia and McCord, 2004) propose a method to automatically acquire rewrite patterns that can be applied to any given input sentence so that the rewritten source and target sentences have similar word order.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
These rewrite patterns are automatically extracted by parsing the source and target sides of the training parallel corpus.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Their approach show a statistically-significant improvement over a phrase-based monotone decoder.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Their experiments also suggest that allowing the decoder to consider some word order permutations in addition to the rewrite patterns already applied to the source sentence actually decreases the BLEU score.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Rewriting the input sentence whether using syntactic rules or heuristics makes hard decisions that can not be undone by the decoder.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Hence, reordering is better handled during the search algorithm and as part of the optimization function.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Phrase-based monotone decoding does not directly address word order issues.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Indirectly, however, the phrase dictionary1 in phrase-based decoders typically captures local reorderings that were seen in the training data.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"However, it fails to generalize to word reorderings that were never seen in the training data.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, a phrase-based decoder might translate the Arabic phrase AlwlAyAt AlmtHdp2 correctly into English as the United States if it was seen in its training data, was aligned correctly, and was added to the phrase dictionary.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"However, if the phrase Almmlkp AlmtHdp is not in the phrase dictionary, it will not be translated correctly by a monotone phrase decoder even if the individual units of the phrase Almmlkp and AlmtHdp, and their translations (Kingdom and United, respectively) are in the phrase dictionary since that would require swapping the order of the two words.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Och et al., 1999; Tillmann and Ney, 2003) relax the monotonicity restriction in their phrase-based decoder by allowing a restricted set of word reorderings.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"For their translation task, word reordering is done only for words belonging to the verb group.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The context in which they report their results is a Speech-to-Speech translation from German to English.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Yamada and Knight, 2002) propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
They reported results that are better than word-based IBM4-like decoder.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"However, their decoder is outperformed by phrase-based decoders such as (Koehn, 2004), (Och et al., 1999), and (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) .","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Phrase-based SMT decoders mostly rely on the language model to select among possible word order choices.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"However, in our experiments we show that the language model is not reliable enough to make the choices that lead to a better MT quality.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"This observation is also reported by (Xia and McCord, 2004).We argue that the distortion model we propose leads to a better translation as measured by BLEU.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Distortion models were first proposed by (Brown et al., 1993) in the so-called IBM Models.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"IBM Models 2 and 3 define the distortion parameters in terms of the word positions in the sentence pair, not the actual words at those positions.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Distortion probability is also conditioned on the source and target sentence lengths.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
These models do not generalize well since their parameters are tied to absolute word position within sentences which tend to be different for the same words across sentences.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
IBM Models 4 and 5 alleviate this limitation by replacing absolute word positions with relative positions.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The latter models define the distortion parameters for a cept (one or more words).,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
This models phrasal movement better since words tend to move in blocks and not independently.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The distortion is conditioned on classes of the aligned source and target words.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"The entire source and target vocabularies are reduced to a small number of classes (e.g., 50) for the purpose of estimating those parameters.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Similarly, (Koehn et al., 2003) propose a relative distortion model to be used with a phrase decoder.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The model is defined in terms of the difference between the position of the current phrase and the position of the previous phrase in the source sentence.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
It does not conillustrate word positions in the sentence.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The indices in the reordered English denote word position in the original English order. sider the words in those positions.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The distortion model we propose assigns a probability distribution over possible relative jumps conditioned on source words.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Conditioning on the source words allows for a much more fine-grained model.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"For instance, words that tend to act as modifers (e.g., adjectives) would have a different distribution than verbs or nouns.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Our model’s parameters are directly estimated from word alignments as we will further explain in Section 4.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We will also show how to generalize this word distortion model to a phrase-based model.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Och et al., 2004; Tillman, 2004) propose orientation-based distortion models lexicalized on the phrase level.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
There are two important distinctions between their models and ours.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"First, they lexicalize their model on the phrases, which have many more parameters and hence would require much more data to estimate reliably.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Second, their models consider only the direction (i.e., orientation) and not the relative jump.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We are not aware of any work on measuring word order differences between a given language pair in the context of statistical machine translation.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"In this section, we propose a simple, novel method for measuring word order similarity (or differences) between any given language pair.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
This method is based on word-alignments and the BLEU metric.,"{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
We assume that we have word-alignments for a set of sentence pairs.,"{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"We first reorder words in the target sentence (e.g., English when translating from Arabic to English) according to the order in which they are aligned to the source words as shown in Table 1.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"If a target word is not aligned, then, we assume that it is aligned to the same source word that the preceding aligned target word is aligned to.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"Once the reordered target (here English) sentences are generated, we measure the distortion between the language pair by computing the BLEU3 score between the original target and reordered target, treating the original target as the reference.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
Table 2 shows these scores for Arabic-English and 3the BLEU scores reported throughout this paper are for case-sensitive BLEU.,"{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"The number of references used is also reported (e.g., BLEUr1n4c: r1 means 1 reference, n4 means upto 4-gram are considred, c means case sensitive).","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"

The ArabicEnglish test set is the NIST MT Evaluation 2003 test set.,"{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"It contains 663 segments (i.e., sentences).","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"The Arabic side consists of 16,652 tokens and the English consists of 19,908 tokens.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
The Chinese-English test set contains 260 segments.,"{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"The Chinese side is word segmented and consists of 4,319 tokens and the English consists of 5,525 tokens.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"As suggested by the BLEU scores reported in Table 2, Arabic-English has more word order differences than Chinese-English.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"The difference in n-gPrec is bigger for smaller values of n, which suggests that ArabicEnglish has more local word order differences than in Chinese-English.","{'title': '3 Measuring Word Order Similarity Between Two Language', 'number': '3'}"
"The distortion model we are proposing consists of three components: outbound, inbound, and pair distortion.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
Intuitively our distortion models attempt to capture the order in which source words need to be translated.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"For instance, the outbound distortion component attempts to capture what is typically translated immediately after the word that has just been translated.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
Do we tend to translate words that precede it or succeed it?,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
Which word position to translate next?,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
Our distortion parameters are directly estimated from word alignments by simple counting over alignment links in the training data.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"Any aligner such as (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999) or (Vogel et al., 1996) can be used to obtain word alignments.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"For the results reported in this paper word alignments were obtained using a maximum-posterior word aligner4 described in (Ge, 2004).","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
We will illustrate the components of our model with a partial word alignment.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"Let us assume that our source sentences is (f10, f250 )6, and our target sentence is (e410, e20), and their word alignment is a = ((f10, e410), (f300, e20)).","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"Word Alignment a can be rewritten as a1 = 1 and a2 = 3 (i.e., the second target word is aligned to the third source word).","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"From this partial alignment we increase the counts for the following outbound, inbound, and pair distortions: Po(δ = +2|f10), Pi(δ = +2|f300). and Pp(δ = +2|f10, f300).","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"Formally, our distortion model components are defined as follows: where fi is a foreign word (i.e., Arabic in our case), δ is the step size, and C(δ|fi) is the observed count of this parameter over all word alignments in the training data.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"The value for δ, in theory, ranges from −max to +max (where max is the maximum source sentence length observed), but in practice only a small number of those step sizes are observed in the training data, and hence, have non-zero value).","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"In order to use these probability distributions in our decoder, they are then turned into costs.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
The outbound distortion cost is defined as: where P3(δ) is a smoothing distribution 7 and α is a linear-mixture parameter 8.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"The inbound and pair costs (Ci(δ|fi) and Cp(δ|fi, fj)) can be defined in a similar fashion.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"So far, our distortion cost is defined in terms of words, not phrases.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"Therefore, we need to generalize the distortion cost in order to use it in a phrasebased decoder.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
This generalization is defined in terms of the internal word alignment within phrases (we used the Viterbi word alignment).,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
We illustrate this with an example: Suppose the last position translated in the source sentence so far is n and we are to cover a source phrase p=wlAyp wA$nTn that begins at position m in the source sentence.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"Also, suppose that our phrase dictionary provided the translation Washington State, with internal word alignment a = (a1 = 2, a2 = 1) (i.e., a=(<Washington,wA$nTn>, <State,wlAyp>), then the outbound phrase cost is defined as: where l is the length of the target phrase, a is the internal word alignment, fn is source word at position n (in the sentence), and fa, is the source word that is aligned to the i-th word in the target side of the phrase (not the sentence).","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
"The inbound and pair distortion costs (i..e, Ci(p, n, m, a) and Cp(p, n, m, a)) can be defined in a similar fashion.","{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"
The above distortion costs are used in conjunction with other cost components used in our decoder.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Distortion Model', 'number': '4'}"

We also propose a novel metric to measure word order similarity (or differences) between any pair of languages based on word alignments.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Our metric shows that Chinese-English have a closer word order than Arabic-English.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Our proposed distortion model relies solely on word alignments and is conditioned on the source words.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
The majority of word movement in translation is mainly due to syntactic differences between the source and target language.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, Arabic is verb-initial for the most part.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"So, when translating into English, one needs to move the verb after the subject, which is often a long compounded phrase.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"Therefore, we would like to incorporate syntactic or part-of-speech information in our distortion model.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
