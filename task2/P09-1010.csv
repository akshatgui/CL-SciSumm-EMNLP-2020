"Grounded Language Acquisition Our work fits into a broader class of approaches that aim to learn language from a situated context (Mooney, 2008a; Mooney, 2008b; Fleischman and Roy, 2005; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Siskind, 2001; Oates, 2001).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"

The reinforcement learning state space encodes information about the goals of the user and what they say at each time step.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"The learning problem is to find an optimal policy that maps states to actions, through a trial-and-error process of repeated interaction with the user.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Reinforcement learning is applied very differently in dialogue systems compared to our setup.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"In some respects, our task is more easily amenable to reinforcement learning.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"For instance, we are not interacting with a human user, so the cost of interaction is lower.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"However, while the state space can be designed to be relatively small in the dialogue management task, our state space is determined by the underlying environment and is typically quite large.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We address this complexity by developing a policy gradient algorithm that learns efficiently while exploring a small subset of the states.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Our task is to learn a mapping between documents and the sequence of actions they express.,"{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
Figure 2 shows how one example sentence is mapped to three actions.,"{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"Mapping Text to Actions As input, we are given a document d, comprising a sequence of sentences (u1, ... , ut), where each ui is a sequence of words.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"Our goal is to map d to a sequence of actions a� = (a0, ... , a,1).","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"Actions are predicted and executed sequentially.2 An action a = (c, R, W') encompasses a command c, the command’s parameters R, and the words W' specifying c and R. Elements of R refer to objects available in the environment state, as described below.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"Some parameters can also refer to words in document d. Additionally, to account for words that do not describe any actions, c can be a null command.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"The Environment The environment state £ specifies the set of objects available for interaction, and their properties.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"In Figure 2, £ is shown on the right.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"The environment state £ changes in response to the execution of command c with parameters R according to a transition distribution p(£'J£, c, R).","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
This distribution is a priori unknown to the learner.,"{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"As we will see in Section 5, our approach avoids having to directly estimate this distribution.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"State To predict actions sequentially, we need to track the state of the document-to-actions mapping over time.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"A mapping state s is a tuple (£, d, j, W), where £ refers to the current environment state; j is the index of the sentence currently being interpreted in document d; and W contains words that were mapped by previous actions for the same sentence.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
The mapping state s is observed after each action.,"{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"The initial mapping state s0 for document d is (£d, d, 0, 0); £d is the unique starting environment state for d. Performing action a in state s = (£, d, j, W) leads to a new state s' according to distribution p(s'|s, a), defined as follows: £ transitions according to p(£'|£, c, R), W is updated with a’s selected words, and j is incremented if all words of the sentence have been mapped.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"For the applications we consider in this work, environment state transitions, and consequently mapping state transitions, are deterministic.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"Training During training, we are provided with a set D of documents, the ability to sample from the transition distribution, and a reward function r(h).","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"Here, h = (s0, a0, ... , sn−1, an−1, sn) is a history of states and actions visited while interpreting one document. r(h) outputs a realvalued score that correlates with correct action selection.3 We consider both immediate reward, which is available after each action, and delayed reward, which does not provide feedback until the last action.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, task completion is a delayed reward that produces a positive value after the final action only if the task was completed successfully.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
We will also demonstrate how manually annotated action sequences can be incorporated into the reward.,"{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"The goal of training is to estimate parameters 0 of the action selection distribution p(a|s, 0), called the policy.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
"Since the reward correlates with action sequence correctness, the 0 that maximizes expected reward will yield the best actions.","{'title': '3 Problem Formulation', 'number': '3'}"
Our goal is to predict a sequence of actions.,"{'title': '4 A Log-Linear Model for Actions', 'number': '4'}"
"We construct this sequence by repeatedly choosing an action given the current mapping state, and applying that action to advance to a new state.","{'title': '4 A Log-Linear Model for Actions', 'number': '4'}"
"Given a state s = (£, d, j, W), the space of possible next actions is defined by enumerating subspans of unused words in the current sentence (i.e., subspans of the jth sentence of d not in W), and the possible commands and parameters in environment state £.4 We model the policy distribution p(a|s; 0) over this action space in a log-linear fashion (Della Pietra et al., 1997; Lafferty et al., 2001), giving us the flexibility to incorporate a diverse range of features.","{'title': '4 A Log-Linear Model for Actions', 'number': '4'}"

"During training, our goal is to find the optimal policy p(a|s; θ).","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Since reward correlates with correct action selection, a natural objective is to maximize expected future reward — that is, the reward we expect while acting according to that policy from state s. Formally, we maximize the value function: where the history h is the sequence of states and actions encountered while interpreting a single document d E D. This expectation is averaged over all documents in D. The distribution p(h|θ) returns the probability of seeing history h when starting from state s and acting according to a policy with parameters θ.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"This distribution can be decomposed into a product over time steps: Input: A document set D, Feature representation φ, Reward function r(h), Number of iterations T Our reinforcement learning problem is to find the parameters θ that maximize Vθ from equation 2.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Although there is no closed form solution, policy gradient algorithms (Sutton et al., 2000) estimate the parameters θ by performing stochastic gradient ascent.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"The gradient of Vθ is approximated by interacting with the environment, and the resulting reward is used to update the estimate of θ.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
Policy gradient algorithms optimize a non-convex objective and are only guaranteed to find a local optimum.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"However, as we will see, they scale to large state spaces and can perform well in practice.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"To find the parameters θ that maximize the objective, we first compute the derivative of Vθ.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Expanding according to the product rule, we have: where the inner sum is over all time steps t in the current history h. Expanding the inner partial derivative we observe that: which is the derivative of a log-linear distribution.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
Equation 5 is easy to compute directly.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"However, the complete derivative of Vθ in equation 4 is intractable, because computing the expectation would require summing over all possible histories.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Instead, policy gradient algorithms employ stochastic gradient ascent by computing a noisy estimate of the expectation using just a subset of the histories.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Specifically, we draw samples from p(h|θ) by acting in the target environment, and use these samples to approximate the expectation in equation 4.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"In practice, it is often sufficient to sample a single history h for this approximation.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
Algorithm 1 details the complete policy gradient algorithm.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
It performs T iterations over the set of documents D. Step 3 samples a history that maps each document to actions.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"This is done by repeatedly selecting actions according to the current policy, and updating the state by executing the selected actions.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
Steps 4 and 5 compute the empirical gradient and update the parameters θ.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"In many domains, interacting with the environment is expensive.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, we use two techniques that allow us to take maximum advantage of each environment interaction.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"First, a history h = (s0, a0, ... , sn) contains subsequences (si, ai,... sn) for i = 1 to n − 1, each with its own reward value given by the environment as a side effect of executing h. We apply the update from equation 5 for each subsequence.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Second, for a sampled history h, we can propose alternative histories h' that result in the same commands and parameters with different word spans.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"We can again apply equation 5 for each h', weighted by its probability under the current policy, p(h�|θ) The algorithm we have presented belongs to a family of policy gradient algorithms that have been successfully used for complex tasks such as robot control (Ng et al., 2003).","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
Our formulation is unique in how it represents natural language in the reinforcement learning framework.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"We can design a range of reward functions to guide learning, depending on the availability of annotated data and environment feedback.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Consider the case when every training document d E D is annotated with its correct sequence of actions, and state transitions are deterministic.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Given these examples, it is straightforward to construct a reward function that connects policy gradient to maximum likelihood.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Specifically, define a reward function r(h) that returns one when h matches the annotation for the document being analyzed, and zero otherwise.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Policy gradient performs stochastic gradient ascent on the objective from equation 2, performing one update per document.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"For document d, this objective becomes: where hd is the history corresponding to the annotated action sequence.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, with this reward policy gradient is equivalent to stochastic gradient ascent with a maximum likelihood objective.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"At the other extreme, when annotations are completely unavailable, learning is still possible given informative feedback from the environment.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"Crucially, this feedback only needs to correlate with action sequence quality.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
We detail environment-based reward functions in the next section.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"As our results will show, reward functions built using this kind of feedback can provide strong guidance for learning.","{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
We will also consider reward functions that combine annotated supervision with environment feedback.,"{'title': '5 Reinforcement Learning', 'number': '5'}"
"We study two applications of our model: following instructions to perform software tasks, and solving a puzzle game using tutorial guides.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"

"Possible commands include left-click, right-click, double-click, and type-into, all of which take a UI object as a parameter; type-into additionally requires a parameter for the input text.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
Table 1 lists some of the features we use for this domain.,"{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"These features capture various aspects of the action under consideration, the current Windows UI state, and the input instructions.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, one lexical feature measures the similarity of a word in the sentence to the UI labels of objects in the environment.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"Environment-specific features, such as whether an object is currently in focus, are useful when selecting the object to manipulate.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"In total, there are 4,438 features.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
Reward Function Environment feedback can be used as a reward function in this domain.,"{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"An obvious reward would be task completion (e.g., whether the stated computer problem was fixed).","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"Unfortunately, verifying task completion is a challenging system issue in its own right.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"Instead, we rely on a noisy method of checking whether execution can proceed from one sentence to the next: at least one word in each sentence has to correspond to an object in the environment.6 For instance, in the sentence from Figure 2 the word “Run” matches the Run... menu item.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"If no words in a sentence match a current environment object, then one of the previous sentences was analyzed incorrectly.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"In this case, we assign the history a reward of -1.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"This reward is not guaranteed to penalize all incorrect histories, because there may be false positive matches between the sentence and the environment.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"When at least one word matches, we assign a positive reward that linearly increases with the percentage of words assigned to non-null commands, and linearly decreases with the number of output actions.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"

"The challenge in this domain is to segment the text into the phrases describing each action, and then correctly identify the line segments from references such as “the bottom four from the second column from the left.” For this domain, we use two sets of binary features on state-action pairs (s, a).","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"First, for each vocabulary word w, we define a feature that is one if w is the last word of a’s consumed words W'.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
These features help identify the proper text segmentation points between actions.,"{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"
"Second, we introduce features for pairs of vocabulary word w and attributes of action a, e.g., the line orientation and grid locations of the squares that a would remove.","{'title': '6 Applying the Model', 'number': '6'}"

Baselines We consider the following baselines to characterize the performance of our approach. lems like ours are typically addressed using supervised techniques.,"{'title': '7 Experimental Setup', 'number': '7'}"

The performance of the fully supervised approach provides further evidence that the task is challenging.,"{'title': '8 Results', 'number': '8'}"
