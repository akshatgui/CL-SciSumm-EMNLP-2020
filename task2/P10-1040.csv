It is preferable to use a simple and general method to adapt existing supervised NLP systems to be semi-supervised.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"One approach that is becoming popular is to use unsupervised methods to induce word features—or to download word features that have already been induced—plug these word features into an existing system, and observe a significant increase in accuracy.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
But which word features are good for what tasks?,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Should we prefer certain word features?,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Can we combine them?,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A word representation is a mathematical object associated with each word, often a vector.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Each dimension’s value corresponds to a feature and might even have a semantic or grammatical interpretation, so we call it a word feature.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Conventionally, supervised lexicalized NLP approaches take a word and convert it to a symbolic ID, which is then transformed into a feature vector using a one-hot representation: The feature vector has the same length as the size of the vocabulary, and only one dimension is on.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, the one-hot representation of a word suffers from data sparsity: Namely, for words that are rare in the labeled training data, their corresponding model parameters will be poorly estimated.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Moreover, at test time, the model cannot handle words that do not appear in the labeled training data.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
These limitations of one-hot word representations have prompted researchers to investigate unsupervised methods for inducing word representations over large unlabeled corpora.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Word features can be hand-designed, but our goal is to learn them.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"One common approach to inducing unsupervised word representation is to use clustering, perhaps hierarchical.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This technique was used by a variety of researchers (Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005; Koo et al., 2008; Ratinov & Roth, 2009; Huang & Yates, 2009).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This leads to a one-hot representation over a smaller vocabulary size.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Neural language models (Bengio et al., 2001; Schwenk & Gauvain, 2002; Mnih & Hinton, 2007; Collobert & Weston, 2008), on the other hand, induce dense real-valued low-dimensional word embeddings using unsupervised approaches.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Distributional word representations are based upon a cooccurrence matrix F of size WxC, where W is the vocabulary size, each row Fw is the initial representation of word w, and each column Fc is some context.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"Sahlgren (2006) and Turney and Pantel (2010) describe a handful of possible design decisions in contructing F, including choice of context types (left window? right window? size of window?) and type of frequency count (raw? binary? tf-idf?).","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"Fw has dimensionality W, which can be too large to use Fw as features for word w in a supervised model.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"One can map F to matrix f of size W x d, where d << C, using some function g, where f = g(F). fw represents word w as a vector with d dimensions.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"The choice of g is another design decision, although perhaps not as important as the statistics used to initially construct F. The self-organizing semantic map (Ritter & Kohonen, 1989) is a distributional technique that maps words to two dimensions, such that syntactically and semantically related words are nearby (Honkela et al., 1995; Honkela, 1997).","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"LSA (Dumais et al., 1988; Landauer et al., 1998), LSI, and LDA (Blei et al., 2003) induce distributional representations over F in which each column is a document context.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"In most of the other approaches discussed, the columns represent word contexts.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"

"ICA is another technique to transform F into f. (V¨ayrynen & Honkela, 2004; V¨ayrynen & Honkela, 2005; V¨ayrynen et al., 2007).","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"ICA is expensive, and the largest vocabulary size used in these works was only 10K.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"As far as we know, ICA methods have not been used when the size of the vocab W is 100K or more.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"Explicitly storing cooccurrence matrix F can be memory-intensive, and transforming F to f can be time-consuming.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"It is preferable that F never be computed explicitly, and that f be constructed incrementally.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"

This is similar in magnitude to our experiments.,"{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
Another incremental approach to constructing f is using a random projection: Linear mapping g is multiplying F by a random matrix chosen a priori.,"{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"This random indexing method is motivated by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which states that for certain choices of random matrix, if d is sufficiently large, then the original distances between words in F will be preserved in f (Sahlgren, 2005).","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
Kaski (1998) uses this technique to produce 100-dimensional representations of documents.,"{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
Sahlgren (2001) was the first author to use random indexing using narrow context.,"{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"Sahlgren (2006) does a battery of experiments exploring different design decisions involved in constructing F, prior to using random indexing.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"However, like all the works cited above, Sahlgren (2006) only uses distributional representation to improve existing systems for one-shot classification tasks, such as IR, WSD, semantic knowledge tests, and text categorization.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
It is not well-understood what settings are appropriate to induce distributional word representations for structured prediction tasks (like parsing and MT) and sequence labeling tasks (like chunking and NER).,"{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"
"Previous research has achieved repeated successes on these tasks using clustering representations (Section 3) and distributed representations (Section 4), so we focus on these representations in our work.","{'title': '2 Distributional representations', 'number': '2'}"

Clustering methods and distributional methods can overlap.,"{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, Pereira et al. (1993) begin with a cooccurrence matrix and transform this matrix into a clustering.","{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"
"The Brown algorithm is a hierarchical clustering algorithm which clusters words to maximize the mutual information of bigrams (Brown et al., 1992).","{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"
So it is a class-based bigram language model.,"{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"
"It runs in time O(V·K2), where V is the size of the vocabulary and K is the number of clusters.","{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"
"The hierarchical nature of the clustering means that we can choose the word class at several levels in the hierarchy, which can compensate for poor clusters of a small number of words.","{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"
"One downside of Brown clustering is that it is based solely on bigram statistics, and does not consider word usage in a wider context.","{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"
"Brown clusters have been used successfully in a variety of NLP applications: NER (Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005; Ratinov & Roth, 2009), PCFG parsing (Candito & Crabb´e, 2009), dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009), and semantic dependency parsing (Zhao et al., 2009).","{'title': '3 Clustering-based word representations', 'number': '3'}"

"A distributed representation is compact, in the sense that it can represent an exponential number of clusters in the number of dimensions.","{'title': '4 Distributed representations', 'number': '4'}"
"Word embeddings are typically induced using neural language models, which use neural networks as the underlying predictive model (Bengio, 2008).","{'title': '4 Distributed representations', 'number': '4'}"

"However, many approaches have been proposed in recent years to eliminate that linear dependency on vocabulary size (Morin & Bengio, 2005; Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009) and allow scaling to very large training corpora.","{'title': '4 Distributed representations', 'number': '4'}"

"We also create a corrupted or noise n-gram x˜ = (w1, ... , wn_q, ˜wn), where ˜wn # wn is chosen uniformly from the vocabulary.1 For convenience, we write e(x) to mean e(w1) ® ... ® e(wn).","{'title': '4 Distributed representations', 'number': '4'}"
We predict a score s(x) for x by passing e(x) through a single hidden layer neural network.,"{'title': '4 Distributed representations', 'number': '4'}"

"One of the difficulties in inducing these embeddings is that there is no stopping criterion defined, and that the quality of the embeddings can keep improving as training continues.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
Collobert (p.c.) simply leaves one computer training his embeddings indefinitely.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

"In comparison to Turian et al. (2009), we use improved C&W embeddings in this work: formly in the range [-0.01, +0.01], not [-1,+1].","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"For rare words, which are typically updated only 143 times per epoch2, and given that our embedding learning rate was typically 1e-6 or 1e-7, this means that rare word embeddings will be concentrated around zero, instead of spread out randomly.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"The HLBL embeddings were trained for 100 epochs (7 days).3 Unlike our Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, we did not extensively tune the learning rates for HLBL.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
We used a learning rate of 1e-3 for both model parameters and embedding parameters.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

"Embeddings were induced over one pass approach using a random tree, not two passes with an updated tree and embeddings re-estimation.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Like many NLP systems, the baseline system contains only binary features.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"The word embeddings, however, are real numbers that are not necessarily in a bounded range.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

"There are capacity controls for the word representations: number of Brown clusters, and number of dimensions of the word embeddings.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

"We would like to induce 10000 Brown clusters, however this would take several months.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"In Turian et al. (2009), we hypothesized on the basis of solely the HLBL NER curve that higher-dimensional word embeddings would give higher accuracy.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
Figure 2 shows that this hypothesis is not true.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"For NER, the C&W curve is almost flat, and we were suprised to find the even 25-dimensional C&W word embeddings work so well.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

Tables 2 and 3 show that accuracy can be increased further by combining the features from different types of word representations.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"But, if only one word representation is to be used, Brown clusters have the highest accuracy.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Given the improvements to the C&W embeddings since Turian et al. (2009), C&W embeddings outperform the HLBL embeddings.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

Combining representations leads to small increases in the test F1.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"In comparison to chunking, combining different word representations on NER seems gives larger improvements on the test F1.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"On NER, Brown clusters are superior to the word embeddings.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Since much of the NER F1 is derived from decisions made over rare words, we suspected that Brown clustering has a superior representation for rare words.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Brown makes a single hard clustering decision, whereas the embedding for a rare word is close to its initial value since it hasn’t received many training updates (see Footnote 2).","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Figure 3 shows the total number of per-token errors incurred on the test set, depending upon the frequency of the word token in the unlabeled data.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"For NER, Figure 3 (b) shows that most errors occur on rare words, and that Brown clusters do indeed incur fewer errors for rare words.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"This supports our hypothesis that, for rare words, Brown clustering produces better representations than word embeddings that haven’t received sufficient training updates.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"For chunking, Brown clusters and C&W embeddings incur almost identical numbers of errors, and errors are concentrated around the more common words.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"We hypothesize that non-rare words have good representations, regardless of the choice of word representation technique.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"For tasks like chunking in which a syntactic decision relies upon looking at several token simultaneously, compound features that use the word representations might increase accuracy more (Koo et al., 2008).","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
Using word representations in NER brought larger gains on the out-of-domain data than on the in-domain data.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"We were surprised by this result, because the OOD data was not even used during the unsupervised word representation induction, as was the in-domain data.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

Ando and Zhang (2005) present a semisupervised learning algorithm called alternating structure optimization (ASO).,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
They find a lowdimensional projection of the input features that gives good linear classifiers over auxiliary tasks.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"These auxiliary tasks are sometimes specific to the supervised task, and sometimes general language modeling tasks like “predict the missing word”.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"

"(In Suzuki et al. (2009), they extend their semi-supervised approach to more general conditional models.)","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
One of the advantages of the semi-supervised learning approach that we use is that it is simpler and more general than that of Ando and Zhang (2005) and Suzuki and Isozaki (2008).,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Their methods dictate a particular choice of model and training regime and could not, for instance, be used with an NLP system based upon an SVM classifier.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Lin and Wu (2009) present a K-means-like non-hierarchical clustering algorithm for phrases, which uses MapReduce.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Since they can scale to millions of phrases, and they train over 800B unlabeled words, they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on NER using their phrase clusters.","{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
This suggests that extending word representations to phrase representations is worth further investigation.,"{'title': '7 Experiments and Results', 'number': '7'}"
"Word features can be learned in advance in an unsupervised, task-inspecific, and model-agnostic manner.","{'title': '8 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
"These word features, once learned, are easily disseminated with other researchers, and easily integrated into existing supervised NLP systems.","{'title': '8 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
"The disadvantage, however, is that accuracy might not be as high as a semi-supervised method that includes task-specific information and that jointly learns the supervised and unsupervised tasks (Ando & Zhang, 2005; Suzuki & Isozaki, 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009).","{'title': '8 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
"Unsupervised word representations have been used in previous NLP work, and have demonstrated improvements in generalization accuracy on a variety of tasks.","{'title': '8 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
Ours is the first work to systematically compare different word representations in a controlled way.,"{'title': '8 Conclusions', 'number': '8'}"
