"We describe an approach to two areas of biomedical information extraction, drug development and cancer genomics.",{}
"We have developed a framework which includes corpus annotation integrated at multiple levels: a Treebank containing syntactic structure, a Propbank containing predicate-argument structure, and annotation of entities and relations among the entities.",{}
"Crucial to this approach is the proper characterization of entities as relation components, which allows the integration of the entity annotation with the syntactic structure while retaining the capacity to annotate and extract more complex events.",{}
We are training statistical taggers using this annotation for such extraction as well as using them for improving the annotation process.,{}
"Work over the last few years in literature data mining for biology has progressed from linguistically unsophisticated models to the adaptation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that use full parsers (Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001) and coreference to extract relations that span multiple sentences (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Hahn et al., 2002) (For an overview, see (Hirschman et al., 2002)).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this work we describe an approach to two areas of biomedical information extraction, drug development and cancer genomics, that is based on developing a corpus that integrates different levels of semantic and syntactic annotation.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This corpus will be a resource for training machine learning algorithms useful for information extraction and retrieval and other datamining applications.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We are currently annotating only abstracts, although in the future we plan to expand this to full-text articles.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We also plan to make publicly available the corpus and associated statistical taggers.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We are collaborating with researchers in the Division of Oncology at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, with the goal of automatically mining the corpus of cancer literature for those associations that link specified variations in individual genes with known malignancies.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In particular we are interested in extracting three entities (Gene, Variation Event, and Malignancy) in the following relationship: Gene X with genomic Variation Event Y is correlated with Malignancy Z.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, WT1 is deleted in Wilms Tumor #S. Such statements found in the literature represent individual gene-variation-malignancy observables.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
A collection of such observables serves two important functions.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"First, it summarizes known relationships between genes, variation events, and malignancies in the cancer literature.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As such, it can be used to augment information available from curated public databases, as well as serve as an independent test for accuracy and completeness of such repositories.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Second, it allows inferences to be made about gene, variation, and malignancy associations that may not be explicitly stated in the literature, both at the fact and entity instance levels.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Such inferences provide testable hypotheses and thus future research targets.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The other major area of focus, in collaboration with researchers in the Knowledge Integration and Discovery Systems group at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), is the extraction of information about enzymes, focusing initially on compounds that affect the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of proteins.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, the goal is to see a phrase like Amiodarone weakly inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4-mediated activities with Ki values of 45.1–271.6 and extract the facts amiodarone inhibits CYP2C9 with Ki=45.1-271.6 amiodarone inhibits CYP2D6 with Ki=45.1-271.6 amiodarone inhibits CYP3A4 with Ki=45.1-271.6 Previous work at GSK has used search algorithms that are based on pattern matching rules filling template slots.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The rules rely on identifying the relevant passages by first identifying compound names and then associating them with a limited number of relational terms such as inhibit or inactivate.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This is similar to other work in biomedical extraction projects (Hirschman et al., 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Creating good pattern-action rules for an IE problem is far from simple.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"There are many complexities in the different ways that a relation can be expressed in language, such as syntactic alternations and the heavy use of coordination.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"While sufficiently complex patterns can deal with these issues, it requires a good amount of time and effort to build such hand-crafted rules, particularly since such rules are developed for each specific problem.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
A corpus that is annotated with sufficient syntactic and semantic structure offers the promise of training taggers for quicker and easier information extraction.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The corpus that we are developing for the two different application demands consists of three levels of annotation: the entities and relations among the entities for the oncology or CYP domain, syntactic structure (Treebank), and predicate-argument structure (Propbank).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This is a novel approach from the point-of-view of NLP since previous efforts at Treebanking and Propbanking have been independent of the special status of any entities, and previous efforts at entity annotation have been independent of corresponding layers of syntactic and semantic structure.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The decomposition of larger entities into components of a relation, worthwhile by itself on conceptual grounds for entity definition, also allows the component entities to be mapped to the syntactic structure.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"These entities can be viewed as semantic types associated with syntactic constituents, and so our expectation is that automated analyses of these related levels will interact in a mutually reinforcing and beneficial way for development of statistical taggers.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Development of such statistical taggers is proceeding in parallel with the annotation effort, and these taggers help in the annotation process, as well as being steps towards automatic extraction.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper we focus on the aspects of this project that have been developed and are in production, while also trying to give enough of the overall vision to place the work that has been done in context.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Section 2 discusses some of the main issues around the development of the guidelines for entity annotation, for both the oncology and inhibition domains.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Section 3 first discusses the overall plan for the different levels of annotation, and then focuses on the integration of the two levels currently in production, entity annotation and syntactic structure.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Section 4 describes the flow of the annotation process, including the development of the statistical taggers mentioned above.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Section 5 is the conclusion.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Annotation has been proceeding for both the oncology and the inhibition domains.,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
Here we give a summary of the main features of the annotation guidelines that have been developed.,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"We have been influenced in this by previous work in annotation for biomedical information extraction (Ohta et al., 2002; Gaizauskas et al., 2003).","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"However, we differ in the domains we are annotating and the design philosophy for the entity guidelines.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, we have been concentrating on explicit concepts for entities like genes rather than developing a wide-range ontology for the various physical instantiations.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
Gene Entity For the sake of this project the definition for ”Gene Entity” has two significant characteristics.,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"First, ”Gene” refers to a composite entity as opposed to the strict biological definition.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"As has been noted by others, there are often ambiguities in the usage of the entity names.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, it is sometimes unclear as to whether it is the gene or protein being referenced, or the same name might refer to the gene or the protein at different locations in the same document.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Our approach to this problem is influenced by the named entity annotation in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) project (Consortium, 2002), in which “geopolitical” entities can have different roles, such as “location” or “organization”.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Analogously, we consider a “gene” to be a composite entity that can have different roles throughout a document.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Standardization of ”Gene” references between different texts and between gene synonyms is handled by externally referencing each instance to a standard ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000).","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"In the context of this project, ”Gene” refers to a conceptual entity as opposed to the specific manifestation of a gene (i.e. an allele or nucleotide sequence).","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Therefore, we consider genes to be abstract concepts identifying genomic regions often associated with a function, such as MYC or TrkB; we do not consider actual instances of such genes within the gene-entity domain.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Since we are interested in the association between Gene-entities and malignancies, for this project genes are of interest to us when they have an associated variation event.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Therefore, the combination of Gene entities and Variation events provides us with an evoked entity representing the specific instance of a gene.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Variation Events as Relations Variations comprise a relationship between the following entities: Type (e.g. point mutation, translocation, or inversion), Location (e.g. codon 14, 1p36.1, or base pair 278), Original-State (e.g.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Alanine), and Altered-State (e.g.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
Thymine).,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
These four components represent the key elements necessary to describe any genomic variation event.,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Variations are often underspecified in the literature, frequently having only two or three of these specifications.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Characterizing individual variations as a relation among such components provides us with a great deal of flexibility: 1) it allows us to capture the complete variation event even when specific components are broadly spaced in the text, often spanning multiple sentences or even paragraphs; 2) it provides us with a convenient means of tracking anaphora between detailed descriptions (e.g. a point mutation at codon 14 and summary references (e.g. this variation); and 3) it provides a single structure capable of capturing the breadth of variation specifications (e.g.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"A- T point mutation at base pair 47, A48- G or t(11;14)(q13;32)).","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
Malignancy The guidelines for malignancy annotation are under development.,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"We are planning to define it in a manner analogous to variation, whereby a Malignancy is composed of various attribute types (such as developmental stage, behavior, topographic site, and morphology).","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
In the CYP Inhibition annotation task we are tagging three types of entities: Each category has its own questions and uncertainties.,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Names like CYP2C19 and cytochrome P450 enzymes proclaim their membership, but there are many aliases and synonyms that do not proclaim themselves, such as 17,20-lyase.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
We are compiling a list of such names.,"{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Other substances is a potentially huge and vaguelydelimited set, which in the current corpus includes grapefruit juice and red wine as well as more obviously biochemical entities like polyunsaturatedfatty acids and erythromycin.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"The quantitative measurements we are directly interested in are those directly related to inhibition, such as IC50 and K(i).","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"We tag the name of the measurement, the numerical value, and the unit.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, in the phrase ...was inhibited by troleandomycin (ED50 = 1 microM), ED50 is the name, 1 the value, and microM the unit.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"We are also tagging other measurements, since it is easy to do and may provide valuable information for future IE work.","{'title': '2 Guidelines for Entity Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"As has been noted in the literature on biomedical IE (e.g., (Pustejovsky et al., 2002; Yakushiji et al., 2001)), the same relation can take a number of syntactic forms.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the family of words based on inhibit occurs commonly in MEDLINE abstracts about CYP enzymes (as in the example in the introduction) in patterns like A inhibited B, A inhibited the catalytic activity of B, inhibition of B by A, etc.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
Such alternations have led to the use of patternmatching rules (often hand-written) to match all the relevant configurations and fill in template slots based on the resulting pattern matches.,"{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"As discussed in the introduction, dealing with such complications in patterns can take much time and effort.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Our approach instead is to build an annotated corpus in which the predicate-argument information is annotated on top of the parsing annotations in the Treebank, the resulting corpus being called a “proposition bank” or Propbank.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
This newly annotated corpus is then used for training processors that will automatically extract such structures from new examples.,"{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"In a Propbank for biomedical text, the types of inhibit examples listed above would consistently have their compounds labeled as Arg0 and their enzymes labeled as Arg1, for nominalized forms such as A is an inhibitor of B, A caused inhibition of B, inhibition of B by A, as well the standard A inhibits B.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"We would also be able to label adjuncts consistently, such as the with prepositional phrase in CYP3A4 activity was decreased by L, S and F with IC(50) values of about 200 mM.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"In accordance with other Calibratable verbs such as rise, fall, decline, etc., this phrase would be labeled as an Arg2-EXTENT, regardless of its syntactic role.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"A Propbank has been built on top of the Penn Treebank, and has been used to train “semantic taggers”, for extracting argument roles for the predicates of interest, regardless of the particular syntactic context.1 Such semantic taggers have been developed by using machine learning techniques trained on the Penn Propbank (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"However, the Penn Treebank and Propbank involve the annotation of Wall Street Journal text.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"This text, being a financial domain, differs in significant ways from the biomedical text, and so it is necessary for this approach to have a corpus of biomedical texts such as MEDLINE articles annotated for both syntactic structure (Treebanking) and shallow semantic structure (Propbanking).","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"In this project, the syntactic and semantic annotation is being done on a corpus which is also being annotated for entities, as described in Section 2.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Since semantic taggers of the sort described above result in semantic roles assigned to syntactic tree constituents, it is desirable to have the entities correspond to syntactic constituents so that the semantic roles are assigned to entities.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
The entity information can function as type information and be taken advantage of by learning algorithms to help characterize the properties of the terms filling specified roles in a given predicate.,"{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"This integration of these three different annotation levels, including the entities, is being done for the first time2, and we discuss here three main challenges to this correspondence between entities and constituents: (1) entities that are large enough to cut across multiple constituents, (2) entities within prenominal modifiers, and (3) coordination.3 Relations and Large Entities One major area of concern is the possibility of entities that contain more than one syntactic constituent and do not match any node in the syntax tree.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, as discussed in Section 2, a variation event includes material on a variation’s type, location, and state, and can cut not only across constituents, but even sentences and paragraphs.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"A simple example is point mutations at codon 12, containing both the nominal (the type of mutation) and following NP (the location).","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that while in isolation this could also be considered one syntactic constituent, the NP and PP together, the actual context is ...point mutations at codon 12 in duodenal lavage fluid....","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Since all PPs are attached at the same level, at codon 12 and in duodenal lavage fluid are sisters, and so there is no constituent consisting ofjust point mutations at codon 12.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Casting the variation event as a relation between different component entities allows the component entities to correspond to tree constituents, while retaining the capacity to annotate and search for more complex events.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"In this case, one component entity point mutations cor2An influential precursor to this integration is the system described in (Miller et al., 1996).","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Our work is in much the same spirit, although the representation of the predicate-argument structure via Propbank and the linkage to the entities is quite different, as well as of course the domain of annotation.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"3There are cases where the entities are so minimal that they are contained within a NP, not including the determiner, such as CpG site in the NP a CpG site. entities.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"We are not as concerned about these cases since we expect that such entity information properly contained within a base NP can be associated with the full base NP. responds to a (base) NP node, and at codon 12 is corresponds to the PP node that is the NP’s sister.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"At the same time, the relation annotation contains the information relating these two constituents.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Similarly, while the malignancy entity definition is currently under development, as mentioned in Section 2.1, a guiding principle is that it will also be treated as a relation and broken down into component entities.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"While this also has conceptual benefits for the annotation guidelines, it has the fortunate effect of making such otherwise syntaxunfriendly malignancies as colorectal adenomas containing early cancer and acute myelomonocytic leukemia in remission amenable for mapping the component parts to syntactic nodes.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Entities within Prenominal Modifiers While we are for the most part following the Penn Treebank guidelines (Bies et al., 1995), we are modifying them in two important aspects.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"One concerns the prenominal modifiers, which in the Penn Treebank were left flat, with no structure, but in this biomedical domain contain much of the information - e.g., cancer-associated autoimmune antigen.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Not only would this have had no annotation for structure, but even more bizarrely, cancer-associated would have been a single token in the Penn Treebank, thus making it impossible to capture the information as to what is associated with what.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"We have developed new guidelines to assign structure to prenominal entities such as breast cancer, as well as changed the tokenization guidelines to break up tokens such as cancer-associated.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Coordination We have also modified the treebank annotation to account for the well-known problem of entities that are discontinuous within a coordination structure - e.g., K- and H-ras, where the entities are K-ras and Hras.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Our annotation tool allows for discontinuous entities, so that both K-ras and H-ras are annotated as genes.","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
"Under standard Penn Treebank guidelines for tokenization and syntactic structure, this would receive the flat structure","{'title': '3 Integrated Annotation', 'number': '3'}"
K- and H-ras in which there is no way to directly associate the entity K-ras with a constituent node.,"{'title': 'NP', 'number': '4'}"
"We have modified the treebank guidelines so that K-ras and H-ras are both constituents, with the ras part ofK-ras represented with an empty category co-indexed with ras in H-ras:4.","{'title': 'NP', 'number': '4'}"
"As mentioned in the introduction, statistical taggers are being developed in parallel with the annotation effort.","{'title': 'NP', 'number': '4'}"
"While such taggers are part of the final goal of the project, providing the building blocks for extracting entities and relations, they are also useful in the annotation process itself, so that the annotators only need to perform correction of automatically tagged data, instead of starting from scratch.","{'title': 'NP', 'number': '4'}"
We are currently annotating MEDLINE abstracts for both the oncology and CYP domains.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
The flowchart for the annotation process is shown in Figure 1.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Tokenization, POS-tagging, entity annotation (both domains), and treebanking are in full production.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
Propbank annotation and the merging of the entities and treebanking remain to be integrated into the current workflow.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
The table in Figure 2 shows the number of abstracts completed for each annotation area.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
The annotation sequence begins with tokenization and part-of-speech annotating.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"While both aspects are similar to those used for the Penn Treebank, there are some differences, partly alluded to in Section 3.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Tokens are somewhat more fine-grained than in the Penn Treebank, so that H-ras, e.g., would consist of three tokens: H, -, and ras.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Tokenized and part-of-speech annotated files are then sent to the entity annotators, either for oncology or CYP, depending on which domain the abstract has been chosen for.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
The entities described in Section 2 are annotated at this step.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"We are using WordFreak, a Java-based linguistic annotation tool5, for annotation of tokenization, POS, and entities.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Figure 3 is a screen shot of the oncology domain annotation, here showing a variation relation being created out of component entities for type and location.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"In parallel with the entity annotation, a file is treebanked - i.e., annotated for its syntactic structure.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
Note that this is done independently of the entity annotation.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"This is because the treebanking guidelines are relatively stable (once they were adjusted for the biomedical domain as described in Section 3), while the entity definitions can require a significant period of study before stabilizing, and with the parallel treatment the treebanking can proceed without waiting for the entity annotation.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"However, this does mean that to produce the desired integrated annotation, the entity and treebanking annotations need to be merged into one representation.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
The consideration of the issues described in Section 3 has been carried out for the purpose of allowing this integration of the treebanking and entity annotation.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"This has been completed for some pilot documents, but the full merging remains to be integrated into the workflow system.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Until recently (Feb. 10), the part-of-speech annotation was done by hand-correcting the results of tagging the data with a part-of-speech tagger trained on a modified form of the Penn Treebank.6 The tagger is a maximumentropy model utilizing the opennlp package available athttp://www.sf.net/projects/opennlp.It has now been retrained using 315 files (122 from the oncology domain, 193 from the cyp domain).","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
Figure 4 shows the improvement of the new vs. the old POS tagger on the same 294 files that have been hand-corrected.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"These results are based on testing files that have already been tokenized, and thus are an evaluation only of the POS tagger and not the tokenizer.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"While not directly comparable to results such as (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), due to the different tag sets and tokenization, they are in the same general range.7 The oncology and cyp entity annotation, as well as the treebanking are still being done fully manually, although that will change in the near future.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Initial results for a tagger to identify the various components of a variation relation are promising, although not yet integrated into annotation process.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"The tagger is based on the implementation of Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) in the Mallet toolkit (McCallum, 2002).","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Briefly, Conditional Random Fields are log-linear models that rely on weighted features to make predictions on the input.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
Features used by our system include standard pattern matching and word features as well as some expert-created regular expression features8.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"Using 10-fold cross-validation on 264 labelled abstracts containing 551 types, 1064 locations and 557 states, we obtained the following results: An entity is considered correctly identified if and only if it matches the human labeling by both category (type, location or state) and span (from position a to position b).","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
At this stage we have not distinguished between initial and final states.,"{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
"While it is difficult to compare taggers that tag different types of entities (e.g., (Friedman et al., 2001; Gaizauskas et al., 2003)), CRFs have been utilized for state-of-the-art results in NP-chunking and gene and protein tagging (Sha and Pereira, 2003; McDonald and Pereira, 2004) Currently, we are beginning to investigate methods to identify relations over the variation components that are extracted using the entity tagger.","{'title': '4 Annotation Process', 'number': '5'}"
