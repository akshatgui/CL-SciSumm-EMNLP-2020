One problem that has posed an impediment to more wide-spread acceptance of dependency grammars is the fact that there is no computationally tractable version of dependency grammar which is not restricted to projective analyses.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"The parse is complete if there is an entry (m, qm, 0) in square M(n, 1) of the parse matrix, where in is a C-rule-FSM for a start category and qm is a final state of M. If we keep backpointers at each step in the algorithm, we have a compact representation of the parse forest.","{'title': '5 A Polynomial Parser for PP-GDG', 'number': '5'}"
"The maximum number of entries in each square of the parse matrix is 0(GQ4), where G is the number of rule-FSMs corresponding to LP rules in the grammar, Q is the maximum number of states in any of the rule-FSMs, and L is the maximum number of states that the lifting rules can be in (i.e., the number of lifting conditions in the grammar multiplied by the maximum number of dot positions of any lifting condition).","{'title': '5 A Polynomial Parser for PP-GDG', 'number': '5'}"
"Note that the exponent is a grammar constant, but this number can be rather small since the lifting rules are not lexicalized - they are construction-specific, not lexemespecific.","{'title': '5 A Polynomial Parser for PP-GDG', 'number': '5'}"
The time complexity of the algorithm is therefore 0(GQn3+2ILI).,"{'title': '5 A Polynomial Parser for PP-GDG', 'number': '5'}"
