We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences.,{}
For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments.,{}
We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments.,{}
"Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences.",{}

"The growing availability of bilingual, machine-readable texts has stimulated interest in methods for extracting linguistically valuable information from such texts.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, a number of recent papers deal with the problem of automatically obtaining pairs of aligned sentences from parallel corpora (Warwick and Russell 1990; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991b; Kay 1991).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Brown et al. (1990) assert, and Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) and Gale and Church (1991b) both show, that it is possible to obtain such aligned pairs of sentences without inspecting the words that the sentences contain.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Brown, Lai, and Mercer base their algorithm on the number of words that the sentences contain, while Gale and Church base a similar algorithm on the number of characters that the sentences contain.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The lesson to be learned from these two efforts is that simple, statistical methods can be surprisingly successful in achieving linguistically interesting goals.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Here, we address a natural extension of that work: matching up the words within pairs of aligned sentences.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In recent papers, Brown et al. (1988, 1990) propose a statistical approach to machine translation from French to English.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In the latter of these papers, they sketch an algorithm for estimating the probability that an English word will be translated into any particular French word and show that such probabilities, once estimated, can be used together with a statistical model of the translation process to align the words in an English sentence with the words in its French translation (see their Figure 3).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Pairs of sentences with words aligned in this way offer a valuable resource for work in bilingual lexicography and machine translation.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
Section 2 is a synopsis of our statistical approach to machine translation.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"

In Section 4 we describe our series of models of the translation process and give an informal discussion of the algorithms by which we estimate their parameters from data.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We have written Section 4 with two aims in mind: first, to provide the interested reader with sufficient detail to reproduce our results, and second, to hold the mathematics at the level of college calculus.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
A few more difficult parts of the discussion have been postponed to the Appendix.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 5, we present results obtained by estimating the parameters for these models from a large collection of aligned pairs of sentences from the Canadian Hansard data (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"For a number of English words, we show translation probabilities that give convincing evidence of the power of statistical methods to extract linguistically interesting correlations from large corpora.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
We also show automatically derived word-by-word alignments for several sentences.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 6, we discuss some shortcomings of our models and propose modifications to address some of them.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In the final section, we discuss the significance of our work and the possibility of extending it to other pairs of languages.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Finally, we include two appendices: one to summarize notation and one to collect the formulae for the various models that we describe and to fill an occasional gap in our development.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In 1949, Warren Weaver suggested applying the statistical and cryptanalytic techniques then emerging from the nascent field of communication theory to the problem of using computers to translate text from one natural language to another (published in Weaver 1955).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Efforts in this direction were soon abandoned for various philosophical and theoretical reasons, but at a time when the most advanced computers were of a piece with today's digital watch, any such approach was surely doomed to computational starvation.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Today, the fruitful application of statistical methods to the study of machine translation is within the computational grasp of anyone with a well-equipped workstation.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"A string of English words, e, can be translated into a string of French words in many different ways.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Often, knowing the broader context in which e occurs may serve to winnow the field of acceptable French translations, but even so, many acceptable translations will remain; the choice among them is largely a matter of taste.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In statistical translation, we take the view that every French string, f, is a possible translation of e. We assign to every pair of strings (e, f) a number Pr (f le), which we interpret as the probability that a translator, when presented with e, will produce f as his translation.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We further take the view that when a native speaker of French produces a string of French words, he has actually conceived of a string of English words, which he translated mentally.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Given a French string f, the job of our translation system is to find the string e that the native speaker had in mind when he produced f. We minimize our chance of error by choosing that English string e for which Pr (e If ) is greatest.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Using Bayes' theorem, we can write Since the denominator here is independent of e, finding Ãª is the same as finding e so as to make the product Pr(e) Pr(fl e) as large as possible.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We arrive, then, at the Fundamental Equation of Machine Translation: As a representation of the process by which a human being translates a passage from French to English, this equation is fanciful at best.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"One can hardly imagine someone rifling mentally through the list of all English passages computing the product of the a priori probability of the passage, Pr(e), and the conditional probability of the French passage given the English passage, POI e).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Instead, there is an overwhelming intuitive appeal to the idea that a translator proceeds by first understanding the French, and then expressing in English the meaning that he has thus grasped.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Many people have been guided by this intuitive picture when building machine translation systems.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"From a purely formal point of view, on the other hand, Equation (2) is completely adequate.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
The conditional distribution POI e) is just an enormous table that associates a real number between zero and one with every possible pairing of a French passage and an English passage.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"With the proper choice for this distribution, translations of arbitrarily high quality can be achieved.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Of course, to construct Pr(f le) by examining individual pairs of French and English passages one by one is out of the question.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Even if we restrict our attention to passages no longer than a typical novel, there are just too many such pairs.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"But this is only a problem in practice, not in principle.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The essential question for statistical translation, then, is not a philosophical one, but an empirical one: Can one construct approximations to the distributions Pr(e) and Pr(f le) that are good enough to achieve an acceptable quality of translation?","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Equation (2) summarizes the three computational challenges presented by the practice of statistical translation: estimating the language model probability, Pr(e); estimating the translation model probability, Pr(f le); and devising an effective and efficient suboptimal search for the English string that maximizes their product.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We call these the language modeling problem, the translation modeling problem, and the search problem.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The language modeling problem for machine translation is essentially the same as that for speech recognition and has been dealt with elsewhere in that context (see, for example, the recent paper by Maltese and Mancini [1992] and references therein).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
We hope to deal with the search problem in a later paper.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, we focus on the translation modeling problem.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Before we turn to this problem, however, we should address an issue that may be a concern to some readers: Why do we estimate Pr(e) and POI e) rather than estimate Pr(e If) directly?","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
We are really interested in this latter probability.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Wouldn't we reduce our problems from three to two by this direct approach?,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"If we can estimate POI e) adequately, why can't we just turn the whole process around to estimate Pr (el f)?","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"To understand this, imagine that we divide French and English strings into those that are well-formed and those that are ill-formed.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
This is not a precise notion.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We have in mind that strings like Il va a la bibliotheque, or I live in a house, or even Colorless green ideas sleep furiously are well-formed, but that strings like a la va Il bibliotheque or a I in live house are not.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"When we translate a French string into English, we can think of ourselves as springing from a well-formed French string into the sea of well-formed English strings with the hope of landing on a good one.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"It is important, therefore, that our model for Pr(elf) concentrate its probability as much as possible on wellformed English strings.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
But it is not important that our model for POI e) concentrate its probability on well-formed French strings.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"If we were to reduce the probability of all well-formed French strings by the same factor, spreading the probability thus liberated over ill-formed French strings, there would be no effect on our translations: the argument that maximizes some function f(x) also maximizes cf(x) for any positive constant c. As we shall see below, our translation models are prodigal, spraying probability all over the place, most of it on ill-formed French strings.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In fact, as we discuss in Section 4.5, two of our models waste much of their probability on things that are not strings at all, having, for example, several different second words but no first word.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"If we were to turn one of these models around to model Pr(elf) directly, the result would be a model with so little probability concentrated on well-formed English strings as to confound any scheme to discover one.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
The two factors in Equation (2) cooperate.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The translation model probability is large for English strings, whether well- or ill-formed, that have the necessary words in them in roughly the right places to explain the French.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
The language model probability is large for well-formed English strings regardless of their connection to the French.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Together, they produce a large probability for well-formed English strings that account well for the French.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
We cannot achieve this simply by reversing our translation models.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We say that a pair of strings that are translations of one another form a translation, and we show this by enclosing the strings in parentheses and separating them by a vertical bar.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Thus, we write the translation (Qu'aurions-nous Pu faire?","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
I What could we have done?) to show that What could we have done? is a translation of Qu'aurions-nous pu faire?,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"When the strings end in sentences, we usually omit the final stop unless it is a question mark or an exclamation point.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
Brown et al. (1990) introduce the idea of an alignment between a pair of strings as an object indicating for each word in the French string that word in the English string from which it arose.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Alignments are shown graphically, as in Figure 1, by drawing lines, which we call connections, from some of the English words to some of the French words.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"The alignment in Figure 1 has seven connections: (the, Le), (program, programme), and so on.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Following the notation of Brown et al., we write this alignment as (Le programme a ete mis en application I And the(1) program(2) has(3) been(4) implemented(5,6,7)).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
The list of numbers following an English word shows the positions in the French string of the words to which it is connected.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Because And is not connected to any French words here, there is no list of numbers after it.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"We consider every alignment to be correct with some probability, and so we find (Le programme a ete mis en application I And(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) the program has been implemented) perfectly acceptable.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Of course, we expect it to be much less probable than the alignment shown in Figure 1.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"In Figure 1 each French word is connected to exactly one English word, but more general alignments are possible and may be appropriate for some translations.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, we may have a French word connected to several English words as in Figure 2, which we write as (Le reste appartenait aux autoch tones I The(1) balance(2) was(3) the(3) territory(3) of(4) the(4) aboriginal(5) people(5)).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"More generally still, we may have several French words connected to several English words as in Figure 3, which we write as (Les pauvres sont demunis I The(1) poor(2) don't(3,4) have(3,4) any(3,4) money(3,4)).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Here, the four English words don't have any money work together to generate the two French words sont demunis.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"In a figurative sense, an English passage is a web of concepts woven together according to the rules of English grammar.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"When we look at a passage, we cannot see the concepts directly but only the words that they leave behind.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"To show that these words are related to a concept but are not quite the whole story, we say that they form a cept.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Some of the words in a passage may participate in more than one cept, while others may participate in none, serving only as a sort of syntactic glue to bind the whole together.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"When a passage is translated into French, each of its cepts contributes some French words to the translation.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
We formalize this use of the term cept and relate it to the idea of an alignment as follows.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
We call the set of English words connected to a French word in a particular alignment the cept that generates the French word.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Thus, an alignment resolves an English string into a set of possibly overlapping cepts that we call the ceptual scheme of the English string with respect to the alignment.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"The alignment in Figure 3 contains the three cepts The, poor, and don't have any money.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"When one or more of the French words is connected to no English words, we say that the ceptual scheme includes the empty cept and that each of these words has been generated by this empty cept.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Formally, a cept is a subset of the positions in the English string together with the words occupying those positions.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"When we write the words that make up a cept, we sometimes affix a subscript to each one showing its position.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"The alignment in Figure 2 includes the cepts thei and 016 the7, but not the cepts of6 thei or the7.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"In (J'applaudis a la decision I 1(1) applaud(2) the(4) decision(5)), a is generated by the empty cept.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Although the empty cept has no position, we place it by convention in position zero, and write it as eo.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Thus, we may also write the previous alignment as (J'applaudis a la decision e0(3) 1(1) applaud(2) the(4) decision(5)).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"We denote the set of alignments of (fl e) by .,4(e, f).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"If e has length 1 and f has length in, there are /m different connections that can be drawn between them because each of the m French words can be connected to any of the 1 English words.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Since an alignment is determined by the connections that it contains, and since a subset of the possible connections can be chosen in 2&quot; ways, there are 2&quot; alignments in A(e, f).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"In this section, we develop a series of five translation models together with the algorithms necessary to estimate their parameters.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Each model gives a prescription for computing the conditional probability Pr(f le), which we call the likelihood of the translation (f, e).","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
This likelihood is a function of a large number of free parameters that we must estimate in a process that we call training.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
The likelihood of a set of translations is the product of the likelihoods of its members.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In broad outline, our plan is to guess values for these parameters and then to apply the EM algorithm (Baum 1972; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) iteratively so as to approach a local maximum of the likelihood of a particular set of translations that we call the training data.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"When the likelihood of the training data has more than one local maximum, the one that we approach will depend on our initial guess.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In Models 1 and 2, we first choose a length for the French string, assuming all reasonable lengths to be equally likely.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Then, for each position in the French string, we decide how to connect it to the English string and what French word to place there.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
In Model 1 we assume all connections for each French position to be equally likely.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, the order of the words in e and f does not affect Pr(fl e).","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
In Model 2 we make the more realistic assumption that the probability of a connection depends on the positions it connects and on the lengths of the two strings.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, for Model 2, Pr (f I e) does depend on the order of the words in e and f. Although it is possible to obtain interesting correlations between some pairs of frequent words in the two languages using Models 1 and 2, as we will see later (in Figure 5), these models often lead to unsatisfactory alignments.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In Models 3, 4, and 5, we develop the French string by choosing, for each word in the English string, first the number of words in the French string that will be connected to it, then the identity of these French words, and finally the actual positions in the French string that these words will occupy.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
It is this last step that determines the connections between the English string and the French string and it is here that these three models differ.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In Model 3, as in Model 2, the probability of a connection depends on the positions that it connects and on the lengths of the English and French strings.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
In Model 4 the probability of a connection depends in addition on the identities of the French and English words connected and on the positions of any other French words that are connected to the same English word.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Models 3 and 4 are deficient, a technical concept defined and discussed in Section 4.5.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Briefly, this means that they waste some of their probability on objects that are not French strings at all.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Model 5 is very much like Model 4, except that it is not deficient.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
Models 1-4 serve as stepping stones to the training of Model 5.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
Models 1 and 2 have an especially simple mathematical form so that iterations of the EM algorithm can be computed exactly.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"That is, we can explicitly perform sums over all possible alignments for these two models.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In addition, Model 1 has a unique local maximum so that parameters derived for it in a series of EM iterations do not depend on the starting point for the iterations.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"As explained below, we use Model 1 to provide initial estimates for the parameters of Model 2.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In Model 2 and subsequent models, the likelihood function does not have a unique local maximum, but by initializing each model from the parameters of the model before it, we arrive at estimates of the parameters of the final model that do not depend on our initial estimates of the parameters for Model 1.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In Models 3 and 4, we must be content with approximate EM iterations because it is not feasible to carry out sums over all possible alignments for these models.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"But, while approaching more closely the complexity of Model 5, they retain enough simplicity to allow an efficient investigation of the neighborhood of probable alignments and therefore allow us to include what we hope are all of the important alignments in each EM iteration.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In the remainder of this section, we give an informal but reasonably precise description of each of the five models and an intuitive account of the EM algorithm as applied to them.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"We assume the reader to be comfortable with Lagrange multipliers, partial differentiation, and constrained optimization as they are presented in a typical college calculus text, and to have a nodding acquaintance with random variables.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"On the first time through, the reader may wish to jump from here directly to Section 5, returning to this Section when and if he should desire to understand more deeply how the results reported later are achieved.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"The basic mathematical object with which we deal here is the joint probability distribution Pr(F = f, A = a, E = e), where the random variables F and E are a French string and an English string making up a translation, and the random variable A is an alignment between them.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"We also consider various marginal and conditional probability distributions that can be constructed from Pr(F = f, A = a, E = e), especially the distribution Pr(F = fl E = e).","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
We generally follow the common convention of using uppercase letters to denote random variables and the corresponding lowercase letters to denote specific values that the random variables may take.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"We have already used 1 and in to represent the lengths of the strings e and f, and so we use L and M to denote the corresponding random variables.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"When there is no possibility for confusion, or, more properly, when the probability of confusion is not thereby materially increased, we write Pr (f, a, e) for Pr(F f, A = a, E = e), and use similar shorthands throughout.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"We can write the likelihood of (f le) in terms of the conditional probability Pr(f, ale) as The sum here, like all subsequent sums over a, is over the elements of A(e, f).","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
We restrict ourselves in this section to alignments like the one shown in Figure 1 where each French word has exactly one connection.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In this kind of alignment, each cept is either a single English word or it is empty.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, we can assign cepts to positions in the English string, reserving position zero .for the empty cept.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"If the English string, e = e1e2... e1, has 1 words, and the French string, f = firn 1112 â¢ fm, has m words, then the alignment, a, can be represented by a series, ay' a1a2 ...am, of m values, each between 0 and 1 such that if the word in position j of the French string is connected to the word in position i of the English string, then al = i, and if it is not connected to any English word, then a] = 0.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Without loss of generality, we can write This is only one of many ways in which Pr(f, ale) can be written as the product of a series of conditional probabilities.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
It is important to realize that Equation (4) is not an approximation.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Regardless of the form of Pr(f, ale), it can always be analyzed into a product of terms in this way.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"We are simply asserting in this equation that when we generate a French string together with an alignment from an English string, we can first choose the length of the French string given our knowledge of the English string.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
Then we can choose where to connect the first position in the French string given our knowledge of the English string and the length of the French string.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"Then we can choose the identity of the first word in the French string given our knowledge of the English string, the length of the French string, and the position in the English string to which the first position in the French string is connected, and so on.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"As we step through the French string, at each point we make our next choice given our complete knowledge of the English string and of all our previous choices as to the details of the French string and its alignment.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
The conditional probabilities on the right-hand side of Equation (4) cannot all be taken as independent parameters because there are too many of them.,"{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"In Model 1, we assume that Pr(mle) is independent of e and m; that Pr(ajlail-1,fil-17 rrt,e), depends only on 1,.the length of the English string, and therefore must be (1 + 1)-1; and that Pr(fin, e) depends only on f and eaj.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"The parameters, then, are â¬ Pr(m le), I and t(le) E Pr(fi e) , which we call the translation probability of fl given ea,.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"We think of E as some small, fixed number.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"The distribution of M, the length of the French string, is unnormalized but this is a minor technical issue of no significance to our computations.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"
"If we wish, we can think of M as having some finite range.","{'title': '4.', 'number': '5'}"

"In an effort to eliminate some of the typographical errors that abound in the text, we have chosen as our English vocabulary all of those words that appear at least twice in English sentences in our data, and as our French vocabulary all of those words that appear at least twice in French sentences in our data.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
All other words we replace with a special unknown English word or unknown French word accordingly as they appear in an English sentence or a French sentence.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"We arrive in this way at an English vocabulary of 42,005 words and a French vocabulary of 58,016 words.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Some typographical errors are quite frequent, for example, momento for memento, and so our vocabularies are not completely free of them.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"At the same time, some words are truly rare, and so we have, in some cases, snubbed legitimate words.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"

"After each iteration, we retain individual values only for those translation probabilities that surpass a threshold; the remainder we set to a small value (10-12).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"This value is so small that it does not affect the normalization conditions, but is large enough that translation probabilities can be resurrected during later iterations.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"

"By the final iteration, only 1, 658, 364 probabilities survive, an average of about 39 French words for each English word.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Although the entire t array has 2, 437, 020, 096 entries, and we need to store it twice, once as probabilities and once as counts, it is clear from the preceeding remarks that we need never deal with more than about 25 million counts or about 12 million probabilities.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"

"This sudden jump is not because Model 3 is a poorer model than Model 2, but because Model 3 is deficient: the great majority of its probability is squandered on objects that are not strings of French words.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"

"On the other hand, we see that nodding, which in Models 1, 2, and 3 is connected only to signe and oui, is correctly connected to the entire phrase faire signe que oui in Model 5.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"In the second example, (Voyez les profits que ils ont realises I Look at the profits they have made), Models 1, 2, and 3 incorrectly connect profits4 to both profits3 and realises7, but with Model 5, profits4 is correctly connected only to profits3, and made7 is connected to rea/ises7.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"

"We can easily extend the generative process upon which Models 3, 4, and 5 are based to encompass multi-word cepts.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
