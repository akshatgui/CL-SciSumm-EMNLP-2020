"Traditional information extraction systems have focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small, homogeneous corpora.",Experiment/Discussion
"In contrast, the TEXTRUNNER system demonstrates a new kind of information extraction, called Open Information Extraction (OIE), in which the system makes a single, data-driven pass over the entire corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples, without requiring any human input.",Experiment/Discussion
"(Banko et al., 2007) TEXTRUNNER is a fullyimplemented, highly scalable example of OIE.",Experiment/Discussion
"TEXTRUNNER's extractions are indexed, allowing a fast query mechanism.",Experiment/Discussion
Our first public demonstration of the TEXTRUNNER system shows the results of performing OIE on a set of 117 million web pages.,Experiment/Discussion
"It demonstrates the power of TEXTRUNNER in terms of the raw number of facts it has extracted, as well as its precision using our novel assessment mechanism.",Experiment/Discussion
And it shows the ability to automatically determine synonymous relations and objects using large sets of extractions.,Experiment/Discussion
We have built a fast user interface for querying the results.,Experiment/Discussion
"The bulk of previous information extraction work uses hand-labeled data or hand-crafted patterns to enable relation-specific extraction (e.g., (Culotta et al., 2006)).",Experiment/Discussion
OIE seeks to avoid these requirements for human input.,Experiment/Discussion
"Shinyama and Sekine (Shinyama and Sekine, 2006) describe an approach to “unrestricted relation discovery” that does away with many of the requirements for human input.",Experiment/Discussion
"However, it requires clustering of the documents used for extraction, and thus scales in quadratic time in the number of documents.",Experiment/Discussion
It does not scale to the size of the Web.,Experiment/Discussion
"For a full discussion of previous work, please see (Banko et al., 2007), or see (Yates and Etzioni, 2007) for work relating to synonym resolution.",Experiment/Discussion
"OIE presents significant new challenges for information extraction systems, including Automation of relation extraction, which in traditional information extraction uses handlabeled inputs.",Experiment/Discussion
"Corpus Heterogeneity on the Web, which makes tools like parsers and named-entity taggers less accurate because the corpus is different from the data used to train the tools.",Experiment/Discussion
Scalability and efficiency of the system.,Experiment/Discussion
"Open IE systems are effectively restricted to a single, fast pass over the data so that they can scale to huge document collections.",Experiment/Discussion
"In response to these challenges, TEXTRUNNER includes several novel components, which we now summarize (see (Banko et al., 2007) for details).",Experiment/Discussion
"The TEXTRUNNER extractor makes a single pass over all documents, tagging sentences with part-of-speech tags and nounphrase chunks as it goes.",Experiment/Discussion
"For each pair of noun phrases that are not too far apart, and subject to several other constraints, it applies a classifier described below to determine whether or not to extract a relationship.",Experiment/Discussion
"If the classifier deems the relationship trustworthy, a tuple of the form t = (ei, rj, ek) is extracted, where ei, ek are entities and rj is the relation between them.",Experiment/Discussion
"For example, TEXTRUNNER might extract the tuple (Edison, invented, light bulbs).",Experiment/Discussion
"On our test corpus (a 9 million document subset of our full corpus), it took less than 68 CPU hours to process the 133 million sentences.",Experiment/Discussion
"The process is easily parallelized, and took only 4 hours to run on our cluster.",Experiment/Discussion
"While full parsing is too expensive to apply to the Web, we use a parser to generate training examples for extraction.",Experiment/Discussion
"Using several heuristic constraints, we automatically label a set of parsed sentences as trustworthy or untrustworthy extractions (positive and negative examples, respectively).",Experiment/Discussion
"The classifier is trained on these examples, using features such as the part of speech tags on the words in the relation.",Experiment/Discussion
The classifier is then able to decide whether a sequence of POS-tagged words is a correct extraction with high accuracy.,Experiment/Discussion
"Because TEXTRUNNER has no pre-defined relations, it may extract many different strings representing the same relation.",Experiment/Discussion
"Also, as with all information extraction systems, it can extract multiple names for the same object.",Experiment/Discussion
The RESOLVER system performs an unsupervised clustering of TEXTRUNNER's extractions to create sets of synonymous entities and relations.,Experiment/Discussion
"RESOLVER uses a novel, unsupervised probabilistic model to determine the probability that any pair of strings is co-referential, given the tuples that each string was extracted with.",Experiment/Discussion
"(Yates and Etzioni, 2007)",Experiment/Discussion
"TEXTRUNNER builds an inverted index of the extracted tuples, and spreads it across a cluster of machines.",Experiment/Discussion
"This architecture supports fast, interactive, and powerful relational queries.",Experiment/Discussion
"Users may enter words in a relation or entity, and TEXTRUNNER quickly returns the entire set of extractions matching the query.",Experiment/Discussion
"For example, a query for “Newton” will return tuples like (Newton, invented, calculus).",Experiment/Discussion
"Users may opt to query for all tuples matching synonyms of the keyword input, and may also opt to merge all tuples returned by a query into sets of tuples that are deemed synonymous.",Experiment/Discussion
"On our test corpus of 9 million Web documents, TEXTRUNNER extracted 7.8 million well-formed tuples.",Results/Conclusion
"On a randomly selected subset of 400 tuples, 80.4% were deemed correct by human reviewers.",Results/Conclusion
"We performed a head-to-head comparison with a state-of-the-art traditional information extraction system, called KNOWITALL.",Results/Conclusion
"(Etzioni et al., 2005) On a set of ten high-frequency relations, TEXTRUNNER found nearly as many correct extractions as KNOWITALL (11,631 to 11,476), while reducing the error rate of KNOWITALL by 33% (18% to 12%).",Results/Conclusion
