Problems with efficiently parsing formalisms based on potentially infinite nonterminal domains have manifested themselves in many different ways.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Traditional solutions have involved limiting in some way the class of grammars that can be parsed.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The limitations can be applied to the formalism by, for instance. adding a context-free &quot;backbone.&quot; If we require that a context-free subgrammar be implicit in every grammar, the subgrammar can be used for parsing and the rest of the grammar used as a filter during or after parsing.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"This solution has been recommended for functional unification grammars (FUG) by Martin Kay 161; its legacy can be seen in the context-free skeleton of LFG, and the Hewlett-Packard GPSC; system 131, and in the cat feature requirement in PATR-Il that is described below.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"However, several problems inhere in this solution of mandating a context-free backbone.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"First, the move from context-free to complex-feature-based formalisms was motivated by the desire to structure the notion of nonterminal.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Many analyses take advantage of this by eliminating mention of major category information from particular rules' or by structuring the major category itself (say into binary N and V features plus a bar-level feature as in X-based theories).,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Forcing the primacy and atomicity of major category defeats part of the purpose of structured category systems.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Second. and perhaps more critically, because only certain of the information in a rule is used to guide the parse, say major category information, only such information can be used to filter spurious hypotheses by top-down filtering.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that this problem occurs even if filtering by the rule information is used to eliminate at the earliest possible time constituents and partial constituents proposed during parsing (as is the case in the PATR-II implementation and the 'See. for instance, the coordination and copular &quot;be&quot; analyses from CPSC [41, the nested VP analysis used in some PATR-Il grammars 1151, or almost all categorial analyses, in which general rules of combination play the role of specific phrase-structure rules.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Earley algorithm given below; cf. the Xerox LFG system).,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, if information about subcategorization is left out of the category information in the context-free skeleton, it cannot be used to eliminate prediction edges.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, if we find a verb that subcategorizes for a noun phrase, but the grammar rules allow postverbal NPs, PPs, s, VPs, and so forth, the parser will have no way to eliminate the building of edges corresponding to these categories.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Only when such edges attempt to join with the V will the inconsistency be found.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Similarly, if information about filler-gap dependencies is kept extrinsic to the category information, as in a slash category in GPSG or an LFG annotation concerning a matching constituent for a it specification, there will be no way to keep from hypothesizing gaps at any given vertex.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
This &quot;gap-proliferation&quot; problem has plagued many attempts at building parsers for grammar formalisms in this style.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"In fact, by making these stringent requirements on what information is used to guide parsing, we have to a certain extent thrown the baby out with the bathwater.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"These formalisms were intended to free us from the tyranny of atomic nonterminal symbols, but for good performance. we are forced toward analyses putting more and more information in an atomic category feature.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
An example of this phenomenon can be seen in the author's paper on LR syntactic preference parsing 1141.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Because the LALR table building algorithm does not in general terminate for complex-featurebased grammar formalisms, the grammar used in that paper was a simple context-free grammar with subcategorization and gap information placed in the atomic nonterminal symbol.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"On the other hand, the grammar formalism can be left unchanged, but particular grammars developed that happen not to succumb to the problems inherent in the general parsing problem for the formalism.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The solution mentioned above of placing more information in the category symbol falls into this class.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"

"In building a general tool for grammar testing and debugging, however, we would like to commit as little as possible to a particular grammar or style of grammar.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"= Furthermore, the grammar designer should not be held down in building an analysis by limitations of the algorithms.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Thus a solution requiring careful crafting of grammars is inadequate.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Finally, specialized parsing algorithms eau he designed that make use of information about the part Hilar grammar being parsed to eliminate spurious edges or hypotheses.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Rather than using a general parsing algorithm on a limited formalism, Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan [2] chose a specialized algorithm working on grammars in the full LFG formalism to model syntactic preferences.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Current work at Hewlett-Packard on parsing recent variants of GPSG seems to take this line as well.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Again, we feel that the separation of burden is inappropriate in such an attack, especially in a grammar-development context.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Coupling the grammar design and parser design problems in this way leads to the linguistic and technological problems becoming inherently mixed, magnifying the difficulty of writing an adequate grammar/parser system.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Instead, we would like a parsing algorithm that placed no restraints on the grammars it could handle as long as they could be expressed within the intended formalism.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Still, the algorithm should take advantage of that part of the arbitrarily large amount of information in the complex-feature structures that is significant for guiding parsing with the particular grammar.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"One of the aforementioned solutions is to require the grammar writer to put all such significant information in a special atomic symbol—i.e., mandate a context-free backbone.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Another is to use all of the feature structure information—but this method, as we shall see, inevitably leads to nonterminating algorithms.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
A compromise is to parameterize the parsing algorithm by a small amount of grammar-dependent information that tells the algorithm which of the information in the feature structures is significant for guiding the parse.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"That is, the parameter determines how to split up the infinite nonterminal domain into a finite set of equivalence classes that can be used for parsing.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"By doing so, we have an optimal compromise: Whatever part of the feature structure is significant we distinguish in the equivalence classes by setting the parameter appropriately, so the information is used in parsing.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"But because there are only a finite number of equivalence classes, parsing algorithms guided in this way will terminate.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The technique we use to form equivalence classes is restriction, which involves taking a quotient of the domain with respect to a restrictor.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The restrictor thus serves as the sole repository of grammar-dependent information in the algorithm.,"{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"By tuning the restrictor, the set of equivalence classes engendered can be changed, making the algorithm more or less efficient at guiding the parse.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"But independent of the restrictor, the algorithm will be correct, since it is still doing parsing over a finite domain of &quot;nonterminals,&quot; namely, the elements of the restricted domain.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"This idea can be applied to solve many of the problems engendered by infinite nonterminal domains, allowing preprocessing of grammars as required by LR and LC algorithms, allowing top-down filtering or prediction as in Earley and top-down backtrack parsing, guaranteeing termination, etc.","{'title': '2 Traditional Solutions and an Alternative Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Before discussing the use of restriction in parsing algorithms, we present some technical details, including a brief introduction to the PATR-II grammar formalism, which will serve as the grammatical formalism that the presented algorithms will interpret.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
PATR-II is a simple grammar formalism that can serve as the least common denominator of many of the complex-feature-based and unification-based formalisms prevalent in linguistics and computational linguistics.,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
As such it provides a good testbed for describing algorithms for complex-feature-based formalisms.,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"The PATR-II nonterminal domain is a lattice of directed, acyclic, graph structures (dags).3 Dags can be thought of as similar to the reentrant f-structures of LFG or functional structures of FUG, and we will use the bracketed notation associated with these formalisms for them.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"For example. the following is a dag (D0) in this notation, with reentrancy indicated with coindexing boxes: Dags come in two varieties, complex (like the one above) and atomic (like the dags h and c in the example).","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"Complex dags can be viewed as partial functions from labels to dag values, and the notation D(l) will therefore denote the value associated with the label / in the dag D. In the same spirit. we can refer to the domain of a dag (dorn(D)).","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
A dag with an empty domain is often called an empty dag or variable.,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"A path in a dag is a sequence of label names (notated, e.g.. (d e I)), which can be used to pick out a particular subpart of the dag by repeated application (in this case, the dag (g : hi).","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"We will extend the notation D(p) in the obvious way to include the subdag of D picked out by a path p. We will also occasionally use the square brackets as the Hag constructor function, so that If : Di where D is an expression denoting a dag will denote the dag whose f feature has value D. There is a natural lattice structure for dags based on substimption—an ordering on (lags that roughly corre,pow Is to the compatibility and relative specificity of information 3 The reader is referred to earlier works 115,101 for more detailed discussions of dag structures. contained in the dags.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"Intuitively viewed, a dag D subsumes a dag D' (notated DC D') if D contains a subset of the information in (i.e., is more general than) U.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"Thus variables subsume all other dags, atomic or complex, because as the trivial case, they contain no information at all.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
A complex dag D subsumes a complex dag Ds if and only if D(1) C DT) for all I E dom(D) and Ds(P) = f/(q) for all paths p and q such that D(p) = D(q).,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
An atomic dag neither subsumes nor is subsumed by any different atomic dag.,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"For instance, the following subsumption relations hold: Finally, given two dags D' and D&quot;, the unification of the dags is the most general dag D such that D' C D and D&quot; C D. We notate this D = D' U D&quot;.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
The following examples illustrate the notion of unification: The unification of two dags is not always well-defined.,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"In the cases where no unification exists, the unification is said to fail.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"

"Formally, we define restriction as follows.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"

"That is, every path in the restricted dag is either undefined, atomic, or specifically allowed by the restrictor.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"The restriction process can be viewed as putting dags into equivalence classes, each equivalence class being the largest set of dags that all are restricted to the same dag (which we will call its canonical member).","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"It follows from the definition that in general DM) C D. Finally, if we disallow infinite relations as restrictors (i.e., restrictors must not allow values for an infinite number of distinct paths) as we will do for the remainder of the discussion, we are guaranteed to have only a finite number of equivalence classes.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"Actually, in the sequel we will use a particularly simple subclass of restrictors that are generable from sets of paths.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"Given a set of paths s, we can define (I) such that p43.1 if and only if p is a prefix of some p' E s. Such restrictors can be understood as &quot;throwing away' all values not lying on one of the given paths.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
This subclass of restrictors is sufficient for most applications.,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"

"For instance, we might have the following rule: By notational convention, we can eliminate unifications for the special feature cat (the atomic major category feature) recording this information implicitly by using it in the &quot;name&quot; of the constituent, e.g., If we require that this notational convention always be used (in so doing, guaranteeing that each constituent have an atomic major category associated with it), we have thereby mandated a context-free backbone to the grammar, and can then use standard context-free parsing algorithms to parse sentences relative to grammars in this formalism.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
Limiting to a context-free-based PATR-II is the solution that previous implementations have incorporated.,"{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"Before proceeding to describe parsing such a context-freebased PATR-II, we make one more purely notational change.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"
"Rather than associating with each grammar rule a set of unifications, we instead associate a dag that incorporates all of those unifications implicitly, i.e., a rule is associated with a dag D, such that for all unifications of the form p q in the rule.","{'title': '3 Technical Preliminaries', 'number': '4'}"

"This algorithm on the previous grammar, using a restrictor that allows through only the cat feature of a dag, operates as before, but predicts the first time around the more general edge: Another round of prediction yields this same edge so the process terminates immediately. duck Because the predicted edge is more general than (i.e., subsumes) all the infinite number of edges it replaced that were predicted under the nonterminating extension, it preserves completeness.","{'title': ""4 Using Restriction to Extend Ear-. ley's Algorithm for PATR-II"", 'number': '5'}"
