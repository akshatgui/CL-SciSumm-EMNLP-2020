We investigate the lexical and syntactic flexibility of a class of idiomatic expressions.,{}
"We develop measures that draw on such linguistic properties, and demonstrate that these statistical, corpus-based measures can be successfully used for distinguishing idiomatic combinations from non-idiomatic ones.",{}
"We also propose a means for automatically determining which syntactic forms a particular idiom can appear in, and hence should be included in its lexical representation.",{}
"The term idiom has been applied to a fuzzy category with prototypical examples such as by and large, kick the bucket, and let the cat out of the bag.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Providing a definitive answer for what idioms are, and determining how they are learned and understood, are still subject to debate (Glucksberg, 1993; Nunberg et al., 1994).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Nonetheless, they are often defined as phrases or sentences that involve some degree of lexical, syntactic, and/or semantic idiosyncrasy.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Idiomatic expressions, as a part of the vast family of figurative language, are widely used both in colloquial speech and in written language.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Moreover, a phrase develops its idiomaticity over time (Cacciari, 1993); consequently, new idioms come into existence on a daily basis (Cowie et al., 1983; Seaton and Macaulay, 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Idioms thus pose a serious challenge, both for the creation of widecoverage computational lexicons, and for the development of large-scale, linguistically plausible natural language processing (NLP) systems (Sag et al., 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
One problem is due to the range of syntactic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic expressions.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Some idioms, such as by and large, contain syntactic violations; these are often completely fixed and hence can be listed in a lexicon as “words with spaces” (Sag et al., 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, among those idioms that are syntactically well-formed, some exhibit limited morphosyntactic flexibility, while others may be more syntactically flexible.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, the idiom shoot the breeze undergoes verbal inflection (shot the breeze), but not internal modification or passivization (?shoot the fun breeze, ?the breeze was shot).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In contrast, the idiom spill the beans undergoes verbal inflection, internal modification, and even passivization.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Clearly, a words-withspaces approach does not capture the full range of behaviour of such idiomatic expressions.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Another barrier to the appropriate handling of idioms in a computational system is their semantic idiosyncrasy.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This is a particular issue for those idioms that conform to the grammar rules of the language.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Such idiomatic expressions are indistinguishable on the surface from compositional (nonidiomatic) phrases, but a computational system must be capable of distinguishing the two.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, a machine translation system should translate the idiom shoot the breeze as a single unit of meaning (“to chat”), whereas this is not the case for the literal phrase shoot the bird.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this study, we focus on a particular class of English phrasal idioms, i.e., those that involve the combination of a verb plus a noun in its direct object position.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Examples include shoot the breeze, pull strings, and push one’s luck.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We refer to these as verb+noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The class of VNICs accommodates a large number of idiomatic expressions (Cowie et al., 1983; Nunberg et al., 1994).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Moreover, their peculiar behaviour signifies the need for a distinct treatment in a computational lexicon (Fellbaum, 2005).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Despite this, VNICs have been granted relatively little attention within the computational linguistics community.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We look into two closely related problems confronting the appropriate treatment of VNICs: (i) the problem of determining their degree of flexibility; and (ii) the problem of determining their level of idiomaticity.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Section 2 elaborates on the lexicosyntactic flexibility of VNICs, and how this relates to their idiomaticity.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 3, we propose two linguistically-motivated statistical measures for quantifying the degree of lexical and syntactic inflexibility (or fixedness) of verb+noun combinations.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Section 4 presents an evaluation of the proposed measures.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 5, we put forward a technique for determining the syntactic variations that a VNIC can undergo, and that should be included in its lexical representation.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Section 6 summarizes our contributions.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Although syntactically well-formed, VNICs involve a certain degree of semantic idiosyncrasy.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"Unlike compositional verb+noun combinations, the meaning of VNICs cannot be solely predicted from the meaning of their parts.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
There is much evidence in the linguistic literature that the semantic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic combinations is reflected in their lexical and/or syntactic behaviour.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"A limited number of idioms have one (or more) lexical variants, e.g., blow one’s own trumpet and toot one’s own horn (examples from Cowie et al. 1983).","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"However, most are lexically fixed (nonproductive) to a large extent.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
Neither shoot the wind nor fling the breeze are typically recognized as variations of the idiom shoot the breeze.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"Similarly, spill the beans has an idiomatic meaning (“to reveal a secret”), while spill the peas and spread the beans have only literal interpretations.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
Idiomatic combinations are also syntactically peculiar: most VNICs cannot undergo syntactic variations and at the same time retain their idiomatic interpretations.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"It is important, however, to note that VNICs differ with respect to the degree of syntactic flexibility they exhibit.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"Some are syntactically inflexible for the most part, while others are more versatile; as illustrated in 1 and 2: Linguists have explained the lexical and syntactic flexibility of idiomatic combinations in terms of their semantic analyzability (e.g., Glucksberg 1993; Fellbaum 1993; Nunberg et al. 1994).","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
Semantic analyzability is inversely related to idiomaticity.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, the meaning of shoot the breeze, a highly idiomatic expression, has nothing to do with either shoot or breeze.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"In contrast, a less idiomatic expression, such as spill the beans, can be analyzed as spill corresponding to “reveal” and beans referring to “secret(s)”.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"Generally, the constituents of a semantically analyzable idiom can be mapped onto their corresponding referents in the idiomatic interpretation.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
Hence analyzable (less idiomatic) expressions are often more open to lexical substitution and syntactic variation.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
We use the observed connection between idiomaticity and (in)flexibility to devise statistical measures for automatically distinguishing idiomatic from literal verb+noun combinations.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
While VNICs vary in their degree of flexibility (cf.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"1 and 2 above; see also Moon 1998), on the whole they contrast with compositional phrases, which are more lexically productive and appear in a wider range of syntactic forms.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
We thus propose to use the degree of lexical and syntactic flexibility of a given verb+noun combination to determine the level of idiomaticity of the expression.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
It is important to note that semantic analyzability is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for an idiomatic combination to be lexically or syntactically flexible.,"{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"Other factors, such as the communicative intentions and pragmatic constraints, can motivate a speaker to use a variant in place of a canonical form (Glucksberg, 1993).","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"Nevertheless, lexical and syntactic flexibility may well be used as partial indicators of semantic analyzability, and hence idiomaticity.","{'title': '2 Flexibility and Idiomaticity of VNICs', 'number': '2'}"
"Here we describe our measures for idiomaticity, which quantify the degree of lexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness of a given verb+noun combination, represented as a verb–noun pair.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"(Note that our measures quantify fixedness, not flexibility.)","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"A VNIC is lexically fixed if the replacement of any of its constituents by a semantically (and syntactically) similar word generally does not result in another VNIC, but in an invalid or a literal expression.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"One way of measuring lexical fixedness of a given verb+noun combination is thus to examine the idiomaticity of its variants, i.e., expressions generated by replacing one of the constituents by a similar word.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
This approach has two main challenges: (i) it requires prior knowledge about the idiomaticity of expressions (which is what we are developing our measure to determine); (ii) it needs information on “similarity” among words.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Inspired by Lin (1999), we examine the strength of association between the verb and noun constituents of the target combination and its variants, as an indirect cue to their idiomaticity.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"We use the automatically-built thesaurus of Lin (1998) to find similar words to the noun of the target expression, in order to automatically generate variants.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Only the noun constituent is varied, since replacing the verb constituent of a VNIC with a semantically related verb is more likely to yield another VNIC, as in keep/lose one’s cool (Nunberg et al., 1994).","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
Let be the set of the most similar nouns to the noun of the target pair .,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"We calculate the association strength for the target pair, and for each of its variants, , using pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church et al., 1991): where and is the target noun; is the set of all transitive verbs in the corpus; is the set of all nouns appearing as the direct object of some verb; is the frequency of and occurring as a verb–object pair; is the total frequency of the target verb with any noun in ; is the total frequency of the noun in the direct object position of any verb in .","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
Lin (1999) assumes that a target expression is non-compositional if and only if its value is significantly different from that of any of the variants.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Instead, we propose a novel technique that brings together the association strengths ( values) of the target and the variant expressions into a single measure reflecting the degree of lexical fixedness for the target pair.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
We assume that the target pair is lexically fixed to the extent that its deviates from the average of its variants.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Our measure calculates this deviation, normalized using the sample’s standard deviation: Compared to compositional verb+noun combinations, VNICs are expected to appear in more restricted syntactic forms.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"To quantify the syntactic fixedness of a target verb–noun pair, we thus need to: (i) identify relevant syntactic patterns, i.e., those that help distinguish VNICs from literal verb+noun combinations; (ii) translate the frequency distribution of the target pair in the identified patterns into a measure of syntactic fixedness.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Determining a unique set of syntactic patterns appropriate for the recognition of all idiomatic combinations is difficult indeed: exactly which forms an idiomatic combination can occur in is not entirely predictable (Sag et al., 2002).","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Nonetheless, there are hypotheses about the difference in behaviour of VNICs and literal verb+noun combinations with respect to particular syntactic variations (Nunberg et al., 1994).","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Linguists note that semantic analyzability is related to the referential status of the noun constituent, which is in turn related to participation in certain morphosyntactic forms.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"In what follows, we describe three types of variation that are tolerated by literal combinations, but are prohibited by many VNICs.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
Passivization There is much evidence in the linguistic literature that VNICs often do not undergo passivization.1 Linguists mainly attribute this to the fact that only a referential noun can appear as the surface subject of a passive construction.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Determiner Type A strong correlation exists between the flexibility of the determiner preceding the noun in a verb+noun combination and the overall flexibility of the phrase (Fellbaum, 1993).","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"It is however important to note that the nature of the determiner is also affected by other factors, such as the semantic properties of the noun.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Pluralization While the verb constituent of a VNIC is morphologically flexible, the morphological flexibility of the noun relates to its referential status.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
A non-referential noun constituent is expected to mainly appear in just one of the singular or plural forms.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
The pluralization of the noun is of course also affected by its semantic properties.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Merging the three variation types results in a pattern set, , of distinct syntactic patterns, given in Table 1.2 The second step is to devise a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of syntactic fixedness of a verb–noun pair, with respect to the selected set of patterns, .","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
We propose a measure that compares the “syntactic behaviour” of the target pair with that of a “typical” verb–noun pair.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
Syntactic behaviour of a typical pair is defined as the prior probability distribution over the patterns in .,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"The prior probability of an individual pattern is estimated as: The syntactic behaviour of the target verb–noun pair is defined as the posterior probability distribution over the patterns, given the particular pair.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"The posterior probability of an individual pattern is estimated as: The degree of syntactic fixedness of the target verb–noun pair is estimated as the divergence of its syntactic behaviour (the posterior distribution 2We collapse some patterns since with a larger pattern set the measure may require larger corpora to perform reliably. over the patterns), from the typical syntactic behaviour (the prior distribution).","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"The divergence of the two probability distributions is calculated using a standard information-theoretic measure, the Kullback Leibler (KL-)divergence: KL-divergence is always non-negative and is zero if and only if the two distributions are exactly the same.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, .","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
KL-divergence is argued to be problematic because it is not a symmetric measure.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Nonetheless, it has proven useful in many NLP applications (Resnik, 1999; Dagan et al., 1994).","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"Moreover, the asymmetry is not an issue here since we are concerned with the relative distance of several posterior distributions from the same prior.","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"VNICs are hypothesized to be, in most cases, both lexically and syntactically more fixed than literal verb+noun combinations (see Section 2).","{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
We thus propose a new measure of idiomaticity to be a measure of the overall fixedness of a given pair.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
We define as: where weights the relative contribution of the measures in predicting idiomaticity.,"{'title': '3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs', 'number': '3'}"
"To evaluate our proposed fixedness measures, we determine their appropriateness as indicators of idiomaticity.","{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
We pose a classification task in which idiomatic verb–noun pairs are distinguished from literal ones.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
We use each measure to assign scores to the experimental pairs (see Section 4.2 below).,"{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
"We then classify the pairs by setting a threshold, here the median score, where all expressions with scores higher than the threshold are labeled as idiomatic and the rest as literal.","{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
We assess the overall goodness of a measure by looking at its accuracy (Acc) and the relative reduction in error rate (RER) on the classification task described above.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
The RER of a measure reflects the improvement in its accuracy relative to another measure (often a baseline).,"{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
"We consider two baselines: (i) a random baseline, , that randomly assigns a label (literal or idiomatic) to each verb–noun pair; (ii) a more informed baseline, , an information-theoretic measure widely used for extracting statistically significant collocations.3 We use the British National Corpus (BNC; “http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/”) to extract verb– noun pairs, along with information on the syntactic patterns they appear in.","{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
"We automatically parse the corpus using the Collins parser (Collins, 1999), and further process it using TGrep2 (Rohde, 2004).","{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
"For each instance of a transitive verb, we use heuristics to extract the noun phrase (NP) in either the direct object position (if the sentence is active), or the subject position (if the sentence is passive).","{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"
"We then use NP-head extraction software4 to get the head noun of the extracted NP, its number (singular or plural), and the determiner introducing it.","{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"

"Basic verbs, in their literal use, refer to states or acts that are central to human experience.","{'title': '4 Evaluation of the Fixedness Measures', 'number': '4'}"

"Specifically, for each of the idiomatic pairs in TEST , we calculate the precision and recall of its predicted Cforms (those whose -scores are above ), compared to the Cforms listed in the two dictionaries.","{'title': '5 Determining the Canonical Forms', 'number': '5'}"
"The average precision across the 100 test pairs is 81.7%, and the average recall is 88.0% (with 69 of the pairs having 100% precision and 100% recall).","{'title': '5 Determining the Canonical Forms', 'number': '5'}"
"Moreover, we find that for the overwhelming majority of the pairs, , the predicted Cform with the highest -score appears in the dictionary entry of the pair.","{'title': '5 Determining the Canonical Forms', 'number': '5'}"

"In this regard, our work relates to previous studies on determining the compositionality (inverse of idiomaticity) of MWEs other than idioms.","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Most previous work on compositionality of MWEs either treat them as collocations (Smadja, 1993), or examine the distributional similarity between the expression and its constituents (McCarthy et al., 2003; Baldwin et al., 2003; Bannard et al., 2003).","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
Lin (1999) and Wermter and Hahn (2005) go one step further and look into a linguistic property of non-compositional compounds—their lexical fixedness—to identify them.,"{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) combine aspects of the above-mentioned work, by incorporating lexical fixedness, collocation-based, and distributional similarity measures into a set of features which are used to rank verb+noun combinations according to their compositionality.","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
Our work differs from such studies in that it carefully examines several linguistic properties of VNICs that distinguish them from literal (compositional) combinations.,"{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Moreover, we suggest novel techniques for translating such characteristics into measures that predict the idiomaticity level of verb+noun combinations.","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"

"We also show that our syntactic and overall fixedness measures substantially outperform a widely used measure of collocation, , even when the latter takes syntactic relations into account.","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"

Our syntactic fixedness measure looks into a broader set of patterns associated with a large class of idiomatic expressions.,"{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Moreover, our approach is general and can be easily extended to other idiomatic combinations.","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Each measure we use to identify VNICs captures a different aspect of idiomaticity: reflects the statistical idiosyncrasy of VNICs, while the fixedness measures draw on their lexicosyntactic peculiarities.","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Our ongoing work focuses on combining these measures to distinguish VNICs from other idiosyncratic verb+noun combinations that are neither purely idiomatic nor completely literal, so that we can identify linguistically plausible classes of verb+noun combinations on this continuum (Fazly and Stevenson, 2005).","{'title': '6 Discussion and Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
