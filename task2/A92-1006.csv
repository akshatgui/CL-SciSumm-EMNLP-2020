"The Joyce text generation system was developped part of the software design environment Ulysses (Korelsky and Ulysses Staff 1988; Rosenthal et al 1988) Ulysses includes a graphical environment for the design of secure, distributed software systems.","{'title': '2 The Joyce System in the Ulysses User Interface', 'number': '2'}"

"Note that the structures of the two texts are quite different: while the Host text is structured according to more abstract categories such as design structure and functionality, the Black Box text follows the path of the insecure flow through the component.","{'title': '2 The Joyce System in the Ulysses User Interface', 'number': '2'}"
"Joyce has been fully implemented in Common Lisp, and runs on the Symbolics Lisp Machine and on Sun workstations.","{'title': '2 The Joyce System in the Ulysses User Interface', 'number': '2'}"

"It passes it through the Incrementor to the Formater, which downgrades it when a classified corrected reading leaves through P34.","{'title': '2 The Joyce System in the Ulysses User Interface', 'number': '2'}"
"Joyce consists of three separate modules, which perform distinct tasks and access their own knowledge bases (Figure 5).","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Usually, the different tasks of text generation are divided among two modules (planning and realization), rather than three.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"However, there is a certain amount of disagreement about where the line between the two is to be drawn.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, McKeown's TEXT (McKeown 1985) performs the tasks that Joyce classifies as sentence planning as part of the realization process, whereas Meteer's SPOKESMAN (Meteer 1989) classifies them as part of text planning.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"(See (Meteer 1990, p.23sq) for a useful summary of the terminological issues'.)","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, &quot;text planning&quot; will always be used in the narrow sense of &quot;content selection and organization&quot;.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
The architecture of Joyce is directly influenced by that of the SEMSYN system (Rosner 1987; Wisner 1988).,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Rosner divides the realization component into two parts, the &quot;generator kernel&quot; and the &quot;generator front end&quot;.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
This distinction is mirrored exactly by the distinction between sentence planning and realization in Joyce.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"There are two main advantages to such a tripartite architecture, one conceptual and the other practical.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Conceptually, the advantage is that linguistic planning tasks are clearly separated from the actual grammar, which comprises word order and morphological rules.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
These rules can be stated independently of the formulation of purely semantic rules that determine lexical and syntactic choices.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
This modularity makes the system more maintainable.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"The linguistic planning tasks should, however, be clearly separated from the textual planning tasks: while the linguistic planning tasks are languagedependent, the textual planning tasks appear not to be2.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
1Note that the tasks Meteer groups together as &quot;Syntax&quot; - choosing the syntactic structure and linearization - are inseparable only in certain syntactic representations.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"In Joyce, the Deep-Syntactic Representation encodes syntactic structure but not linear order (see Section 6 for details).","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
2We are not aware of any example in which different text plans (as defined here) are needed for different languages.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
The fact that functionally similar texts may display different structures in different cultures should not be confused with language-specific constraints on text structure.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, if multi-lingual generation is desired, text planning and sentence planning ought to be performed by distinct components.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"On a more practical level, modularity in design and implementation can be exploited by parallel processing of independent modules.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"While the current implementations of Joyce do not allow for parallel execution, the incremental processing of parallel computing tasks on a serial machine is also advantageous, as is argued in the WIP project (Wahlster et al 1991; Harbusch et al 1991)3.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
Incrementality reduces the initial response time of the system (though not the overall processing time).,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
This can be crucial if multi-paragraph text is to be generated by an interface tool.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"In the Joyce system, the text planner cedes control to the sentence planner as soon as the text planner has defined a proposition.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Once the sentence planner has constructed the DSyntR of a complete sentence, it sends it to the realizer which generates the English sentence.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, the first sentence is output by Joyce shortly after the text generator is invoked; text continues to be output approximately at reading speed.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"The effect is that a user of the text generator has the impression that he or she never has to wait for the system to respond, even when it is generating lengthy texts.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Throughout the system, processing is message-driven in the sense of (McDonald et al 1987): control lies in the input, which is used to construct the next level of representation.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
There is no need for backtracking or feedback from one level of processing to an earlier one.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"As is argued by McDonald et al., such an architecture contributes to processing efficiency.","{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
We will now discuss the three modules of Joyce in more detail.,"{'title': '3 The Structure of Joyce', 'number': '3'}"
"Prior to the design of the text planning component of Joyce, several existing approaches were studied.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"Since the structure of the descriptive text (Figure 2) does not mirror the structure of the domain, Paris's &quot;procedural strategy&quot; (Paris and McKeown 1987) cannot be used in general.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"Hovy's RST-based planner (Hovy 1988) assumes that content selection has already been performed, contrary to the situation in the Ulysses application; furthermore, there are efficiency problems in a pure STRIPS-like planning paradigm.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
We therefore found McKeown's schema-based approach (McKeown 1985) to be the most promising.,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"However, it turned out that general rhetorical schemas cannot adequately capture the structure of the intended texts.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In (Kittredge et al 1991), we argue that planning certain types of texts - such as reports and descriptions - requires domain-specific knowledge about how to communicate in that domain.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
That knowledge we call &quot;domain communication knowledge&quot; (DCK).,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, in describing secure system designs 3Incrementality within the realizer has little practical benefit when the realizer is reasonably fast; its study is mainly motivated by psycholinguistic considerations.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"Therefore, there was no attempt in Joyce to make the realizer incremental. you must relate the security level of each component, but not, say, the number of ports or their security levels.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"Furthermore, the connectivity of components should be stated before their functionality.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In the flow analyzer text, the security levels of the components need not be communicated at all, but if a component (other than the final component of the path) downgrades information, it must be stated whether and why the component is secure.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
This very precise knowledge about which domain information needs to communicated and in what order cannot simply be derived from general principles.,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"We have also argued that in many existing text planning systems, such DCK has been encoded implicitly.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In the interest of efficiency, modularity and portability we have decided to represent DCK explicitly in Joyce.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"We have developed a &quot;schema language&quot; for easy representation of DCK, called DICKENS (DomaIn Communication Knowledge ENcoding Schemas).","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
The schemas are similar in form to those used by McKeown.,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"Basically, schemas can be seen as a description of text structure.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"The system, however, interprets each schema as a list of instructions.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"The instructions can be calls to other schemas, recursive calls to the same schema, or they can be one of a set of special commands provided by the schema language.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
One special command produces a specific proposition and sends it to the sentence planner.,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
Other special commands support conditional branching and iteration.,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"During execution, each schema is associated with a particular subset of the domain representation, which is called the focus (in the sense of McKeown's &quot;global focus&quot;).","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In the Ulysses application, the focus always corresponds to one component.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
There are special commands to shift the focus.,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In addition to the focus, which limits the domain representation from which information can be communicated, a theme can be set which determines information structure within individual propositions.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
The theme corresponds to McKeown's &quot;local focus&quot;.,"{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"As has been widely recognized, thematic structure affects issues such as grammatical voice at the linguistic level.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In addition, two further special commands were found to be necessary in order to perform text planning: This type of revision is different from the revision discussed in (Gabriel 1988) and (Meteer 1991).","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In these systems, the linguistic specification of the target texts is revised.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"In Joyce, it is the text plan itself, i.e. the pre-linguistic representation of text content and structure, that is subject to revision.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
"Instead of being templates that limit the structure of the text to certain preconceived types, the schemas are now an explicit and compact representation of domain communication knowledge.","{'title': '4 The Text Planner', 'number': '4'}"
The sentence planner combines all those planning tasks that are specific to the target language.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
It receives propositions from the text planner and sends the DSyntR of complete sentences to the realizer for processing.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"It has two main tasks: first, it chooses lexical and syntactic realizations by consulting the Conceptual/English dictionary; second, it determines sentence scope by merging the DSyntR of individual propositions.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
We will discuss each of these steps in turn.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The Conceptual/English dictionary is implemented as a set of procedures that operate on the propositions.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"Each proposition is mapped into the DSyntR of a clause (i.e., its root is a verb).","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
Lexicalization can take pragmatic factors into account.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
It can also refer to a history of lexicalizations if lexical variation is desired.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"After a DSyntR has been constructed, certain syntactic paraphrase operations are performed if necessary, for example passivization if a grammatical object is the theme of the sentence, or if the subject is absent.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The second task of the sentence planner is to determine the scope of sentences.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
Combining the linguistic realization of propositions into larger sentences is a crucial issue because it increases the quality of the generated text.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, The low-level Address Register and the multilevel Locator are data-bases (from the Host text in Figure 2) is significantly better than the four clauses from which it was formed: The Address Register is a data-base.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
It is low-level.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The Locator is a data-base.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
It is multilevel.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
An informal study in which subjects were asked to revise a (grammatical) text containing only single-proposition sentences supported the claim that longer sentences are preferred over shorter ones whenever possible and reasonable.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The first question that arises is at what level propositions should be combined.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"To date, the issue of sentence scoping has always been dealt with at a pre-linguistic, conceptual level (e.g.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
(Dale 1988) or (Carcagno and Iordanskaja 1989)).,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"However, different languages have different syntactic means of combining clauses; clause combining must refer to the specific linguistic resources of the target language.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, in Joyce the task is performed by the sentence planner rather than the text planner'.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"Joyce performs the following syntactic clausecombining operations: Relative clause formation, adjectival attachment (the process by which an adjective from a copula-construction is embedded in an NP), and conjunction.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"Conjunction includes multiple conjunctions of more than one clause, and may lead to elision of repeated sentence elements (&quot;conjunction reduction&quot;).","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, in the example quoted above, the lexeme data base occurs only once in the conjoined sentence.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The second question that arises is how clause combination should be restricted.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
We have identified stylistic and discourse constraints.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"The stylistic constraints are constraints against the sentence becoming too long (an upper bound on the number of clauses that can be combined into one sentence), and a constraint on recursive embedding of relative clauses.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
Discourse constraints are imposed by the structure of the text: clauses belonging to conceptually distinct text units should not be combined.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"The text planner can send a special message, called conceptual-break, to the sentence planner.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
It signals the beginning of a new textual unit.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
These special messages are triggered by appropriate indications in the DICKENS specifcation of the DCK.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The algorithm is as follows.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The sentence planner maintains a &quot;current&quot; DSyntR.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"Each incoming proposition is translated into a DSyntR, which the sentence planner then attempts to merge with the current DSyntR.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"If none of the clause combination strategies work, or if stylistic heuristics interfere, or if the incoming proposition is a conceptual-break, the current DSyntR is sent to the realizer and the new DSyntR becomes the current one.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
The process of clause combination can be very easily modeled at the DSyntR level: relative clause formation and conjunction reduce to simple tree composition operations.,"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
(In the case of adjectival attachment only the adjective node is attached.),"{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"Issues such as word order in relative clauses, the morphological form of the complementizer, and conjunction reduction can be dealt with at further stages of processing.","{'title': '5 The Sentence Planner', 'number': '5'}"
"The linguistic component is based on Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel'euk 1988), and is a reimplementation (in Lisp) of Polguere's Prolog implementation of a Meaning-Text model for English (Iordanskaja et al 1988; Iordanskaja et al 1991).","{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
MTT defines three successive levels of representation.,"{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
With each level of representation is associated a component which transforms the representation into the next higher level.,"{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
Each component is implemented as a separate module in Joyce. words of a sentence.,"{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
Sister nodes are unordered with respect to each other.,"{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
The nodes are labelled with lexemes which are annotated with features.,"{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
"Numerical arc labels represent the syntactic arguments of the governing lexeme, while ATTR represents the attributive relation.","{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
An example is shown in Figure 6.,"{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
"Note that the function words the, is, to are not yet represented. the written form of the English sentence.","{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
Morphological processing is done by a component closely based on SUTRA-S (Emele and Momma 1985).,"{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
"While linguistic realizers based on other theories coulc have been used, this MTT-based approach offers the following advantages:","{'title': '6 The Linguistic Realizer', 'number': '6'}"
"As an example, consider the sample text in Figure 4.","{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
I describes the occurrence of an insecure flow in compo nent Black Box.,"{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
"The texts that explain insecure flow are generated by a set of eight schemas, one of which i shown in Figure 7.","{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
It is the first that is invoked.,"{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
Special commands are preceded by a colon; command not starting with a colon are calls to other schema.s The arguments to special commands immediately follow the command.,"{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
The :title special command generates a title.,"{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
"Command :theme sets the initial theme of the paragraph, influencing issues such as passivization.","{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
"Then follow three :make-propos it ion commands, which each produce one proposition.","{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
The first argument to :make-proposition is the class of the proposition.,"{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
"The slots are typically filled with pointers into the domain representation of the application program. focus is a pointer maintained by the text planner which refers to the global focus (currently the component Black Box, represented by pointer #<COMPONENT Black Box>), while get-information and entry-port are functions provided by the underlying application program.","{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
Not all arguments must be filled by a :make-proposition command; the sentence planner will choose lexical and syntactic realizations accordingly.,"{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
"The text planner sends an insecure-flow proposition to the sentence planner, which translates it into a DSyntR tree (which represents the clause In the Black Box an insecure flow occurs) and returns control to the text planner.","{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
"The text planner then proceeds to the next :make-proposition command, and sends the proposition shown in Figure 8 to the sentence planner.","{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
When the sentence planner re,"{'title': '7 An Example', 'number': '7'}"
"ceives the enter proposition, it translates it into the DSyntR tree shown in Figure 9, which could be expressed as the clause information enters the Black Box through P6.","{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
"Note that the choice of enter as verb is due to the fact that information is currently the theme; if Black Box were the theme, the choice would have been receives.","{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
The sentence planner then tries to combine the new DSyntR with the current one (which was derived from the previous proposition).,"{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
"This fails (since the two clauses have different verbs and different actants), so the current DSyntR is sent to the realizer, which prints out the first sentence.","{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
The new DSyntR becomes the current one.,"{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
"Control is returned to the text planner, which processes the third :make-propos it ion command and sends the appropriate proposition to the sentence planner.","{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
The sentence planner generates the clausal DSyntR tree shown in Figure 10 (the information is classified).,"{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
"It then attempts to combine the new clause with the &quot;current DSyntR&quot;, first using the adjectival attachment strategy.","{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"
"This succeeds, yielding the tree shown in Figure 11.","{'title': 'ENTER AGENT #<information> OBJECT INCOMPONENT Black Box> LOCATION #<PORT P9>', 'number': '8'}"

Joyce was originally designed to generate only component descriptions (as in Figure 2).,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"The &quot;flow analyzer&quot; heuristic tool was added later to the system, and the completely different type of text it required was a first successful test of Joyce and its text planner in particular.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
The modular design of Joyce proved beneficial during the porting to the new application.,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
The following conceptually well-defined tasks were required during the development of the &quot;flow analyzer&quot; application: 1.,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"Since the flow analyzer is a new type of tool, no corpus of texts was available for study.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"Instead, sample texts were written by hand and critiqued by domain experts.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
The texts were then revised and resubmitted to the experts.,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
The &quot;ideal text&quot; that emerged was then analyzed and the DCK needed to generate it expressed in terms of schemas.,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"We interpret the cycle of writing, critiquing and revising as a process of DCK acquisition.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"

New classes of proposition were defined.,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"

"Some of the proposition classes from the earlier descriptive application could be reused, such as send.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"

The Conceptual/English dictionary was extended to account for the new proposition classes.,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"

Several new lexical items were entered into the English lexicon.,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"For example, the English lexeme downgrade subcategorizes for two nouns and a propositional phrase obligatorily headed by to.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
Note that those parts of Joyce that deal with facts of English (including clause combination) needed no attention (other than updating the lexicon).,"{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"We are currently working on porting a successor of Joyce to several new applications, including the generation of project management reports.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"Initial results, including a prototype, are encouraging.","{'title': '8 Porting the System', 'number': '9'}"
"We are aware of several shortcomings of Joyce, which we will address in future versions of the system. ple in text planning, it appears to play an important role as a constraint on possible text structures.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
"Furthermore, it helps determine the use of connectives between rhetorically related clauses.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
"Finally, it may determine when conceptual breaks occur in text structure which affect sentence scoping (Scott and de Souza 1990).","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
We are currently investigating the option of augmenting the DCK schemas with rhetorical annotations.,"{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
"• The current form of the Conceptual/English dictionary is not satisfactory, since the dictionary writer is too free in writing dictionary entries.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
"For example, the dictionary could be used as a back door for the introduction of new content which the text planner was (for whatever reasons) unable to plan.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
"Meteer discusses the same problem in McKeown's original TEXT system (Meteer 1990, p.35).","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
An interface to the dictionary that is more restrictive is needed.,"{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
"• While it is possible to set a theme in the text plan, thematic structure has not received sufficient attention.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
"Rules of thematic progression (as implemented, for instance, in McKeown's TEXT) are not taken into consideration.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"

"Despite these shortcomings, Joyce has proven to be a successful and useful tool in the Ulysses user interface.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '10'}"
