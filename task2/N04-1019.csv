We present an empirically grounded method for evaluating content selection in summarization.,{}
It incorporates the idea that no single best model summary for a collection of documents exists.,{}
Our method quantifies the relative importance of facts to be conveyed.,{}
"We argue that it is reliable, predictive and diagnostic, thus improves considerably over the shortcomings of the human evaluation method currently used in the Document Understanding Conference.",{}
Evaluating content selection in summarization has proven to be a difficult problem.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our approach acknowledges the fact that no single best model summary exists, and takes this as a foundation rather than an obstacle.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In machine translation, the rankings from the automatic BLEU method (Papineni et al., 2002) have been shown to correlate well with human evaluation, and it has been widely used since and has even been adapted for summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2003).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"To show that an automatic method is a reasonable approximation of human judgments, one needs to demonstrate that these can be reliably elicited.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, in contrast to translation, where the evaluation criterion can be defined fairly precisely it is difficult to elicit stable human judgments for summarization (Rath et al., 1961) (Lin and Hovy, 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our approach tailors the evaluation to observed distributions of content over a pool of human summaries, rather than to human judgments of summaries.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Our method involves semantic matching of content units to which differential weights are assigned based on their frequency in a corpus of summaries.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This can lead to more stable, more informative scores, and hence to a meaningful content evaluation.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We create a weighted inventory of Summary Content Units–a pyramid–that is reliable, predictive and diagnostic, and which constitutes a resource for investigating alternate realizations of the same meaning.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"No other evaluation method predicts sets of equally informative summaries, identifies semantic differences between more and less highly ranked summaries, or constitutes a tool that can be applied directly to further analysis of content selection.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 2, we describe the DUC method.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 3 we present an overview of our method, contrast our scores with other methods, and describe the distribution of scores as pyramids grow in size.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We compare our approach with previous work in Section 4.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Section 5, we present our conclusions and point to our next step, the feasibility of automating our method.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A more detailed account of the work described here, but not including the study of distributional properties of pyramid scores, can be found in (Passonneau and Nenkova, 2003).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Within DUC, different types of summarization have been studied: the generation of abstracts and extracts of different lengths, single- and multi-document summaries, and summaries focused by topic or opinion.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"Evaluation involves comparison of a peer summary (baseline, or produced by human or system) by comparing its content to a gold standard, or model.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"In 2003 they provided four human summaries for each of the 30 multi-document test sets, any one of which could serve as the model, with no criteria for choosing among possible models.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
The four human summaries for each of the 2003 document sets made our study possible.,"{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"As described in Section 3, we used three of these sets, and collected six additional summaries per set, in order to study the distribution of content units across increasingly many summaries.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
The procedure used for evaluating summaries in DUC is the following: The final score is based on the content unit coverage.,"{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"In the official DUC results tables, the score for the entire summary is the average of the scores of all the content model units, thus a number between 0 and 1.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"Some participants use slightly modified versions of the coverage metric, where the proportion of marked peer units to the number of model units is factored in.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"The selection of units with the same content is facilitated by the use of the Summary Evaluation Environment (SEE)2 developed at ISI, which displays the model and peer summary side by side and allows the user to make selections by using a mouse.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
There are numerous problems with the DUC human evaluation method.,"{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
The use of a single model summary is one of the surprises – all research in summarization evaluation has indicated that no single good model exists.,"{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"Also, since not much agreement is expected between two summaries, many model units will have no counterpart in the peer and thus the expected scores will necessarily be rather low.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"Additionally, the task of determining the percentage overlap between two text units turns out to be difficult to annotate reliably – (Lin and Hovy, 2002) report that humans agreed with their own prior judgment in only 82% of the cases.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
These methodological anomalies lead to unreliable scores.,"{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
Human-written summaries can score as low as 0.1 while machine summaries can score as high as 0.5.,"{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"For each of the 30 test sets, three of the four humanwritten summaries and the machine summaries were scored against the fourth human model summary: each human was scored on ten summaries.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"Figure 1 shows a scatterplot of human scores for all 30 sets, and illustrates an apparently random relation of summarizers to each other, and to document sets.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
This suggests that the DUC scores cannot be used to distinguish a good human summarizer from a bad one.,"{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition, the DUC method is not powerful enough to distinguish between systems.","{'title': '2 Current Approach: the Document Understanding Conference', 'number': '2'}"
"Our analysis of summary content is based on Summarization Content Units, or SCUs and we will now proceed to define the concept.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
SCUs emerge from annotation of a corpus of summaries and are not bigger than a clause.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Rather than attempting to provide a semantic or functional characterisation of what an SCU is, our annotation procedure defines how to compare summaries to locate the same or different SCUs.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The following example of the emergence of two SCUs is taken from a DUC 2003 test set.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The sentences are indexed by a letter and number combination, the letter showing which summary the sentence came from and the number indicating the position of the sentence within its respective summary.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
A1 In 1998 two Libyans indicted in 1991 for the Lockerbie bombing were still in Libya.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"B1 Two Libyans were indicted in 1991 for blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"C1 Two Libyans, accused by the United States and Britain of bombing a New York bound Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people, for 10 years were harbored by Libya who claimed the suspects could not get a fair trail in America or Britain.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
D2 Two Libyan suspects were indicted in 1991.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The annotation starts with identifying similar sentences, like the four above, and then proceeds with finer grained inspection that can lead to identifying more tightly related subparts.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
We obtain two SCUs from the underlined portions of the sentences above.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Each SCU has a weight corresponding to the number of summaries it appears in; SCU1 has weight=4 and SCU2 has weight=33: 3The grammatical constituents contributing to an SCU are bracketed and coindexed with the SCU ID.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The remaining parts of the four sentences above end up as contributors to nine different SCUs of different weight and granularity.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Though we look at multidocument summaries rather than single document ones, SCU annotation otherwise resembles the annotation of factoids in (Halteren and Teufel, 2003); as they do with factoids, we find increasing numbers of SCUs as the pool of summaries grows.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For our 100 word summaries, we find about 3440 distinct SCUs across four summaries; with ten summaries this number grows to about 60.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
A more complete comparison of the two approaches follows in section 4.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"An SCU consists of a set of contributors that, in their sentential contexts, express the same semantic content.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"An SCU has a unique index, a weight, and a natural language label.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The label, which is subject to revision throughout the annotation process, has three functions.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"First, it frees the annotation process from dependence on a semantic representation language.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, it requires the annotator to be conscious of a specific meaning shared by all contributors.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Third, because the contributors to an SCU are taken out of context, the label serves as a reminder of the full in-context meaning, as in the case of SCU2 above where the temporal PPs are about a specific event, the time of the indictment.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Our impression from consideration of three SCU inventories is that the pattern illustrated here between SCU1 and SCU2 is typical; when two SCUs are semantically related, the one with the lower weight is semantically dependent on the other.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We have catalogued a variety of such relationships, and note here that we believe it could prove useful to address semantic interdependencies among SCUS in future work that would involve adding a new annotation layer.4 However, in our approach, SCUs are treated as independent annotation values, which has the advantage of affording a rigorous analysis of interannotator reliability (see following section).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We do not attempt to represent the subsumption or implicational relations that Halteren and Teufel assign to factoids (Halteren and Teufel, 2003).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"After the annotation procedure is completed, the final SCUs can be partitioned in a pyramid.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The partition is based on the weight of the SCU; each tier contains all and only the SCUs with the same weight.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"When we use annotations from four summaries, the pyramid will contain four tiers.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"SCUs of weight 4 are placed in the top tier and SCUs of weight 1 on the bottom, reflecting the fact that fewer SCUs are expressed in all summaries, more in three, and so on.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For the mid-range tiers, neighboring tiers sometimes have the same number of SCUs.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"In descending tiers, SCUs become less important informationally since they emerged from fewer summaries.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
We use the term “pyramid of order n” to refer to a pyramid with n tiers.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Given a pyramid of order n, we can predict the optimal summary content–it should contain all the SCUs from the top tier, if length permits, SCUs from the next tier and so on.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"In short, an SCU from tier (n − 1) should not be expressed if all the SCUs in tier n have not been expressed.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"This characterization of optimal content ignores many complicating factors (e.g., ordering, SCU interdependency).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"However, it is predictive: among summaries produced by humans, many seem equally good without having identical content.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Figure 2, with two SCUs in the uppermost tier and four in the next, illustrates two of six optimal summaries of size 4 (in SCUs) that this pyramid predicts.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The score we assign is a ratio of the sum of the weights of its SCUs to the sum of the weights of an optimal summary with the same number of SCUs.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating that relatively more of the content is as highly weighted as possible.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The exact formula we use is computed as follows.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Suppose the pyramid has n tiers, Ti, with tier Tn on top and Tl on the bottom.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The weight of SCUs in tier Ti will be i.5 Let |Ti |denote the number of SCUs in tier Ti.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Let Di be the number of SCUs in the summary that appear in Ti.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
SCUs in a summary that do not appear in the pyramid are assigned weight zero.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The total SCU weight D is: The optimal content score for a summary with X SCUs is: In the equation above, j is equal to the index of the lowest tier an optimally informative summary will draw from.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
This tier is the first one top down such that the sum of its cardinality and the cardinalities of tiers above it is greater than or equal to X (summary size in SCUs).,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, if X is less than the cardinality of the most highly weighted tier, then j = n and Max is simply X xn (the product of X and the highest weighting factor).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Then the pyramid score P is the ratio of D to Max.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Because P compares the actual distribution of SCUs to an empirically determined weighting, it provides a direct correlate of the way human summarizers select information from source texts.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We aimed for an annotation method requiring relatively little training, and with sufficient interannotator reliability to produce a stable pyramid score.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Here we present results indicating good interannotator reliability, and pyramid scores that are robust across annotations.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"SCU annotation involves two types of choices: extracting a contributor from a sentence, and assigning it to an SCU.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"In a set of four summaries about the Philippine Airlines (PAL), two coders (C1 and C2; the co-authors) differed on the extent of the following contributor: {Crafter 1C2the ground crew union turned down a settlement}Cr which}C2.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Our approach is to separate syntactic from semantic agreement, as in (Klavans et al., 2003).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Because constituent structure is not relevant here, we normalize all contributors before computing reliability.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We treat every word in a summary as a coding unit, and the SCU it was assigned to as the coding value.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We require every surface word to be in exactly one contributor, and every contributor to be in exactly one SCU, thus an SCU annotation constitutes a set of equivalence classes.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Computing reliability then becomes identical to comparing the equivalence classes constituting a set of coreference annotations.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"In (Passonneau, 2004), we report our method for computing reliability for coreference annotations, and the use of a distance metric that allows us to weight disagreements.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Applying the same data representation and reliability formula (Krippendorff’s Alpha) as in (Passonneau, 2004), and a distance metric that takes into account relative SCU size, to the two codings C1 and C2 yields α = 81.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Values above .67 indicate good reliability (Krippendorff, 1980).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"More important than interannotator reliability is the robustness of the pyramid metric, given different SCU annotations.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Table 1 gives three sets of pyramid scores for the same set of four PAL summaries.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The rows of scores correspond to the original annotations (C1, C2) and a consensus.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"There is no significant difference in the scores assigned across the three annotations (between subjects ANOVA=0.11, p=0.90).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Here we use three DUC 2003 summary sets for which four human summaries were written.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"In order to provide as broad a comparison as possible for the least annotation effort, we selected the set that received the highest DUC scores (D30042: Lockerbie), and the two that received the lowest (D31041: PAL; D31050: China).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For each set, we collected six new summaries from advanced undergraduate and graduate students with evidence of superior verbal skills; we gave them the same instructions used by NIST.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
This turned out to be a large enough corpus to investigate how many summaries a pyramid needs for score stability.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Here we first compare pyramid scores of the original summaries with DUC scores.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Then we present results demonstrating the need for at least five summaries per pyramid, given this corpus of 100-word summaries.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Table 2 compares DUC and pyramid scores for all three sets.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The first two rows of pyramid scores are for a pyramid of order 3 using a single pyramid with the remaining three original DUC summaries (n=3) versus an where j = max( i average over all order-3 pyramids (Avg. n=3); the third row of pyramid scores are for the single pyramid of order 9 (n=9; note that the 10th summary is the one being scored).,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Compared to the DUC scores, pyramid scores show all humans performing reasonably well.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"While the Lockerbie set summaries are better overall, the difference with the PAL and China sets scores is less great than with the DUC method, which accords with our impressions about the relative quality of the summaries.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that pyramid scores are higher for larger pyramid inventories, which reflects the greater likelihood that more SCUs in the summary appear in the pyramid.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For a given order pyramid, the scores for the average and for a specific pyramid can differ significantly, as, for example, PAL A and PAL J do (compare rows n=3 and n=9).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The pyramid rows labelled ”n=3” are the most comparable to the DUC scores in terms of the available data.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For the DUC scores there was always a single model, and no attempt to evaluate the model.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Pyramid scores are quantitatively diagnostic in that they express what proportion of the content in a summary is relatively highly weighted, or alternatively, what proportion of the highly weighted SCUs appear in a summary.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The pyramid can also serve as a qualitative diagnostic tool.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"To illustrate both points, consider the PAL A summary; its score in the n=3 row of .76 indicates that relatively much of its content is highly weighted.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"That is, with respect to the original pyramid with only three tiers, it contained a relatively high proportion of the top tier SCUs: 3/4 of the w=3 facts (75%).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"When we average over all order-3 pyramids (Avg. n=3) or use the largest pyramid (n=9), the PAL A score goes down to .46 or .52, respectively.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Given the nine-tier pyramid, PAL A contains only 1/3 of the SCUs of w≥6, a much smaller proportion of the most highly weighted ones.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"There are four missing highly weighted SCUs and they express the following facts: to deal with its financial crisis, Pal negotiated with Cathay Pacific for help; the negotiations collapsed; the collapse resulted in part from PAL’s refusal to cut jobs; and finally, President Estrada brokered an agreement to end the shutdown strike.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
These facts were in the original order-3 pyramid with relatively lower weights.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The score variability of PAL A, along with the change in status of SCUs from having low weights to having high ones, demonstrates that to use the pyramid method reliably, we need to ask how many summaries are needed to produce rankings across summaries that we can have confidence in.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
We now turn to this analysis.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Here we address two questions raised by the data from Table 2, i.e., that scores change as pyramid size increases: To have confidence in relative ranking of summaries by pyramid scores, we need to answer the above questions.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"It has often been noted that different people write different summaries; we observe that with only a few summaries in a pyramid, there is insufficient data for the scores associated with a pyramid generated from one combination of a few summaries to be relatively the same as those using a different combination of a few summaries.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Empirically, we observed that as pyramids grow larger, and the range between higher weight and lower weight SCUS grows larger, scores stabilize.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
This makes sense in light of the fact that a score is dominated by the higher weight SCUS that appear in a summary.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"However, we wanted to study more precisely at what point scores become independent of the choice of models that populate the pyramid.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
We conducted three experiments to locate the point at which scores stabilize across our three datasets.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Each experiment supports the same conclusion, thus reinforcing the validity of the result.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Our first step in investigating score variability was to examine all pairs of summaries where the difference in scores for an order 9 pyramid was greater than 0.1; there were 68 such pairs out of 135 total.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
All such pairs exhibit the same pattern illustrated in Figure 3 for two summaries we call ’b’ and ’q’.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The x-axis on the plot shows how many summaries were used in the pyramid and the y-axis shows the min, max and average score scores for the summaries for a given order of pyramid, 6 Of the two, ’b’ has the higher score for the order 9 pyramid, and is perceivably more informative.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Averaging over all order1 pyramids, the score of ’b’ is higher than ’q’ but some individual order-1 pyramids might yield a higher score for ’q’.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The score variability at order-1 is huge: it can be as high as 0.5.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"With higher order pyramids, scores stabilize.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Specifically, in our data, if summaries diverge at some point as in Figure 3, where the minimum score for the better summary is higher than the maximum score for the worse summary, the size of the divergence never decreases as pyramid order increases.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For pyramids of order > 4, the chance that ’b’ and ’q’ reverse ranking approaches zero.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For all pairs of divergent summaries, the relationship of scores follows the same pattern we see in Figure 3 and the point of divergence where the scores for one summary become consistently higher than those of the othere, was found to be stable – in all pair instances, if summary A gets higher scores than summary B for all pyramids of order n, than A gets higher scores for pyramids of order > n. We analyzed the score distributions for all 67 pairs of ”divergent” summaries in order to determine what order of pyramid is required to reliably discriminate them.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The expected value for the point of divergence of scores, in terms of number of summaries in the pyramid, is 5.5.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We take the scores assigned at order 9 pyramids as being a reliable metric on the assumption that the pattern we have observed in our data is a general one, namely that variance always decreases with increasing orders of pyramid, and that once divergence of scores occurs, the better summary never gets a lower score than the worse for any model of higher order.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
We postulate that summaries whose scores differ by less than 0.06 have roughly the same informativeness.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The assumption is supported by two facts.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"First, this corresponds to the difference in PAL scores (D31041) we find when we use a different one of our three PAL annotations (see Table 1).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, the pairs of summaries whose scores never clearly diverged had scores differing by less than 0.06 at pyramid order 9.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Now, for each pair of summaries (sum1, sum2), we can say whether they are roughly the same when evaluated against a pyramid of order n and we will denote this as |sum1 |==n |sum2|, (scores differ by less than 0.06 for some pyramid of order n) or different (scores differ by more than 0.06 for all pyramids of order n) and we will use the notation |sum1 |<n |sum2 |if the score for sum2 is higher.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"When pyramids of lower order are used, the following errors can happen, with the associated probabilities: E1: |sum1 |==9 |sum2 |but |sum1 |<n |sum2 |or |sum1 |>n |sum2 |at some lower order n pyramid.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The conditional probability of this type of error is E2: |sum1 |<9 |sum2 |but at a lower order |sum1 |==n |sum2|.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"This error corresponds to ”losing ability to discern”, which means one can tolerate it, as long as the goal is not be able to make fine grained distinctions between the summaries.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Here, |sum2||sum1 |>n |sum2|).","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"This is the most severe kind of mistake and ideally it should never happen–the two summaries appear with scores opposite to what they really are.7 The probabilities p1, p2 and p3 can be computed directly by counting how many times the particular error occurs for all possible pyramids of order n. By taking each pyramid that does not contain either of sum1 or sum2 and comparing the scores they are assigned, the probabilities in Table 3 are obtained.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We computed probabilities for pairs of summaries for the same set, then summed the counts for error occurrence across sets.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The order of the pyramid is shown in column n. “Data points” shows how many pyramids of a given order were examined when computing the probabilities.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The total probability of error p = p1 * P(|sum1 |==9 |sum2|) + (p2 + p3) * (1 − P(|sum1 |==9 |sum2|)) is also in Table 3.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Table 3 shows that for order-4 pyramids, the errors of type E3 are ruled out.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"At order-5 pyramids, the total probability of error drops to 0.1 and is mainly due to error E2, which is the mildest one.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Choosing a desirable order of pyramid involves balancing the two desiderata of having less data to annotate and score stability.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Our data suggest that for this corpus, 4 or 5 summaries provide an optimal balance of annotation effort with reliability.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
This is reconfirmed by our following analysis of ranking stability.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"In order to study the issue of how the pyramid scores behave when several summarizers are compared, not just two, for each set we randomly selected 5 peer summaries and constructed pyramids consisting of all possible subsets of the remaining five.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
We computed the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient for the ranking of the 5 peer summaries compared to the ranking of the same summaries given by the order-9 pyramid.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Spearman coefficent rs (Dixon and Massey, 1969) ranges from -1 to 1, and the sign of the coefficent shows whether the two rankings are correlated negatively or positively and its absolute value shows the strength of the correlation.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
The statistic rs can be used to test the hypothesis that the two ways to assign scores leading to the respective rankings are independent.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The null hypothesis can be rejected with one-sided test with level of significance α = 0.05, given our sample size N = 5, if rs ≥ 0.85.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Since there are multiple pyramids of order n < 5, we computed the average ranking coefficient, as shown in Table 4.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Again we can see that in order to have a ranking of the summaries that is reasonably close to the rankings produces by a pyramid of order n = 9, 4 or more summaries should be used.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Lin and Hovy (2003) have shown that a unigram cooccurrence statistic, computed with stop words ignored, between a summary and a set of models can be used to assign scores for a test suite that highy correlates with the scores assigned by human evaluators at DUC.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"We have illustrated in Figure 1 above that human scores on human summaries have large variance, and we assume the same holds for machine summaries, so we believe the approach is built on weak assumptions.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, their approach is not designed to rank individual summaries.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"These qualifications aside, we wanted to test whether it is possible to use their approach for assigning scores not for an entire test suite but on a per set basis.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
We computed the Spearman rank-coefficent rs for rankings assigned by computing unigram overlap and those by pyramid of order 9.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"For computing the scores, Lin’s original system was used, with stop words ignored.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Again 5 summaries were chosen at random to be evaluated against models composed of the remaining five summaries.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Composite models were obtained by concatenating different combinations of the initial five summaries.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus scores can be computed using one, two and so on up to five reference summaries.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
Table 5 shows the average values of rs that were obtained.,"{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"As noted above, in order to consider the two scoring methods as being substitutable, rs should be bigger than 0.85, given our sample size.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"Given the figures shown in Table 5, we don’t have reason to believe that unigram scores are correlated with pyramid scores.","{'title': '3 The Pyramid Approach', 'number': '3'}"
"The work closest to ours is (Halteren and Teufel, 2003), and we profited from the lessons they derived from an annotation of 50 summaries of a single 600-word document into content units that they refer to as factoids.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
They found a total of 256 factoids and note that the increase in factoids with the number of summaries seems to follow a Zipfian distribution.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
We identify four important differences between factoids and SCUs.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"First, an SCU is a set of contributors that are largely similar in meaning, thus SCUs differ from each other in both meaning and weight (number of contributors).","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"In contrast, factoids are semi-formal expressions in a FOPL-style semantics, which are compositionally interpreted.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
We intentionally avoid creating a representation language for SCU labels; the function of an SCU label is to focus the annotator’s attention on the shared meaning of the contributors.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"In contrast to Haltern and Teufel, we do not believe it is possible to arrive at the correct representation for a set of summaries; they refer to the observation that the factoids arrived at depend on the summaries one starts with as a disadvantage in that adding a new summary can require adjustments to the set of factoids.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"Given the different knowledge and goals of different summarizers, we believe there can be no correct representation of the semantic content of a text or collection; a pyramid, however, represents an emergent consensus as to the most frequently recognized content.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"In addition to our distinct philosophical views regarding the utility of a factoid language, we have methodological concerns: the learning curve required to train annotators would be high, and interannotator reliability might be difficult to quantify or to achieve.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"Second, (Halteren and Teufel, 2003) do not make direct use of factoid frequency (our weights): to construct a model 100-word summary, they select factoids that occur in at least 30% of summaries, but within the resulting model summary, they do not differentiate between more and less highly weighted factoids.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"Third, they annotate semantic relations among factoids, such as generalization and implication.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"Finally, they report reliability of the annotation using recall and precision, rather than a reliability metric that factors in chance agreement.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"In (Passonneau, 2004), we note that high recall/precision does not preclude low interannotator reliability on a coreference annotation task.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
Radev et al. (2003) also exploits relative importance of information.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
Evaluation data consists of human relevance judgments on a scale from 0 to 10 on for all sentences in the original documents.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"Again, information is lost relative to the pyramid method because a unique reference summary is produced instead of using all the data.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
The reference summary consists of the sentences with highest relevance judgements that satisfy the compression constraints.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"For multidocument summarization compression rates are high, so even sentences with the highest relevance judgments are potentially not used.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
Lin and Hovy (2002) and Lin and Hovy (2003) were the first to systematically point out problems with the large scale DUC evaluation and to look to solutions by seeking more robust automatic alternatives.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
In their studies they found that multiple model summaries lead to more stable evaluation results.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
We believe a flaw in their work is that they calibrate the method to the erratic DUC scores.,"{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"When applied to per set ranking of summaries, no correlation was seen with pyramid scores.","{'title': '4 Comparison with previous work', 'number': '4'}"
"There are many open questions about how to parameterize a summary for specific goals, making evaluation in itself a significant research question (Jing et al., 1998).","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"Instead of attempting to develop a method to elicit reliable judgments from humans, we chose to calibrate our method to human summarization behavior.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"The strengths of pyramid scores are that they are reliable, predictive, and diagnostic.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"The pyramid method not only assigns a score to a summary, but also allows the investigator to find what important information is missing, and thus can be directly used to target improvements of the summarizer.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
Another diagnostic strength is that it captures the relative difficulty of source texts.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"This allows for a fair comparison of scores across different input sets, which is not the case with the DUC method.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
We hope to address two drawbacks to our method in future work.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"First, pyramid scores ignore interdependencies among content units, including ordering.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"However, our SCU annotated summaries and correlated pyramids provide a valuable data resource that will allow us to investigate such questions.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
"Second, creating an initial pyramid is laborious so large-scale application of the method would require an automated or semi-automated approach.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
We have started exploring the feasibility of automation and we are collecting additional data sets.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '5'}"
