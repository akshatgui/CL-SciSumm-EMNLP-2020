We propose a method for extracting semantic orientations of words: desirable or undesirable.,{}
"Regarding semantic orientations as spins of electrons, we use the mean field approximation to compute the approximate probability function of the system instead of the intractable actual probability function.",{}
We also propose a criterion for parameter selection on the basis of magnetization.,{}
"Given only a small number of seed words, the proposed method extracts semantic orientations with high accuracy in the experiments on English lexicon.",{}
The result is comparable to the best value ever reported.,{}
Identification of emotions (including opinions and attitudes) in text is an important task which has a variety of possible applications.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, we can efficiently collect opinions on a new product from the internet, if opinions in bulletin boards are automatically identified.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We will also be able to grasp people’s attitudes in questionnaire, without actually reading all the responds.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
An important resource in realizing such identification tasks is a list of words with semantic orientation: positive or negative (desirable or undesirable).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Frequent appearance of positive words in a document implies that the writer of the document would have a positive attitude on the topic.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The goal of this paper is to propose a method for automatically creating such a word list from glosses (i.e., definition or explanation sentences ) in a dictionary, as well as from a thesaurus and a corpus.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For this purpose, we use spin model, which is a model for a set of electrons with spins.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Just as each electron has a direction of spin (up or down), each word has a semantic orientation (positive or negative).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We therefore regard words as a set of electrons and apply the mean field approximation to compute the average orientation of each word.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

Turney and Littman (2003) proposed two algorithms for extraction of semantic orientations of words.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"To calculate the association strength of a word with positive (negative) seed words, they used the number of hits returned by a search engine, with a query consisting of the word and one of seed words (e.g., “word NEAR good”, “word NEAR bad”).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
They regarded the difference of two association strengths as a measure of semantic orientation.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
They also proposed to use Latent Semantic Analysis to compute the association strength with seed words.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"An empirical evaluation was conducted on 3596 words extracted from General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) focused on conjunctive expressions such as “simple and well-received” and “simplistic but well-received”, where the former pair of words tend to have the same semantic orientation, and the latter tend to have the opposite orientation.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
They first classify each conjunctive expression into the same-orientation class or the different-orientation class.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"

Kobayashi et al. (2001) proposed a method for extracting semantic orientations of words with bootstrapping.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"The semantic orientation of a word is determined on the basis of its gloss, if any of their 52 hand-crafted rules is applicable to the sentence.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Rules are applied iteratively in the bootstrapping framework.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Although Kobayashi et al.’s work provided an accurate investigation on this task and inspired our work, it has drawbacks: low recall and language dependency.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
They reported that the semantic orientations of only 113 words are extracted with precision 84.1% (the low recall is due partly to their large set of seed words (1187 words)).,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The handcrafted rules are only for Japanese.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Kamps et al. (2004) constructed a network by connecting each pair of synonymous words provided by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and then used the shortest paths to two seed words “good” and “bad” to obtain the semantic orientation of a word.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Limitations of their method are that a synonymy dictionary is required, that antonym relations cannot be incorporated into the model.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Their evaluation is restricted to adjectives.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
The method proposed by Hu and Liu (2004) is quite similar to the shortest-path method.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"

"Although “arrogance” is mistakingly predicted as positive due to the word “superior”, what is superior here is “manner”.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The last one is idiomatic expressions.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, although “brag” means “show off”, neither of “show” and “off” has the negative orientation.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
Idiomatic expressions often does not inherit the semantic orientation from or to the words in the gloss.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The current model cannot deal with these types of errors.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We leave their solutions as future work.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We proposed a method for extracting semantic orientations of words.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"In the proposed method, we regarded semantic orientations as spins of electrons, and used the mean field approximation to compute the approximate probability function of the system instead of the intractable actual probability function.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"We succeeded in extracting semantic orientations with high accuracy, even when only a small number of seed words are available.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
There are a number of directions for future work.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
One is the incorporation of syntactic information.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Since the importance of each word consisting a gloss depends on its syntactic role. syntactic information in glosses should be useful for classification.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Another is active learning.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"To decrease the amount of manual tagging for seed words, an active learning scheme is desired, in which a small number of good seed words are automatically selected.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"Although our model can easily extended to a multi-state model, the effectiveness of using such a multi-state model has not been shown yet.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Our model uses only the tendency of having the same orientation.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Therefore we can extract semantic orientations of new words that are not listed in a dictionary.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
The validation of such extension will widen the possibility of application of our method.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Larger corpora such as web data will improve performance.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
The combination of our method and the method by Turney and Littman (2003) is promising.,"{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"Finally, we believe that the proposed model is applicable to other tasks in computational linguistics.","{'title': '6 Conclusion and Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
