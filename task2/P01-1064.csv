We propose a statistical method that finds the maximum-probability segmentation of a given text.,{}
This method does not require training data because it estimates probabilities from the given text.,{}

An experiment showed that the method is more accurate than or at least as accurate as a state-of-the-art text segmentation system.,{}

"Identifying and isolating topics by dividing documents, which is called text segmentation, is important for many natural language processing tasks, including information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Salton et al., 1996) and summarization (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In information retrieval, users are often interested in particular topics (parts) of retrieved documents, instead of the documents themselves.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"This property is important when text segmentation is applied to information retrieval or summarization, because both tasks deal with domain-independent documents.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Another application of text segmentation is the segmentation of a continuous broadcast news story into individual stories (Allan et al., 1998).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this application, systems relying on supervised learning (Yamron et al., 1998; Beeferman et al., 1999) achieve good performance because there are plenty of training data in the domain.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"These systems, however, can not be applied to domains for which no training data exist.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

We define a topic by the distribution of words in that topic.,"{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
We assume that different topics have different word distributions.,"{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
We further assume that different topics are statistically independent of each other.,"{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
We also assume that the words within the scope of a topic are statistically independent of each other given the topic.,"{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"

Equations (5) and (6) are used in Section 3 to describe the algorithm for finding the maximumprobability segmentation. where when and are the same word and otherwise.,"{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, Our assumption, however, is that we do not have such prior information.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, we have to use some uninformative prior probability.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"We define as where bits.2 This description length is derived as follows: Suppose that there are two people, a sender and a receiver, both of whom know the text to be segmented.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"Only the sender knows the exact segmentation, and he/she should send a message so that the receiver can segment the text correctly.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"To this end, it is sufficient for the sender to send integers, i.e., , because these integers represent the lengths of segments and thus uniquely determine the segmentation once the text is known.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"A segment length can be encoded using bits, because is a number between 1 and .","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"The total description length for all the segment lengths is thus bits.3 Generally speaking, takes a large value when the number of segments is small.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"On the other hand, takes a large value when the number of segments is large.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"If only is used to segment the text, then the resulting segmentation will have too many segments.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"By using both and , we can get a reasonable number of segments.","{'title': '2 Statistical Model for Text Segmentation', 'number': '2'}"
"To find the maximum-probability segmentation , we first define the cost of segmentation as 2‘Log’ denotes the logarithm to the base 2.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
3We have used as before.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"But we use in this paper, because it is easily interpreted as a description length and the experimental results obtained by using are slightly better than those obtained by using .","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"An anonymous reviewer suggests using a Poisson distribution whose parameter is , the average length of a segment (in words), as prior probability.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"We leave it for future work to compare the suitability of various prior probabilities for text segmentation. where (12) We further rewrite Equation (12) in the form of Equation (13) below by using Equation (5) and replacing with , where is the length of words, i.e.,the number of word tokens in words.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
Equation (13) is used to describe our algorithm in Section 3.1: This section describes an algorithm for finding the minimum-cost segmentation.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"First, we define the terms and symbols used to describe the algorithm.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"Given a text consisting of words, we define as the position between and , so that is just before and is just after .","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"Next, we define a graph , where is a set of nodes and is a set of edges. is defined as can be decomposed as follows: and we then minimize to obtain , because where the edges are ordered; the initial vertex and the terminal vertex of are and , respectively.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
An example of is shown in Figure 1.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
We say that covers (16) where is the number of different words in .,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"Given these definitions, we describe the algorithm to find the minimum-cost segmentation or maximum-probability segmentation as follows: Step 2.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
Find the minimum-cost path from to .,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
Algorithms for finding the minimum-cost path in a graph are well known.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"An algorithm that can provide a solution for Step 2 will be a simpler version of the algorithm used to find the maximumprobability solution in Japanese morphological analysis (Nagata, 1994).","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, a solution can be obtained by applying a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm.4 DP algorithms have also been used for text segmentation by other researchers (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998).","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
The path thus obtained represents the minimum-cost segmentation in when edges correspond with segments.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"In Figure 1, for example, if is the minimum-cost path, then is the minimum-cost segmentation.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
The algorithm automatically determines the number of segments.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
But the number of segments can also be specified explicitly by specifying the number of edges in the minimum-cost path.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"The algorithm allows the text to be segmented anywhere between words; i.e., all the positions between words are candidates for segment boundaries.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"It is easy, however, to modify the algorithm so that the text can only be segmented at particular positions, such as the ends of sentences or paragraphs.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
This is done by using a subset of in Equation (15).,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"We use only the edges whose initial and terminal vertices are candidate boundaries that meet particular conditions, such as being the ends of sentences or paragraphs.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
We then obtain the minimum-cost path by doing Steps 1 and 2.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
The minimum-cost segmentation thus obtained meets the boundary conditions.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, we assume that the segment boundaries are at the ends of sentences.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"Generally speaking, the number of segments obtained by our algorithm is not sensitive to the length of a given text, which is counted in words.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"In other words, the number of segments is relatively stable with respect to variation in the text length.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the algorithm divides a newspaper editorial consisting of about 27 sentences into 4 to 6 segments, while on the other hand, it divides a long text consisting of over 1000 sentences into 10 to 20 segments.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, the number of segments is not proportional to text length.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
This is due to the term in Equation (11).,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
The value of this term increases as the number of words increases.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
The term thus suppresses the division of a text when the length of the text is long.,"{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"This stability is desirable for summarization, because summarizing a given text requires selecting a relatively small number of topics from it.","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"If a text segmentation system divides a given text into a relatively small number of segments, then a summary of the original text can be composed by combining summaries of the component segments (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000).","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
"A finer segmentation can be obtained by applying our algorithm recursively to each segment, if necessary.5","{'title': '3 Algorithm for Finding the', 'number': '3'}"
We used publicly available data to evaluate our system.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"This data was used by Choi (2000) to compare various domain-independent text segmentation systems.6 He evaluated (Choi, 2000), TextTiling (Hearst, 1994), DotPlot (Reynar, 1998), and Segmenter (Kan et al., 1998) by using the data and reported that achieved the best performance among these systems.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The data description is as follows: “An artificial test corpus of 700 samples is used to assess the accuracy and speed performance of segmentation algorithms.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"The sample texts were preprocessed – i.e., punctuation and stop words were removed and the remaining words were stemmed – by a program using the libraries available in Choi’s package.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The texts were then segmented by the systems listed in Tables 2 and 3.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The segmentation boundaries were placed at the ends of sentences.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The segmentations were evaluated by applying an evaluation program in Choi’s package.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

(1999).7 Low indicates high accuedges in the minimum-cost path, then the resulting segmentation often contains very small segments consisting of only one or two sentences.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"We found empirically that segments obtained by recursive segmentation were better than those obtained by minimum-cost segmentation when the specified number of segments was somewhat larger than that of the minimum-cost path, whose number of segments was automatically determined by the algorithm.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
"In these tables, the symbol “ ” indicates that the difference in between the two systems is statistically significant at the 1% level, based on “number is the probability that a randomly chosen pair of words a distance of words apart is inconsistently classified; that is, for one of the segmentations the pair lies in the same segment, while for the other the pair spans a segment boundary” (Beeferman et al., 1999), where is chosen to be half the average reference segment length (in words). ments were given beforehand. a one-sided -test of the null hypothesis of equal means.","{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"
The probability of the null hypothesis being true is displayed in the row indicated by “prob”.,"{'title': '4 Experiments', 'number': '4'}"

"Their model is basically the same as that used for HMM part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999), if we regard topics as POS tags.11 Finding topic boundaries is equivalent to finding topic transitions; i.e., a continuous topic or segment is a sequence of words with the same topic.","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
"Their approach is indirect compared with our approach, which directly finds the maximumprobability segmentation.","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
"As a result, their model can not straightforwardly incorporate features pertaining to a segment itself, such as the average length of segments.","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
"Our model, on the other hand, can incorporate this information quite naturally.","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
"Suppose that the length of a segment follows a normal distribution , with a mean of and standard deviation of (Ponte and Croft, 1997).","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
Then Equation (13) can be augmented to where .,"{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
Equation (17) favors segments whose lengths are similar to the average length (in words).,"{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
"Another major difference from their algorithm is that our algorithm does not require training data to estimate probabilities, while their algorithm does.","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, our algorithm can be applied to domain-independent texts, while their algorithm is restricted to domains for which training data are available.","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
"It would be interesting, however, to compare our algorithm with their algorithm for the case when training data are available.","{'title': '5 Discussion', 'number': '5'}"
