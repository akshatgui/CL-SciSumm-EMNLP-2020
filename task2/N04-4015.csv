We present a novel morphological analysis technique which induces a morphological and syntactic symmetry between two languages with highly asymmetrical morphological structures to improve statistical machine translation qualities.,{}
The technique pre-supposes fine-grained segmentation of a word in the morphologically rich language into sequence of and part-of-speech tagging of the parallel corpus.,{}
The algorithm to be the morphologically rich language to induce the desired morphological and syntactic symmetry.,{}
"The technique improves Arabic-to-English translation qualities significantly when applied to IBM Model 1 and Phrase Translation Models trained on the training corpus size ranging from 3,500 to 3.3 million sentence pairs.",{}
Translation of two languages with highly different morphological structures as exemplified by Arabic and English poses a challenge to successful implementation of statistical machine translation models (Brown et al. 1993).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '1'}"
Rarely occurring inflected forms of a stem in Arabic often do not accurately translate due to the frequency imbalance with the corresponding translation word in English.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '1'}"
"So called a word (separated by a white space) in Arabic often corresponds to more than one independent word in English, posing a technical problem to the source channel models.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '1'}"
"In the English-Arabic sentence alignment shown in Figure 1, Arabic word AlAHmr (written in Buckwalter transliteration) is aligned to two English words ‘the red’, and llmEArDp to three English words ‘of the opposition.’ In this paper, we present a technique to induce a morphological and syntactic symmetry between two languages with different morphological structures for statistical translation quality improvement.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '1'}"

"Arabic-English sentence alignment after Arabic word segmentation is illustrated in Figure 2, where one Arabic morpheme is aligned to one or zero English word.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '1'}"
We then apply the proposed technique to the word segmented Arabic corpus to identify prefixes/suffixes to be merged into their stems or deleted to induce a symmetrical morphological structure.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '1'}"

One major asymmetry between Arabic and English is caused by more frequent use of the determiner Al# in Arabic compared with its counterpart the in English.,"{'title': '3.', 'number': '3'}"
