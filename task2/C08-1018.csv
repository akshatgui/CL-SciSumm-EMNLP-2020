In this paper we generalise the sentence compression task.,Introduction
"Rather than sim ply shorten a sentence by deleting words or constituents, as in previous work, we rewrite it using additional operations such as substitution, reordering, and insertion.",Introduction
We present a new corpus that is suitedto our task and a discriminative tree-to tree transduction model that can naturallyaccount for structural and lexical mis matches.,Introduction
"The model incorporates a novelgrammar extraction method, uses a lan guage model for coherent output, and canbe easily tuned to a wide range of compres sion specific loss functions.",Introduction
Automatic sentence compression can be broadly described as the task of creating a grammaticalsummary of a single sentence with minimal information loss.,Experiment/Discussion
"It has recently attracted much attention, in part because of its relevance to applications.",Experiment/Discussion
"Examples include the generation of sub titles from spoken transcripts (Vandeghinste and Pan, 2004), the display of text on small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs (Corston-Oliver, 2001), and, notably, summarisation (Jing, 2000; Lin, 2003).",Experiment/Discussion
"Most prior work has focused on a specific instantiation of sentence compression, namely word deletion.",Experiment/Discussion
"Given an input sentence of words, w 1 , w 2 . . .",Experiment/Discussion
"w n , a compression is formed by dropping any subset of these words (Knight c ? 2008.",Experiment/Discussion

"and Marcu, 2002).",Experiment/Discussion
"The simplification renders the task computationally feasible, allowing efficient decoding using a dynamic program (Knight andMarcu, 2002; Turner and Charniak, 2005; McDon ald, 2006).",Experiment/Discussion
"Furthermore, constraining the problemto word deletion affords substantial modeling flexibility.",Experiment/Discussion
"Indeed, a variety of models have been successfully developed for this task ranging from in stantiations of the noisy-channel model (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Galley and McKeown, 2007;Turner and Charniak, 2005), to large-margin learn ing (McDonald, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007), and Integer Linear Programming (Clarke, 2008).",Experiment/Discussion
"However, the simplification also renders the tasksomewhat artificial.",Experiment/Discussion
"There are many rewrite operations that could compress a sentence, besides deletion, including reordering, substitution, and inser tion.",Experiment/Discussion
"In fact, professional abstractors tend to use these operations to transform selected sentences from an article into the corresponding summary sentences (Jing, 2000).",Experiment/Discussion
"Therefore, in this paper we consider sentence compression from a more general perspective and generate abstracts rather than extracts.",Experiment/Discussion
"In this framework, the goal is to find a summary of theoriginal sentence which is grammatical and conveys the most important information without necessarily using the same words in the same or der.",Experiment/Discussion
"Our task is related to, but different from, paraphrase extraction (Barzilay, 2003).",Experiment/Discussion
"We must not only have access to paraphrases (i.e., rewrite rules), but also be able to combine them in order to generate new text, while attempting to produce a shorter resulting string.",Experiment/Discussion
Quirk et al (2004) present an end-to-end paraphrasing system inspired byphrase-based machine translation that can both ac quire paraphrases and use them to generate new strings.,Experiment/Discussion
"However, their model is limited to lexical substitution ? no reordering takes place ? and is 137 lacking the compression objective.Once we move away from extractive compres sion we are faced with two problems.",Experiment/Discussion
"First, wemust find an appropriate training set for our abstractive task.",Experiment/Discussion
Compression corpora are not natu rally available and existing paraphrase corpora do not normally contain compressions.,Experiment/Discussion
Our second problem concerns the modeling task itself.,Experiment/Discussion
"Ideally, our learning framework should handle structural mismatches and complex rewriting operations.In what follows, we first present a new cor pus for abstractive compression which we created by having annotators compress sentences while rewriting them.",Experiment/Discussion
"Besides obtaining useful data formodeling purposes, we also demonstrate that ab stractive compression is a meaningful task.",Experiment/Discussion
We then present a tree-to-tree transducer capable of transforming an input parse tree into a compressed parse tree.,Experiment/Discussion
"Our approach is based on synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG, Eisner (2003)),a formalism that can account for structural mismatches, and is trained discriminatively.",Experiment/Discussion
"Specifi cally, we generalise the model of Cohn and Lapata (2007) to our abstractive task.",Experiment/Discussion
We present a noveltree-to-tree grammar extraction method which acquires paraphrases from bilingual corpora and ensure coherent output by including a ngram language model as a feature.,Experiment/Discussion
We also develop a number of loss functions suited to the abstractive compression task.,Experiment/Discussion
"We hope that some of the work described here might be of relevance to other gen eration tasks such as machine translation (Eisner, 2003), multi-document summarisation (Barzilay, 2003), and text simplification (Carroll et al, 1999).",Experiment/Discussion
A stumbling block to studying abstractive sentence compression is the lack of widely available corpora for training and testing.,Experiment/Discussion
"Previous work has beenconducted almost exclusively on Ziff-Davis, a cor pus derived automatically from document abstractpairs (Knight and Marcu, 2002), or on human authored corpora (Clarke, 2008).",Experiment/Discussion
"Unfortunately,none of these data sources are suited to our problem since they have been produced with a single rewriting operation, namely word deletion.",Experiment/Discussion
"Al though there is a greater supply of paraphrasing corpora, such as the Multiple-Translation Chinese (MTC) corpus 1 and theMicrosoft Research (MSR) Paraphrase Corpus (Quirk et al, 2004), they are also not ideal, since they have not been created 1 Available by the LDC, Catalog Number LDC2002T01, ISBN 1-58563-217-1.",Experiment/Discussion
with compression in mind.,Experiment/Discussion
"They contain amplerewriting operations, however they do not explic itly target information loss.",Experiment/Discussion
"For the reasons just described, we created our own corpus.",Experiment/Discussion
"We collected 30 newspaper articles (575 sentences) from the British National Corpus (BNC) and the American News Text corpus, forwhich we obtained manual compressions.",Experiment/Discussion
"In or der to confirm that the task was feasible, five of these documents were initially compressed by two annotators (not the authors).",Experiment/Discussion
The annotators weregiven instructions that explained the task and defined sentence compression with the aid of examples.,Experiment/Discussion
"They were asked to paraphrase while preserv ing the most important information and ensuring the compressed sentences remained grammatical.They were encouraged to use any rewriting opera tions that seemed appropriate, e.g., to delete words, add new words, substitute them or reorder them.Assessing inter-annotator agreement is notori ously difficult for paraphrasing tasks (Barzilay, 2003) since there can be many valid outputs for a given input.",Experiment/Discussion
Also our task is doubly subjective in deciding which information to remove from the sentence and how to rewrite it.,Experiment/Discussion
"In default of an agreement measure that is well suited to the task and takes both decisions into account, we assessedthem separately.",Experiment/Discussion
We first examined whether the annotators compressed at a similar level.,Experiment/Discussion
The com pression rate was 56% for one annotator and 54% for the other.,Experiment/Discussion
"2 We also assessed whether theyagreed in their rewrites by measuring BLEU (Pap ineni et al, 2002).",Experiment/Discussion
"The inter-annotator BLEU score was 23.79%, compared with the source agreement BLEU of only 13.22%.",Experiment/Discussion
Both the compression rateand BLEU score indicate that the task is welldefined and the compressions valid.,Experiment/Discussion
The remaining 25 documents were compressed by a single an notator to ensure consistency.,Experiment/Discussion
All our experiments used the data from this annotator.,Experiment/Discussion
3Table 1 illustrates some examples from our corpus.,Experiment/Discussion
"As can be seen, some sentences contain a single rewrite operation.",Experiment/Discussion
"For instance, a PP is para phrased with a genitive (see (1)), a subordinate clause with a present participle (see (2)), a passive sentence with an active one (see (3)).",Experiment/Discussion
"However, in most cases many rewrite decisions take place allat once.",Experiment/Discussion
Consider sentence (4).,Experiment/Discussion

Our work builds on the model developed by Cohnand Lapata (2007).,Experiment/Discussion
They formulate sentence compression as a tree-to-tree rewriting task.,Experiment/Discussion
"A syn chronous tree substitution grammar (STSG, Eisner (2003)) licenses the space of all possible rewrites.",Experiment/Discussion
"Each grammar rule is assigned a weight, and these weights are learnt in discriminative training.",Experiment/Discussion
"For prediction, a specialised generation algorithmfinds the best scoring compression using the grammar rules.",Experiment/Discussion
Cohn and Lapata apply this model to ex tractive compression with state-of-the-art results.,Experiment/Discussion
This model is appealing for our task for severalreasons.,Experiment/Discussion
"Firstly, the synchronous grammar provides expressive power to model consistent syntactic effects such as reordering, changes in nonterminal categories and lexical substitution.",Experiment/Discussion
"Sec ondly, it is discriminatively trained, which allowsfor the incorporation of all manner of powerful features.",Experiment/Discussion
"Thirdly, the learning framework can be tai lored to the task by choosing an appropriate loss function.",Experiment/Discussion
"In the following we describe their model in more detail with emphasis on the synchronous grammar, the model structure, and the predictionand training algorithms.",Experiment/Discussion
Section 4 presents our ex tensions and modifications.,Experiment/Discussion

The numbered boxes in the rules denote linked variables.,Experiment/Discussion
Pre-terminal categories are not shown for the output trees for the sake of brevity.,Experiment/Discussion
"tences, which we refer to henceforth as the source and target.",Experiment/Discussion
We use the grammar to find the set of sister target sentences for a given source sentence.Figure 1 shows a toy grammar and the set of possi ble target (output) trees for the given source (input)tree.,Experiment/Discussion
"Each output tree is created by applying a se ries of grammar rules, where each rule matches a fragment of the source and creates a fragment of the target tree.",Experiment/Discussion
A rule in the grammar consists of a pair of elementary trees and a mapping between the variables (frontier non-terminals) in both trees.,Experiment/Discussion
A derivation is a sequence of rules yielding a target tree with no remaining variables.,Experiment/Discussion
"Cohn and Lapata (2007) extract a STSG froma parsed, word-aligned corpus of source and target sentences.",Experiment/Discussion
"Specifically, they extract the mini mal set of synchronous rules which can describe each tree pair.",Experiment/Discussion
"These rules are minimal in the sensethat they cannot be made smaller (e.g., by replac ing a subtree with a variable) while still honouring the word-alignment.",Experiment/Discussion
Decoding The grammar allows us to search for all sister trees for a given tree.,Experiment/Discussion
"The decoder maximises over this space: y ? =argmax y:S(y)=x ?(y) (1) where ?(y) = ? r?y ??(r, S(y)), ??",Experiment/Discussion
"(2) Here x is the source (uncompressed) tree, y is a derivation which produces the source tree, S(y) = x, and a target tree, T (y), 4and r is a gram mar rule.",Experiment/Discussion
The ? function scores the derivation and 4 Equation 1 optimises over derivations rather than target trees to allow tractable inference.,Experiment/Discussion
139 is defined in (2) as a linear function over the rules used.,Experiment/Discussion
"Each rule?s score is an inner product between its feature vector, ?(r,y S), and the model parame ters, ?.",Experiment/Discussion
"The feature functions are set by hand, while the model parameters are learned in training.",Experiment/Discussion
The maximisation problem in (1) can be solved efficiently using a dynamic program.,Experiment/Discussion
Derivations will have common sub-structures whenever they transduce the same source sub-tree into a target sub-tree.,Experiment/Discussion
"This is captured in a chart, leading to an efficient bottom-up algorithm.",Experiment/Discussion
The asymptotic time complexity of this search is O(SR) where S is the number of source nodes andR is the number of rules matching a given node.,Experiment/Discussion
"Training The model is trained using SVM struct , a large margin method for structured output problems (Joachims, 2005; Tsochantaridis et al, 2005).",Experiment/Discussion
"This training method allows the use of a configurable loss function, ?(y ? ,y), whichmeasures the extent to which the model?s predic tion, y, differs from the reference, y ? .",Experiment/Discussion
Central.,Experiment/Discussion
to training is the search for a derivation which is both high scoring and has high loss compared to the gold standard.,Experiment/Discussion
5 This requires finding the maximiser of H(y) in one of: H s = (1?,Experiment/Discussion
"??(y ? )??(y), ??)?(y ? ,y) H m = ?(y ? ,y)?",Experiment/Discussion
"??(y ? )??(y), ??",Experiment/Discussion
"(3) where the subscripts s and m denote slack and margin rescaling, which are different formulations of the training problem (see Tsochantaridis et al (2005) and Taskar et al (2003) for details).",Experiment/Discussion
The search for the maximiser of H(y) in (3) requires the tracking of the loss value.,Experiment/Discussion
"This can be achieved by extending the decoding algorithmsuch that the chart cells also store the loss param eters (e.g., for precision, the number of true and false positives (Joachims, 2005)).",Experiment/Discussion
"Consequently, this extension leads to a considerably higher time and space complexity compared to decoding.",Experiment/Discussion
"For example, with precision loss the time complexity is O(S 3 R) as each step must consider O(S 2) pos sible loss parameter values.",Experiment/Discussion
In this section we present our extensions of Cohnand Lapata?s (2007) model.,Experiment/Discussion
The latter was de signed with the simpler extractive compression in mind and cannot be readily applied to our task.,Experiment/Discussion
5 Spurious ambiguity in the grammar means that there areoften many derivations linking the source and target.,Experiment/Discussion
"We fol low Cohn and Lapata (2007) by choosing the derivation with the most rules, which should provide good generalisation.",Experiment/Discussion
Grammar It is relatively straightforward to extract a grammar from our corpus.,Experiment/Discussion
"This grammar will contain many rules encoding deletions and structural transformations but there will be many unobserved paraphrases, no matter how good the extraction method (recall that our corpus consistssolely of 565 sentences).",Experiment/Discussion
"For this reason, we ex tract a grammar from our abstractive corpus in the manner of Cohn and Lapata (2007) (see Section 5for details) and augment it with a larger grammar obtained from a parallel bilingual corpus.",Experiment/Discussion
"Crucially, our second grammar will not contain com pression rules, just paraphrasing ones.",Experiment/Discussion
We leave itto the model to learn which rules serve the com pression objective.,Experiment/Discussion
"Our paraphrase grammar extraction method uses bilingual pivoting to learn paraphrases over syntax tree fragments, i.e., STSG rules.",Experiment/Discussion
Pivoting treats the paraphrasing problem as a two-stage translation process.,Experiment/Discussion
"Some English text is translated to a foreign language, and then translated back into English (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005): p(e ? |e) = ? f p(e ? |f)p(f |e) (4) where p(f |e) is the probability of translating an English string e into a foreign string f and p(e ?|f) the probability of translating the same for eign string into some other English string e ? .",Experiment/Discussion
We.,Experiment/Discussion
"thus obtain English-English translation probabili ties p(e ? |e) by marginalizing out the foreign text.Instead of using strings (Bannard and CallisonBurch, 2005), we use elementary trees on the En glish side, resulting in a monolingual STSG.",Experiment/Discussion
"Weobtain the elementary trees and foreign strings us ing the GKHM algorithm (Galley et al, 2004).",Experiment/Discussion
"This takes as input a bilingual word-aligned corpus with trees on one side, and finds the minimal set of tree fragments and their corresponding strings which is consistent with the word alignment.",Experiment/Discussion
This process is illustrated in Figure 2 where the aligned pair on the left gives rise to the rules shown onthe right.,Experiment/Discussion
Note that the English rules and for eign strings shown include variable indices where they have been generalised.,Experiment/Discussion
We estimate p(f |e) and p(e ? |f) from the set of tree-to-string rules and then then pivot each tree fragment to produce STSG rules.,Experiment/Discussion
Figure 3 illustrates the process for the [VP does not VP] fragment.,Experiment/Discussion
Modeling and Decoding Our grammar is much larger and noisier than a grammar extractedsolely for deletion-based compression.,Experiment/Discussion

lection we incorporate a ngram language model(LM) as a feature.,Experiment/Discussion
"This requires adapting the scor ing function, ?, in (2) to allow features over target ngrams: ?(y) = ? r?y ??(r, S(y)), ??+ ? m?T (y) ??(m,S(y)), ??",Experiment/Discussion
(5)where m are the ngrams and ? is a new fea ture function over these ngrams (we use only one ngram feature: the trigram log-probability).,Experiment/Discussion
"Sadly, the scoring function in (5) renders the chart-based search used for training and decoding intractable.In order to provide sufficient context to the chart based algorithm, we must also store in each chart cell the n ? 1 target tokens at the left and right edges of its yield.",Experiment/Discussion
"This is equivalent to using as our grammar the intersection between the original grammar and the ngram LM (Chiang, 2007), and increases the decoding complexity to an infeasible O(SRL 2(n?1)V )whereL is the size of the lexicon.",Experiment/Discussion
"We adopt a popular approach in syntax-inspiredmachine translation to address this problem (Chi ang, 2007).",Experiment/Discussion
The idea is to use a beam-search overthe intersection grammar coupled with the cube pruning heuristic.,Experiment/Discussion
"The beam limits the number ofitems in a given chart cell to a fixed constant, re gardless of the number of possible LM contexts and non-terminal categories.",Experiment/Discussion
"Cube-pruning furtherlimits the number of items considered for inclu sion in the beam, reducing the time complexity to a more manageable O(SRBV ) where B is the beam size.",Experiment/Discussion
We refer the interested reader to Chiang (2007) for details.,Experiment/Discussion
Training The extensions to the model in (5)also necessitate changes in the training proce dure.,Experiment/Discussion
Recall that training the basic model of Cohn and Lapata (2007) requires finding the maximiserof H(y) in (3).,Experiment/Discussion
Their model uses a chart-based al gorithm for this purpose.,Experiment/Discussion
"As in decoding we also use a beam search for training, thereby avoiding the exponential time complexity of exact search.The beam search requires an estimate of the qual ity for incomplete derivations.",Experiment/Discussion
"We use the margin rescaling objective, H m in (3), and approximatethe loss using the current (incomplete) loss param eter values in each chart cell.",Experiment/Discussion
We use a wide beam of 200 unique items or 500 items in total to reduce the impact of the approximation.,Experiment/Discussion
Our loss functions are tailored to the task anddraw inspiration from metrics developed for ex tractive compression but also for summarisation and machine translation.,Experiment/Discussion
They are based on the Hamming distance over unordered bags of items.,Experiment/Discussion
"This measures the number of predicted items that did not appear in the reference, along with a penalty for short output: ? hamming (y ? ,y) = f+max (l ?",Experiment/Discussion
"(t+ f), 0) (6) where t and f are the number of true and falsepositives, respectively, when comparing the pre dicted target, y, with the reference, y ? , and l isthe length of the reference.",Experiment/Discussion
"The second term pe nalises short output, as predicting very little or nothing would otherwise be unpenalised.",Experiment/Discussion
"We have three Hamming loss functions over: 1) tokens, 2) ngrams (n ? 3), or 3) CFG productions.",Experiment/Discussion
Theselosses all operate on unordered bags and therefore might reward erroneous predictions.,Experiment/Discussion
"For ex ample, a permutation of the reference tokens has zero token-loss.",Experiment/Discussion
"The CFG and ngram losses have overlapping items which encode a partial order, and therefore are less affected.In addition, we developed a fourth loss func tion to measure the edit distance between themodel?s prediction and the reference, both as bags of-tokens.",Experiment/Discussion
This measures the number of insertionsand deletions.,Experiment/Discussion
"In contrast to the previous loss func tions, this requires the true positive counts to be clipped to the number of occurrences of each type in the reference.",Experiment/Discussion
"The edit distance is given by: ? edit (y ? ,y) = p+ q ? 2 ? i min(p i , q i ) (7) where p and q denote the number of target tokensin the predicted and reference derivation, respec tively, and p i and q i are the counts for type i. 141 ?ADJP,NP?",Experiment/Discussion

"We give details on the corpora and grammars we used, model parameters and features, 6 the baselineused for comparison with our approach, and ex plain how our system output was evaluated.",Results/Conclusion
"Grammar Extraction Our grammar usedrules extracted directly from our compression cor pus (the training partition, 480 sentences) and a bilingual corpus (see Table 2 for examples).",Results/Conclusion
"Theformer corpus was word-aligned using the Berke ley aligner (Liang et al, 2006) initialised with a lexicon of word identity mappings, and parsed with Bikel?s (2002) parser.",Results/Conclusion
From this we extracted grammar rules following the technique described in Cohn and Lapata (2007).,Results/Conclusion
For the pivot grammarwe use the French-English Europarl v2 which con tains approximately 688K sentences.,Results/Conclusion
"Again, the corpus was aligned using the Berkeley aligner and the English side was parsed with Bikel?s parser.",Results/Conclusion
Weextracted tree-to-string rules using our implementation of the GHKM method.,Results/Conclusion
"To ameliorate the effects of poor alignments on the grammar, we re moved singleton rules before pivoting.",Results/Conclusion
"In addition to the two grammars described, wescanned the source trees in the compression cor pus and included STSG rules to copy each CFG production or delete up to two of its children.",Results/Conclusion
This is illustrated in Table 2 where the last two rules are derived from the CFG production NP?DT NN inthe source tree.,Results/Conclusion
All trees are rooted with a distinguished TOP non-terminal which allows the ex plicit modelling of sentence spanning sub-trees.,Results/Conclusion
"These grammars each had 44,199 (pivot), 7,813 (train) and 22,555 (copy) rules.",Results/Conclusion
"We took their union, resulting in 58,281 unique rules and 13,619 unique source elementary trees.",Results/Conclusion

"We also use a trigram language model trained on the BNC (100 million words) using the SRI Language Modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing.An important parameter in our modeling frame work is the choice of loss function.",Results/Conclusion
We evaluatedthe loss functions presented in Section 4 on the de velopment set.,Results/Conclusion
We ran our system for each of the four loss functions and asked two human judgesto rate the output on a scale of 1 to 5.,Results/Conclusion
"The Ham ming loss over tokens performed best with a meanrating of 3.18, closely followed by the edit dis tance (3.17).",Results/Conclusion
We chose the former over the latter as it is less coarsely approximated during search.,Results/Conclusion
Baseline There are no existing models thatcan be readily trained on our abstractive com pression data.,Results/Conclusion
"Instead, we use Cohn and Lapata?s (2007) extractive model as a baseline.",Results/Conclusion
"The latter was trained on an extractive compression corpus drawn from the BNC (Clarke, 2008) and tunedto provide a similar compression rate to our sys tem.",Results/Conclusion
"Note that their model is a strong baseline: it performed significantly better than competitive approaches (McDonald, 2006) across a variety of compression corpora.Evaluation Methodology Sentence compres sion output is commonly evaluated by eliciting human judgments.",Results/Conclusion
"Following Knight and Marcu(2002), we asked participants to rate the grammati cality of the target compressions and howwell they preserved the most important information from the source.",Results/Conclusion
In both cases they used a five pointrating scale where a high number indicates better performance.,Results/Conclusion

"In the extractive case, a word sequence is eitherdeleted or retained.",Results/Conclusion
"We may, however, want to re tain the meaning of the sequence while rendering the sentence shorter, and this is precisely what our model can achieve, e.g., by allowing substitutions.As far as grammaticality is concerned, our abstractive model is numerically better than the extrac tive baseline but the difference is not statistically significant.",Results/Conclusion
"Note that our model has to work a lotharder than the baseline to preserve grammatical ity since we allow arbitrary rewrites which maylead to agreement or tense mismatches, and selec tional preference violations.",Results/Conclusion
"The scope for errors is greatly reduced when performing solely deletions.Finally, both the abstractive and extractive out puts are perceived as significantly worse than the gold standard both in terms of grammaticalityand importance (?",Results/Conclusion
< 0.01).,Results/Conclusion
This is not surpris ing: human-authored compressions are more fluentand tend to omit genuinely superfluous informa tion.,Results/Conclusion
This is also mirrored in the compression ratesshown in Table 4.,Results/Conclusion
"When compressing, humans emO: Kurtz came from Missouri, and at the age of 14, hitch hiked to Los Angeles seeking top diving coaches.",Results/Conclusion
"E: Kurtz came from Missouri, and at 14, hitch-hiked to Los Angeles seeking top diving coaches.",Results/Conclusion
A: Kurtz hitch-hiked to Los Angeles seeking top diving coaches.,Results/Conclusion
"G: Kurtz came from Missouri, and at 14, hitch-hiked to Los Angeles seeking diving coaches.",Results/Conclusion
O: The scheme was intended for people of poor or moderate means.,Results/Conclusion
E: The scheme was intended for people of poor means.,Results/Conclusion
A: The scheme was planned for poor people.,Results/Conclusion
G: The scheme was intended for the poor.,Results/Conclusion
"O: He died last Thursday at his home from complications following a fall, said his wife author Margo Kurtz.",Results/Conclusion
"E: He died last at his home from complications following a fall, said wife, author Margo Kurtz.",Results/Conclusion
A: His wife author Margo Kurtz died from complications after a decline.,Results/Conclusion
"G: He died from complications following a fall.O: But a month ago, she returned to Britain, taking the chil dren with her.",Results/Conclusion
"E: She returned to Britain, taking the children.",Results/Conclusion
A: But she took the children with him.,Results/Conclusion
G: But she returned to Britain with the children.,Results/Conclusion
"Table 5: Compression examples including human and systemoutput (O: original sentence, E: Extractive model, A: Abstrac tive model, G: gold standard) ploy not only linguistic but also world knowledge which is not accessible to our model.",Results/Conclusion
"Although thesystem can be forced to match the human compression rate, the grammaticality and information con tent both suffer.",Results/Conclusion
More sophisticated features could allow the system to narrow this gap.,Results/Conclusion
"We next examined the output of our system inmore detail by recording the number of substitu tions, deletions and insertions it performed on the test data.",Results/Conclusion
"Deletions accounted for 67% of rewrite operations, substitutions for 27%, and insertions for 6%.",Results/Conclusion
"Interestingly, we observe a similar ratio in the human compressions.",Results/Conclusion
"Here, deletions arealso the most common rewrite operation (69%) fol lowed by substitutions (24%), and insertions (7%).",Results/Conclusion
"The ability to perform substitutions and insertions increases the compression potential of our system, but can also result in drastic meaning changes.",Results/Conclusion
In most cases (63%) the compressions produced byour system did not distort the meaning of the orig inal.,Results/Conclusion
"Humans are clearly better at this, 96.5% of their compressions were meaning preserving.",Results/Conclusion
We illustrate example output of our system in Table 5.,Results/Conclusion
For comparison we also present the gold standard compressions and baseline output.,Results/Conclusion
In thefirst sentence the system rendered Kurtz the sub ject of hitch-hiked.,Results/Conclusion
At the same time it deleted the verb and its adjunct from the first conjunct (camefrom Missouri ) as well as the temporal modi fier at the age of 14 from the second conjunct.,Results/Conclusion
"The second sentence shows some paraphrasing: the verb intended is substituted with planned and 143 poor is now modifying people rather than means.In the third example, our system applies multi ple rewrites.",Results/Conclusion
"It deletes last Thursday at his home,moves wife author Margo Kurtz to the subject position, and substitutes fall with decline.",Results/Conclusion
"Unfortu nately, the compressed sentence expresses a rather different meaning from the original.",Results/Conclusion
It is not Margo Kurtz who died but her husband.,Results/Conclusion
"Finally, our last sentence illustrates a counter-intuitive substitution, the pronoun her is rewritten as him.",Results/Conclusion
This is becausethey share the French translation lui and thus piv oting learns to replace the less common word (in legal corpora) her with him.,Results/Conclusion
This problem could be addressed by pivoting over multiple bitexts with different foreign languages.,Results/Conclusion
Possible extensions and improvements to the current model are many and varied.,Results/Conclusion
"Firstly, ashinted at above, the model would benefit from extensive feature engineering, including source con ditioned features and ngram features besides theLM.",Results/Conclusion
A richer grammar would also boost perfor mance.,Results/Conclusion
This could be found by pivoting over more bitexts in many foreign languages or making use of existing or paraphrase corpora.,Results/Conclusion
"Finally, we planto apply the model to other paraphrasing tasks in cluding fully abstractive document summarisation (Daum?e III and Marcu, 2002).",Results/Conclusion
