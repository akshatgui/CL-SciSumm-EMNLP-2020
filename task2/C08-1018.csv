In this paper we generalise the sentence compression task.,{}
"Rather than sim ply shorten a sentence by deleting words or constituents, as in previous work, we rewrite it using additional operations such as substitution, reordering, and insertion.",{}
We present a new corpus that is suitedto our task and a discriminative tree-to tree transduction model that can naturallyaccount for structural and lexical mis matches.,{}
"The model incorporates a novelgrammar extraction method, uses a lan guage model for coherent output, and canbe easily tuned to a wide range of compres sion specific loss functions.",{}
Automatic sentence compression can be broadly described as the task of creating a grammaticalsummary of a single sentence with minimal information loss.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"They were asked to paraphrase while preserv ing the most important information and ensuring the compressed sentences remained grammatical.They were encouraged to use any rewriting opera tions that seemed appropriate, e.g., to delete words, add new words, substitute them or reorder them.Assessing inter-annotator agreement is notori ously difficult for paraphrasing tasks (Barzilay, 2003) since there can be many valid outputs for a given input.","{'title': 'Abstractive Compression Corpus.

From this we extracted grammar rules following the technique described in Cohn and Lapata (2007).,"{'title': 'Experimental Design. ', 'number': '5'}"
For the pivot grammarwe use the French-English Europarl v2 which con tains approximately 688K sentences.,"{'title': 'Experimental Design. ', 'number': '5'}"

"Note that our model has to work a lotharder than the baseline to preserve grammatical ity since we allow arbitrary rewrites which maylead to agreement or tense mismatches, and selec tional preference violations.","{'title': 'Results. ', 'number': '6'}"
"The scope for errors is greatly reduced when performing solely deletions.Finally, both the abstractive and extractive out puts are perceived as significantly worse than the gold standard both in terms of grammaticalityand importance (?","{'title': 'Results. ', 'number': '6'}"
