"Tree-adjoining rammars (TAG) constitute a grammat- ical formalism with attractive properties for the strong characterization f the syntax of natural angtmges, that is, characterization of the analysis trees of the expres- sions in the language (Kroch and Joshi, 1985; Kroch, 1989)) Among these properties are that o The domain of locality in TAGs is larger than lot formalisms lhat augment context-free grammars (such as lexical-functkmal, or generalized or head- driven phrase-structure grammar), and ? The statements of dependencies and recursion pos- sibilities in a tree are factored, the former following from primitive dependencies in elementary trees, the latter a consequence of an operatkm of adjunc- tion of trees.",Experiment/Discussion
"These unique properties of TAGs present a challenge tot the application of TAGs beyond the limited confines of syntax, for instance, to the task of semantic interpre- tation or automatic tr~mslation of natural anguage.",Experiment/Discussion
The slandm'd methods of moving beyond syntax to interpre- tation make use in one way or another of the compo- sitional structure of the analysis tree that is manifested in the tree's derivation.,Experiment/Discussion
Any version of compositional 1We assume familiarity throughout the paper with previous work on TAGs.,Experiment/Discussion
"See, for instance, the introduction by Joshi (1987).",Experiment/Discussion
"semantics, or syntax.directed translation relies on such a methodology to some extent.",Experiment/Discussion
"However, in the case of TAGs, the compositional structure of the tree is not miro rored by its derivational structure, so that a method for constructing semantics based on the compositional syn- tactic structure will be inherently nonderivational, that is, construction of the semantics will be independent of the derivation of the tree, and therefore subsequent.",Experiment/Discussion
"On the other hand, a method mirroring the deriva- tional structure will not necessarily be compositional with respect to tile derived structures of expressions.",Experiment/Discussion
"AI+ tl~ough such a method would be quite different from ttle primarily compositional methods previously postulated, it may have advantages, given that certain aspects of language seem to be noncompositional.",Experiment/Discussion
(See Section 4.),Experiment/Discussion
"In this paper, we present a varim~t of TAGs, called synchronous TAGs, which characterize correstxmdences between languages.",Experiment/Discussion
"The formalism's intended usage is to relate expressions of natural anguages to their asso- ciated semantics represented in a logical form language, or to their translations in another natural language; in summary, we intend the formalism to allow TAGs to be used beyond their role in syntax proper.",Experiment/Discussion
"We also discuss its application to concrete xamples, and mention some computational issues that arise in its interpretation.",Experiment/Discussion
"mal Description Language interpretation tasks can be thought of as asso- ciating a syntactic analysis of a sentence with some other stmcture,---a logical form representation r an analysis of a target language sentence, perhaps.",Experiment/Discussion
Synchronous TAGs are defined so as to make such associations explicit.,Experiment/Discussion
"The original language and its associated structures are both defined by grammars tated in a TAG formalism; the two TAGs are synchronous in the sense that adjunction and substitution operations are applied simultaneously to related nodes in pairs of trees, one for each language.",Experiment/Discussion
"For convenience, we will call the two languages ource and target languages, although the formalism is not in- herently directional.",Experiment/Discussion
"As an example, consider the task of relating a frag- ment of English with a simple representation of its predicate-argument structure.",Experiment/Discussion
A synchronous TAG for this purpose is given in Figure 1.,Experiment/Discussion
"Each element of the 1 253 NP V ~ R ~ T T \ V NP$ hates' / / I I George george' N Jb rocco l i ) \ br~coli \[ vP F \ p, A vp F,\] violently violently' I cooked cooked' I Figure 1: A sample synchronous TAG.",Experiment/Discussion
"synchronous TAG is a pair consisting of two elemen- tar2,' trees, one from tlie source language (English) and one from the target (logical form \[LF\]).",Experiment/Discussion
"Nodes, one from each tree, may be linked; ~ such links are depicted graph- ically as thick lines.",Experiment/Discussion
"If we project the pairs onto their first or second components (ignoring the cross links), the projections are TAGs for an English fragment and an LF fragment, respectively, qhese grammars are themselves written in a particular variant of TAGs; the choice of this base formalism, as we will call it, is free.",Experiment/Discussion
"In the case at hand, we have chosen single-component lexicalized TAGs with adjunction and substitution (Schabes et el., 1988).",Experiment/Discussion
Later examples are built on other bases.,Experiment/Discussion
The elementary operation in a synchronous TAG is su- pervenient on the elementary operations in the base for- malism.,Experiment/Discussion
"A derivation step from a pair of trees (cq, a2) proceeds as follows: 1.",Experiment/Discussion
". Nondeterministically choose a link in the pair con- necting two nodes (say, nl in cq and no in c~2).",Experiment/Discussion
"Nondeterministically choose a pair of trees (3~, 32) in the grammar.",Experiment/Discussion
"Form the resultant pair </3t(oq, nl), ;32(~2, n2)).",Experiment/Discussion
"where 3(c~, n) is the result of performing a primi- tive operation in the base formalism on a at node n using 3 (e.g., adjoining or substituting 3 into at n).",Experiment/Discussion
3 2We will generalize the links later to allow sets of nodes from one tree to be linked to sets from the other.,Experiment/Discussion
"3The definition allows for the operations performed on the first Synchronous TAG derivation then proceods by choos~ ing a pair of initial trees (cq, o~2) that is an element of the grammar, and repeatedly applying derivation steps as above.",Experiment/Discussion
"As an example, suppose we start with the tree pair c~ in Figure 1.",Experiment/Discussion
4 We choose the link from the subject NP to T and the tree pair fl to apply to its nodes.,Experiment/Discussion
"The resultant, by synchronous substitution, is the tree pair: i Ny T T,\ I I I \George V "" / ~P, hates' georgeJ / Note that the links from a are preserved in the resul- tant pair cq except for the chosen link, which has no counterpart in the result.",Experiment/Discussion
Using tree pair 7 on the remaining link from NP to T in oq yields o~ 2 \] NP VP~.,Experiment/Discussion
.~ ~ R T .~.,Experiment/Discussion
"T \ George y ~P hare'george')broccoli' \ hates broccoli This pairing manifests the correspondence b tween the sentence ""George hates broccoli"" and its logical form hates' (george' , broccoli') (as written in a more tradi- tional notation).",Experiment/Discussion
Here we see that the links in the opera?,Experiment/Discussion
"tor trees (those in 7) are preserved in the resultant pair, accounting for the sole remaining link.",Experiment/Discussion
"Tile trees in 7 are linked in this way so that other tree pairs can modify the N. We can continue the derivation, using 5 and ~ to gen- erate the pair given in Figure 2 thereby associating the meaning violently' ( hates' (george', cooked'( broccol i') ) ) ) with the sentence ""George hates cooked broccoli vio- lently.""",Experiment/Discussion
A subtle issue mises with respect o link updating in the resultant pair if two links impinge on the same node.,Experiment/Discussion
"When one of the links is chosen and an adjunction per- formed at the node, the other link must appear in the resultant.",Experiment/Discussion
The question as to whether that link should now end at the root or foot of the adjoined tree can be re- solved in several ways.,Experiment/Discussion
"Although the choice of method does not affect any of the examples in this paper, we mention our current resolution of this problem here.",Experiment/Discussion
"If the remaining link is connected initially to the top of and second trees to differ, one being a substitution and the other an adjunetion, for example.",Experiment/Discussion
"aWe uge standard TAG notation, marking foot nodes in auxiliary trees with '*' and nodes where substitution is m occur with '1/.",Experiment/Discussion
"The nonterminal names in the logical form grammar e mnemonic for Formula, Relation (or function) symbol, Term, and Quantifier.",Experiment/Discussion

"In all of the examples in this paper, the links may be thought of as connecting to the tops of nodes.",Experiment/Discussion
The issue has important ramifications.,Experiment/Discussion
"For instance, the link updating process allows for different derivations of a single derivation in the source language to correspond to derivations of different derivations in the ""target lan~ guage; that is, derivation order in synchronous TAGs is in this respect crucial, unlike in the base TAG for- malisms.",Experiment/Discussion
We rely on this property in the analysis of quantifier scope in Section 4.2.,Experiment/Discussion
"We turn to the question of why, in augmenting TAGs for the purposes of encoding semantic information, it is preferable to use the synchronous TAG method over more conventional methods, such as semantic rules in- volving logical operations (as in Montague grammar or generalized phrase-structure grammar) or complex- feature-structure encodings (as in unification-based or logic grammar formalisms), First, the arguments for factoring recursion and depen- dencies as TAGs do for the syntax of natural anguage have their counterparts in the semantics.",Experiment/Discussion
"The structure of TAGs allows syntactic dependencies--agreement, sub- categorization, and so forth--to be localized in the prim- itives of a grammar, the elementary trees.",Experiment/Discussion
"This is most dramatically evident in the case of long-distance depen- dencies, such as that between a wh-phrase and its as- sociated gap.",Experiment/Discussion
"Similarly, using TAGs to construct logi- cal forms allows the localization of semantic dependen- cies in the logical forms of natural language xpressions, dependencies such as the signature requirements (argu- ment type and arity) of function and relation symbols, and even the long-distance dependencies between a wh- quantifier and its associated bound variable.",Experiment/Discussion
"With other methods of semantics, these dependencies cannot be lo- calized; the semantic aspects of filler-gap dependencies must be passed among the features of various nodes in a parse tree or otherwise distributed over the entire deriva- tion.",Experiment/Discussion
"Second, the use of the synchronous TAG augmenta- tion allows ,an even more radical reduction in the role of features in a TAG grammar.",Experiment/Discussion
"Because of the extended domain of locality that TAGs possess, the role of features and unification is reduced from its role in context-free based systems.",Experiment/Discussion
"Only finite-valued features are needed, with the possible exception of a feature whose value encodes an expression's logical form.",Experiment/Discussion
"In removing the conslz'uction of logical forms from the duties delegateA to features, we can maintain a strictly finiteovalued-- and therefore formally dispensable---feature system Ibr TAGs.",Experiment/Discussion
"As a side note, we mention a ramification of the syn- chronous TAG analysis concerning the claim of Ka- plan and Zaenen (1989) that the paths over which long-distance dependencies operate (in the f-structure of lexieal-functional grammatical theory) form a regu- lar language.",Experiment/Discussion
Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1989) provide an argument that this claim follows from several as- sumptions concerning how a feature system for TAGs might be constrained.,Experiment/Discussion
"Vijay-Shanker (personal commu- nication) has noted that by placing a simple assumption on the elementary trees in the logical form component of a synchronous TAG, the proof of this claim becomes immediate.",Experiment/Discussion
Any TAG in which all foot nodes are im- mediate children of their associated root generates a tree path language that is regular.,Experiment/Discussion
"~Thus, a synchronous TAG (like the grammar presented in Figure 1) whose semantic component forms a TAG with this property necessarily obeys the regular language constraint on long-distance semantic dependencies.",Experiment/Discussion
"To exemplify the formalism's utility, we briefly and in- formally describe its application to the semantics of id- ioms and quantifiers.",Experiment/Discussion
"A companion paper (Abeill6 et al, 1990) uses a mapping between two TAGs for automatic translation between natural anguages, and constitutes a further application of the synchronous TAG concept.",Experiment/Discussion
"5This is a folk theorem whose straighlforward proof is left as an exercise for the reader, 3 255 More expansive descriptions of these analyses will be forthcoming in joint work with Anne Abeilld (idioms and translation) and Anthony Kroch (quantifiers).",Experiment/Discussion
"4,1 Id ioms Abeill6 and Schabes (1989) note that lexicalized TAGs are an appropriate r presentation language for idiomatic constructions, as their expanded omain of locality can account for many syntactic properties of idioms.",Experiment/Discussion
"It seems natural to generalize beyond syntax, as they do, to the claim that lexicalized 'FAGs allow one to deal with semantic noncompositionality.",Experiment/Discussion
"Their argument to this claim is based on an intuition that semantics de- pends on the TAG derivation structure, an intuition that synchronous TAGs makes precise.",Experiment/Discussion
"For example, the id- iomatic construction ""kick the bucket"" cashes out as the following tree pair, under its idiomatic interpretation: a3 d}e' $ whereas the literal usage of ""kick"" is associated with a tree pair similar to that of ""hates"" in Figure 1.",Experiment/Discussion
"Two derivations of the sentence ""George kicked the bucket"" are possible, each using a different one of these two elementary tree pairs, but both yielding identical de- rived constituency trees for the English.",Experiment/Discussion
"They will be associated, of course, with two different readings, cor- responding to the idiomatic (die'(yeorge')) and literal (kick'(george ~,bucket')) interpretations, respectively.",Experiment/Discussion
All of the arguments for the TAG analysis of idioms and light verb constructions can then be maintained in a formalism that allows for semantics for them as well.,Experiment/Discussion
"In particular, ? Discontinuous syntactic onstituents can be seman- tic'ally localized.",Experiment/Discussion
Nonstandard long-distance dependencies are stat- able without resort to reanalysis.,Experiment/Discussion
Both frozen and flexible idioms can be easily char- acterized.,Experiment/Discussion
4.2 Quant i f ie rs.,Experiment/Discussion
"In order to characterize quantifier scoping possibilities, we use a synchronous TAG whose base formalism is multi-component TAGs (Joshi, 1987), in which the prim- itive operation is incorporation (by multiple substitutions and adjunctions) of a set of elementary trees at once.",Experiment/Discussion
"In synchronous multi-component TAGs, the links between trees connect, in general, a set of nodes in one tree with a set in another.",Experiment/Discussion
"In particular, an NP will be linked both to a formula in the semantics (the quantifier's scope) and a term (the position bound by the quantifier).",Experiment/Discussion
"We will begin a derivation with just such a pair of elementat3, trees, depicted as at in Figure 3.",Experiment/Discussion
"To distinguish two separate links from a single link among several nodes, we use a coindexing--rather than graphical~-notation f r links.",Experiment/Discussion
"Thus, the subject NP node on the left is linked with both the F and first T node on the right, as indicated by the boxed index 1.",Experiment/Discussion
"The inteqgretation f such ""hyper-links"" is that when a pair is chosen to operate at the link, it must have sets of the correct sizes as its left and right component (1 and 2 in the case at hmad) and the sets are simultaneously used at the various nodes as in a multi-component ""lAG.",Experiment/Discussion
"For instance, a quantifiable noun will be paired with a set of two trees: 6 politician R T x politician Applying the latter multi-component tree pair fll to the initial tree pair a l , we derive the next stage in the deriva- tion o~2.",Experiment/Discussion
We have highlighted the link being operated on at this and later steps by using thick lines for the index boxes of the selected link.,Experiment/Discussion
The determiner can be introduced with the simple pair leading to the derivation step a3.,Experiment/Discussion
"Completing the deriva- tion using analogous elementary tree pairs, we might generate the final tree pair a4 of Figure 3.",Experiment/Discussion
"This final pairing associates the meaning By : vegetablc' (y).Vx : politician' (z).hates' ( z, y) with the sentence ""Every politician hates some veg- etable.""",Experiment/Discussion
"It should be clear that in a structure such as this with multiple NPs, the order of substitution of NPs de- termines the relative scope of the quantifiers, although it has no effect whatsoever on the syntactic structure.",Experiment/Discussion
"De- veloping this line of reasoning has led to several detailed predictions of this analysis of quantifier scope, which is beyond this paper's purview.",Experiment/Discussion
"In summary, however, the analysis is slightly more restrictive than that of Hobbs and Shieber (1987), making predictions regarding the scope of topicalized or wh-moved constituents, relative scope of embedded quantifiers, and possibly even syn- tactic structure of complex NPs.",Experiment/Discussion
The synchronous TAG formalism is inherently nondirec- tional.,Results/Conclusion
Derivation is not defined in terms of constructing 6The subscript x on certain nodes is the value of a feature on the nodes corresponding to the variable bound by the quantifier.,Results/Conclusion
"The technique of using metavariables to encode object variables is familiar from the logic and unification-based grammar literatures, Variable renaming with respect o these variables proceeds as usual.",Results/Conclusion

"Thus, it can be used to characterize both of these mappings.",Results/Conclusion
"Furthermore, the existence of a parsing algorithm for the base formalism of a synchronous TAG is a sufficient condition for interpreting a synchronous TAG grammar.",Results/Conclusion
Schabes and Joshi (1988) and Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985) provide parsing algorithms for TAGs that could serw:: to parse the base formalism of a synchronous TAG.,Results/Conclusion
"Given such an algorithm, semantic interpretation can be performed by parsing the sentence according to the source grammar; the pairings then determine a deriva- tion in the target language for tile logical form.",Results/Conclusion
Gen- eration from a logical form proceeds by the converse process of parsing the logical form expression thereby determining the derivation for the natural anguage sen- fence.,Results/Conclusion
"Machine translation proceeds akmg similar lines by mapping two 'FAGs directly (Abeill6 et al, 1990), In previous work, one of us noted that generation ac- cording to an augmented context-free grammar can be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to be se- mantically monotonic (Shieber, 1988); the derived se- mantics for an expression must include, in an appropri- ate sense, the semantic material of all its subconstituents.",Results/Conclusion
"It is interesting to note that synchronous ""FAGs are in- herently semantically monotonic.",Results/Conclusion
"Furthermore, it is rea- sonable to require that the semantic omponent of a syn- chronous TAG t~ lexicalized (in the sense of Schabes et al.",Results/Conclusion
"(1988)), allowing for more efficient parsing accord- ing to the semantic grammar and, consequenlly, more efficient generation.",Results/Conclusion
"In the case of augmented context- free grammars, the semantic monotonicity requirement precludes ""lexicalization"" of the semantics.",Results/Conclusion
It is not possible to require nontrivial semantics to be associated with each lexical item.,Results/Conclusion
"In summary, just as lexicaliza- lion of the syntactic grammar aids parsing (Schabes and Joshi, 1990), so lexicalization of the semantic gra.,nmz:r aids generation.",Results/Conclusion
"Tile description of parsing and germration above rnay seem to imply that these processes cannot be pcrlormcd incrementally, that is, an entire source derivation must be recovered before the corresponding target derivation can be computed.",Results/Conclusion
The issue deserves clarification.,Results/Conclusion
"In the case wltere the synchronous TAG is order- independent ( hat is, the order of derivation in one TAG does not effect the result in the other, as when no two links share an endpoint) there is a one-to-one mapping between the source and target derivation.",Results/Conclusion
"When par- tial source derivations are recognized by the parser, the corresponding partial target derivation (for example se- mantic inteq)retation) can be incrementally compuled: as the input is read from left to right, interpretations of the partial target derivations corresponding to partial source derivations can be combined in one step to buikl a larger partial target derivation.",Results/Conclusion
"5 257 When the synchronous TAG is order-sensitive, how- ever, there may be a many-to-many correspondence b - tween source derivations and target derivations.",Results/Conclusion
"This is the case, for instance, in a grammar in which alterna- tive quantifier scopings may be generated for a single sentence.",Results/Conclusion
"In this case, it is unclear what should even be meant by incremental computation.",Results/Conclusion
"For instance, mid- way in parsing a sentence, at a point at which a single quantified NP has been analyzed, the incremental inter- pretation could not possibly represent all possible scop- ings that that quantifier might end up taking, as it is not known what the quantifier might be required to scope with respect o. At the point in the parse where the scoping decision can be made, it is not clear whether an inerementality requirement would mean that the variant scopings must all be explicitly generated at that point, or only implicitly generable.",Results/Conclusion
"With respect o synchronous TAGs, these considera- tions are reflected in choice of parsing algorithm.",Results/Conclusion
Ef- ficiency of parsing necessitates that only one canonical derivation (say leftmost or rightmost) need to be com- puted; all other derivations yield the same object.,Results/Conclusion
Stan- dard parsing algorithms for both TAGs and CFGs rely on this optimization.,Results/Conclusion
"If incrementality requires that we generate xplicit representations of all possible interpre- tations (i.e., target derivations) of the string seen so far, then this optimization cannot be used, and parsing will be highly inefficient.",Results/Conclusion
"If the representation can be left im- plicit, the optimization can be maintained, but retrieval of explicit representations will be combinatorially more complex.",Results/Conclusion
