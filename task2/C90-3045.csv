"For instance, the link updating process allows for different derivations of a single derivation in the source language to correspond to derivations of different derivations in the ""target lan~ guage; that is, derivation order in synchronous TAGs is in this respect crucial, unlike in the base TAG for- malisms.","{'title': 'Synchronous TAGs--An Infor-.

We rely on this property in the analysis of quantifier scope in Section 4.2.,"{'title': 'Synchronous TAGs--An Infor-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"We turn to the question of why, in augmenting TAGs for the purposes of encoding semantic information, it is preferable to use the synchronous TAG method over more conventional methods, such as semantic rules in- volving logical operations (as in Montague grammar or generalized phrase-structure grammar) or complex- feature-structure encodings (as in unification-based or logic grammar formalisms), First, the arguments for factoring recursion and depen- dencies as TAGs do for the syntax of natural anguage have their counterparts in the semantics.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?.

"The structure of TAGs allows syntactic dependencies--agreement, sub- categorization, and so forth--to be localized in the prim- itives of a grammar, the elementary trees.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"This is most dramatically evident in the case of long-distance depen- dencies, such as that between a wh-phrase and its as- sociated gap.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Similarly, using TAGs to construct logi- cal forms allows the localization of semantic dependen- cies in the logical forms of natural language xpressions, dependencies such as the signature requirements (argu- ment type and arity) of function and relation symbols, and even the long-distance dependencies between a wh- quantifier and its associated bound variable.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"With other methods of semantics, these dependencies cannot be lo- calized; the semantic aspects of filler-gap dependencies must be passed among the features of various nodes in a parse tree or otherwise distributed over the entire deriva- tion.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, the use of the synchronous TAG augmenta- tion allows ,an even more radical reduction in the role of features in a TAG grammar.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Because of the extended domain of locality that TAGs possess, the role of features and unification is reduced from its role in context-free based systems.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Only finite-valued features are needed, with the possible exception of a feature whose value encodes an expression's logical form.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In removing the conslz'uction of logical forms from the duties delegateA to features, we can maintain a strictly finiteovalued-- and therefore formally dispensable---feature system Ibr TAGs.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?. ', 'number': '3'}"
"As a side note, we mention a ramification of the syn- chronous TAG analysis concerning the claim of Ka- plan and Zaenen (1989) that the paths over which long-distance dependencies operate (in the f-structure of lexieal-functional grammatical theory) form a regu- lar language.","{'title': 'Why Synchronous TAGs?.
