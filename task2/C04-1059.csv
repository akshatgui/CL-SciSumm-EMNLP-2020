We explore unsupervised language model adaptation techniques for Statistical Machine Translation.,{}
The hypotheses from the machine translation output are converted into queries at different levels of representation power and used to extract similar sentences from very large monolingual text collection.,{}
Specific language models are then build from the retrieved data and interpolated with a general background model.,{}
Experiments show significant improvements when translating with these adapted language models.,{}

The quality of the query models is crucial to the adapted language model?s performance.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
Three bag-of-words query models are proposed and explained in the following sections.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
2.1 Sentence Retrieval Process.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In our sentence retrieval process, the standard tf/idf (term frequency and inverse document frequency) term weighting scheme is used.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
The queries are built from the translation hypotheses.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"We follow (Eck, et al, 2004) in considering each sentence in the monolingual corpus as a document, as they have shown that this gives better results compared to retrieving entire news stories.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
Both the query and the sentences in the text corpus are converted into vectors by assigning a term weight to each word.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
Then the cosine similarity is calculated proportional to the inner product of the two vectors.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"All sentences are ranked according to their similarity with the query, and the most similar sentences are used as the data for building the specific language model.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In our experiments we use different numbers of similar sentences, ranting from one to several thousand.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
2.2 Bag-of-words Query Models.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
Different query models are designed to guide the data augmentation efficiently.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
We first define ?bag-of-words?,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"models, based on different levels of knowledge collected from the hypotheses of the statistical machine translation engine.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
2.2.1 First-best Hypothesis as a Query Model The first-best hypothesis is the Viterbi path in the search space returned from the statistical machine translation decoder.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"It is the optimal hypothesis the statistical machine translation system can generate using the given translation and language model, and restricted by the applied pruning strategy.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Ignoring word order, the hypothesis is converted into a bag-of-words representation, which is then used as a query: }|),{(),,( 1211 TiiilT VwfwwwwQ ?== L where iw is a word in the vocabulary 1TV of the Top 1 hypothesis.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
if is the frequency of iw ?s occurrence in the hypothesis.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The first-best hypothesis is the actual translation we want to improve, and usually it captures enough correct word translations to secure a sound adaptation process.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"But it can miss some informative translation words, which could lead to better-adapted language models.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"2.2.2 N-Best Hypothesis List as a Query Model Similar to the first-best hypothesis, the n-best hypothesis list is converted into a bag-of-words representation.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
Words which occurred in several translation hypotheses are simply repeated in the bag-of-words representations.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"

"TNQ has several good characteristics: First it contains translation candidates, and thus is more informative than 1TQ . In addition, the confidently translated words usually occur in every hypothesis in the n-best list, therefore have a stronger impact on the retrieval result due to the higher term frequency (tf) in the query.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Thirdly, most of the hypotheses are only different from each other in one word or two.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This means, there is not so much noise and variance introduced in this query model.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"2.2.3 Translation Model as a Query Model To fully leverage the available knowledge from the translation system, the translation model can be used to guide the language model adaptation process.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"

"Thus the query model based on the translation model, has potential advantages over both 1TQ and TNQ . To utilize the translation model, all the n-grams from the source sentence are extracted, and the corresponding candidate translations are collected from the translation model.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval.

"jsiw , is a candidate target word as translation of is . Thus the translation model is converted into a collection of target words as a bag-of-word query model.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"There is no decoding process involved to build TMQ . This means TMQ does not incorporate any background language model information at all, while both 1TQ and TNQ implicitly use the background language model to prune the words in the query.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus TMQ is a generalization, and 1TQ and TNQ are pruned versions.","{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
This also means TMQ is subject to more noise.,"{'title': 'LM Adaptation via Sentence Retrieval. ', 'number': '2'}"
Word proximity and word order is closely related to syntactic and semantic characteristics.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"However, it is not modeled in the query models presented so far, which are simple bag-of-words representations.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"

3.1 Structured Query Language.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"This query language essentially enables the use of proximity operators (ordered and unordered windows) in queries, so that it is possible to model the syntactic and semantic information encoded in phrases, n-grams, and co-occurred word pairs.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models.

The InQuery implementation (Lemur 2003) is applied.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"So far 16 operators are defined in InQuery to model word proximity (ordered, unordered, phrase level, and passage level).","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
Four of these operators are used specially for our language model adaptation: Sum Operator: #sum( 1t ? nt ) The terms or nodes ( 1t ? nt ) are treated as having equal influence on the final retrieval result.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
The belief values provided by the arguments of the sum are averaged to produce the belief value of the #sum node.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Weighted Sum Operator: #wsum( 11 : tw , ?) The terms or nodes ( 1t ? nt ) contribute unequally to the final result according to the weight ( iw ) associated with each it . Ordered Distance Operator: #N( 1t ? nt ) The terms must be found within N words of each other in the text in order to contribute to the document's belief value.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
An n-gram phrase can be modeled as an ordered distance operator with N=n. Unordered Distance Operator: #uwN( 1t ? nt ) The terms contained must be found in any order within a window of N words in order for this operator to contribute to the belief value of the document.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models.

3.2 Structured Query Models.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Given the representation power of the structured query language, the Top-1 hypothesis, Top-N Best hypothesis list, and the translation lattice can be converted into three Structured Query Models respectively.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For first-best and n-best hypotheses, we collect related target n-grams of a given source word according to the alignments generated in the Viterbi decoding process.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"While for the translation lattice, similar to the construction of TMQ , we collect all the source n-grams, and translate them into target n-grams.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In either case, we get a set of target n-grams for each source word.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"

"The second simplification is that every source word is equally important, thus each n-gram subset is t v will have an equal contribution to the final retrieval results.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The last simplification is each n-gram within the set of is t v has an equal weight, i.e. we do not use the translation probabilities of the translation model.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
"If the system is a phrase-based translation system, we can encode the phrases using the ordered distance operator (#N) with N equals to the number of the words of that phrase, which is denoted as the #phrase operator in InQuery implementation.","{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
The 2-grams and 3-grams can be encoded using this operator too.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
Thus our final structured query model is a sum operator over a set of nodes.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"
Each node corresponds to a source word.,"{'title': 'Structured Query Models. ', 'number': '3'}"

"Adding word order information to the queries obviously helps to reduce the noise in the retrieved data by selecting sentences, which are closer to the good translations, The best results using the adapted language models are NIST score 8.12 for using the 2000 most similar sentences, whereas Bleu score goes up to 0.2068 when using 4000 sentences for language model adaptation.","{'title': 'Experiments.

"Table-3 Translation examples 4.6 Oracle Experiment Finally, we run an oracle experiments to see how much improvement could be achieved if we only selected better data for the specific language models.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
We converted the four available reference translations into structured query models and retrieved the top 4000 relevant sentences from AFE corpus for each source sentence.,"{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
"Using these language models, interpolated with the background language model gave a NIST score of 8.67, and a Bleu score of 0.2228.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
This result indicates that there is room for further improvements using this language model adaptation technique.,"{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
The oracle experiment suggests that better initial translations lead to better language models and thereby better 2nd iteration translations.,"{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
"This lead to the question if we can iterate the retrieval process several times to get further improvement, or if the observed improvement results form using for (good) translations, which have more diversity than the translations in an n-best list.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
On the other side the oracle experiment also shows that the optimally expected improvement is limited by the translation model and decoding algorithm used in the current SMT system.,"{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
"In this paper, we studied language model adaptation for statistical machine translation.","{'title': 'Summary. ', 'number': '5'}"
"Extracting sentences most similar to the initial translations, building specific language models for each sentence to be translated, and interpolating those with the background language models gives significant improvement in translation quality.","{'title': 'Summary. ', 'number': '5'}"
"Using structured query models, which capture word order information, leads to better results that plain bag of words models.","{'title': 'Summary. ', 'number': '5'}"
The results obtained suggest a number of extensions of this work: The first question is if more data to retrieve similar sentences from will result in even better translation quality.,"{'title': 'Summary. ', 'number': '5'}"
A second interesting question is if the translation probabilities can be incorporated into the queries.,"{'title': 'Summary. ', 'number': '5'}"
This might be especially useful for structured query models generated from the translation lattices.,"{'title': 'Summary. ', 'number': '5'}"
