"We present a framework for statistical machine translation of natural languages based on direct maximum entropy models, which contains the widely used source-channel approach as a special case.",{}
"All knowledge sources are treated as feature functions, which depend on the source language sentence, the target language sentence and possible hidden variables.",{}
This approach allows a baseline machine translation system to be extended easily by adding new feature functions.,{}
We show that a baseline statistical machine translation system is significantly improved using this approach.,{}
"We are given a source (‘French’) sentence fJ1 = f1, ... , fj, ... , fJ, which is to be translated into a target (‘English’) sentence eI1 = e1, ... , ei, ... , eI.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Among all possible target sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability:1 The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The overall architecture of the source-channel approach is summarized in Figure 1.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In general, as shown in this figure, there may be additional transformations to make the translation task simpler for the algorithm.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Typically, training is performed by applying a maximum likelihood approach.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"If the language model Pr(eI1) = pγ(eI1) depends on parameters γ and the translation model Pr(fJ1 |eI1) = pθ(fJ1 |eI1) depends on parameters θ, then the optimal parameter values are obtained by maximizing the likelihood on a parallel training corpus fS1 , eS1 (Brown et al., 1993): We obtain the following decision rule: instead of Eq.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"5 (Och et al., 1999): State-of-the-art statistical MT systems are based on this approach.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Yet, the use of this decision rule has various problems: Here, we replaced pˆ�(fJ1 |ei) by pˆ�(ei|fJ1 ).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"From a theoretical framework of the sourcechannel approach, this approach is hard to justify.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Yet, if both decision rules yield the same translation quality, we can use that decision rule which is better suited for efficient search.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As alternative to the source-channel approach, we directly model the posterior probability Pr(ei|fJ1 ).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"An especially well-founded framework for doing this is maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this framework, we have a set of M feature functions hm(ei, fJ1 ), m = 1, ... , M. For each feature function, there exists a model parameter am, m = 1, ... , M. The direct translation probability is given the following two feature functions: This approach has been suggested by (Papineni et al., 1997; Papineni et al., 1998) for a natural language understanding task.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"In this framework, this feature can be as good as log Pr(fJ1 |eI1).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It has to be empirically verified, which of the two features yields better results.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We even can use both features log Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) and log Pr(fJ1 |eI1), obtaining a more symmetric translation model.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As training criterion, we use the maximum class posterior probability criterion: This corresponds to maximizing the equivocation or maximizing the likelihood of the direct translation model.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This direct optimization of the posterior probability in Bayes decision rule is referred to as discriminative training (Ney, 1995) because we directly take into account the overlap in the probability distributions.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The optimization problem has one global optimum and the optimization criterion is convex.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Typically, the probability Pr(fJ1 |eI1) is decomposed via additional hidden variables.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In statistical alignment models Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1), the alignment aJ1 is introduced as a hidden variable:","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As specific MT method, we use the alignment template approach (Och et al., 1999).","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"The key elements of this approach are the alignment templates, which are pairs of source and target language phrases together with an alignment between the words within the phrases.","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
The advantage of the alignment template approach compared to single word-based statistical translation models is that word context and local changes in word order are explicitly considered.,"{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
The alignment template model refines the translation probability Pr(fJ1 |eI1) by introducing two hidden variables zK1 and aK1 for the K alignment templates and the alignment of the alignment templates: The alignment mapping is j → i = aj from source position j to target position i = aj.,"{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"Search is performed using the so-called maximum approximation: Hence, the search space consists of the set of all possible target language sentences eI1 and all possible alignments aJ1 .","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"Generalizing this approach to direct translation models, we extend the feature functions to include the dependence on the additional hidden variable.","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"Using M feature functions of the form hm(eI1, fJ1 , aJ1), m = 1, ... , M, we obtain the following model: Obviously, we can perform the same step for translation models with an even richer structure of hidden variables than only the alignment aJ1 .","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"To simplify the notation, we shall omit in the following the dependence on the hidden variables of the model.","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"Hence, we obtain three different probability distributions: Pr(aK1 |eI1), Pr(zK1 |aK1 , eI1) and Pr(fJ1 |zK1 ,aK1 ,eI1).","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"Here, we omit a detailed description of modeling, training and search, as this is not relevant for the subsequent exposition.","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"For further details, see (Och et al., 1999).","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"To use these three component models in a direct maximum entropy approach, we define three different feature functions for each component of the translation model instead of one feature function for the whole translation model p(fJ1 |eI1).","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"The feature functions have then not only a dependence on fJ1 and eI1 but also on zK1 , aK1 .","{'title': '2 Alignment Templates', 'number': '2'}"
"So far, we use the logarithm of the components of a translation model as feature functions.","{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
This is a very convenient approach to improve the quality of a baseline system.,"{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
"Yet, we are not limited to train only model scaling factors, but we have many possibilities: This corresponds to a word penalty for each produced target word.","{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
• We could use grammatical features that relate certain grammatical dependencies of source and target language.,"{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, using a function k(·) that counts how many verb groups exist in the source or the target sentence, we can define the following feature, which is 1 if each of the two sentences contains the same number of verb groups: In the same way, we can introduce semantic features or pragmatic features such as the dialogue act classification.","{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
We can use numerous additional features that deal with specific problems of the baseline statistical MT system.,"{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, we shall use the first three of these features.","{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
"As additional language model, we use a class-based five-gram language model.","{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
"This feature and the word penalty feature allow a straightforward integration into the used dynamic programming search algorithm (Och et al., 1999).","{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"
"As this is not possible for the conventional dictionary feature, we use n-best rescoring for this feature.","{'title': '3 Feature functions', 'number': '3'}"

"8 requires a sum over a large number of possible sentences, for which we do not know an efficient algorithm.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"Hence, we approximate this sum by sampling the space of all possible sentences by a large set of highly probable sentences.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"The set of considered sentences is computed by an appropriately extended version of the used search algorithm (Och et al., 1999) computing an approximate n-best list of translations.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"Unlike automatic speech recognition, we do not have one reference sentence, but there exists a number of reference sentences.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"Yet, the criterion as it is described in Eq.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
11 allows for only one reference translation.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"

11.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"In addition, we might have the problem that no single of the reference translations is part of the nbest list because the search algorithm performs pruning, which in principle limits the possible translations that can be produced given a certain input sentence.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"To solve this problem, we define for maximum entropy training each sentence as reference translation that has the minimal number of word errors with respect to any of the reference translations.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"

Table 1 shows the corpus statistics of this task.,"{'title': '5 Results', 'number': '5'}"
"We use a training corpus, which is used to train the alignment template model and the language models, a development corpus, which is used to estimate the model scaling factors, and a test corpus.","{'title': '5 Results', 'number': '5'}"
"So far, in machine translation research does not exist one generally accepted criterion for the evaluation of the experimental results.","{'title': '5 Results', 'number': '5'}"
"Therefore, we use a large variety of different criteria and show that the obtained results improve on most or all of these criteria.","{'title': '5 Results', 'number': '5'}"
"In all experiments, we use the following six error criteria: of the target sentence, so that the WER measure alone could be misleading.","{'title': '5 Results', 'number': '5'}"
