This paper proposes a tree kernel with contextsensitive structured parse tree information for re lation extraction.,{}
It resolves two critical problems in previous tree kernels for relation extraction in two ways.,{}
"First, it automatically determines a dynamic context-sensitive tree span for relation ex traction by extending the widely-used Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) to include necessary context information outside SPT.",{}
"Second, it pro poses a context-sensitive convolution tree kernel, which enumerates both context-free and context sensitive sub-trees by considering their ancestor node paths as their contexts.",{}
"Moreover, this paper evaluates the complementary nature between our tree kernel and a state-of-the-art linear kernel.",{}
Evaluation on the ACE RDC corpora shows that our dynamic context-sensitive tree span is much more suitable for relation extraction than SPT and our tree kernel outperforms the state-of-the-art Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel.,{}
"It also shows that our tree kernel achieves much bet ter performance than the state-of-the-art linear kernels . Finally, it shows that feature-based and tree kernel-based methods much complement each other and the composite kernel can well integrate both flat and structured features.",{}

Many researches have been done in relation extraction.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Among them, feature-based methods (Kamb hatla 2004; Zhou et al, 2005) achieve certain success by employing a large amount of diverse linguistic features, varying from lexical knowledge, entityrelated information to syntactic parse trees, depend ency trees and semantic information.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Although earlier researches (Zelenko et al2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004; Bunescu and Mooney 2005a) only achieve success on simple tasks and fail on complex tasks, such as the ACE RDC task, tree kernel-based methods achieve much progress recently.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As the state-of-the-art, Zhang et al(2006) applied the convo lution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy 2001) and achieved comparable performance with a state-of-the art linear kernel (Zhou et al2005) on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Zhang et al(2006) explored five tree spans in relation extraction and it was a bit sur prising to find that the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT, i.e. the sub-tree enclosed by the shortest path linking two involved entities in the parse tree) performed best.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

It is obvious that the information con tained in SPT (?John and Marry?),"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The relation extraction task was first introduced as part of the Template Element task in MUC6 and then formulated as the Template Relation task in MUC7.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Since then, many methods, such as feature-based (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al2005, 2006), tree ker nel-based (Zelenko et al2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004; Bunescu and Mooney 2005a; Zhang et al2006) and composite kernel-based (Zhao and Gris hman 2005; Zhang et al2006), have been proposed in lit erature.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For the feature-based methods, Kambhatla (2004) employed Maximum Entropy models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features in rela tion extraction, and achieved the F-measure of 52.8 on the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.","{'title': 'Related Work.

"Zhou et al(2005) further systematically ex plored diverse features through a linear kernel and Support Vector Machines, and achieved the F measures of 68.0 and 55.5 on the 5 relation types and the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 cor pus respectively.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
One problem with the feature-based methods is that they need extensive feature engineering.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Another problem is that, although they can ex plore some structured information in the parse tree (e.g. Kambhatla (2004) used the non-terminal path connecting the given two entities in a parse tree while Zhou et al (2005) introduced additional chunking features to enhance the performance), it is found dif ficult to well preserve structured information in the parse trees using the feature-based methods.","{'title': 'Related Work.

"In particular, the kernel-based methods could be very effective at reducing the burden of feature engineer ing for structured objects in NLP researches, e.g. the tree structure in relation extraction.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Zelenko et al (2003) proposed a kernel between two parse trees, which recursively matches nodes from roots to leaves in a top-down manner.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For each pair of matched nodes, a subsequence kernel on their child nodes is invoked.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
They achieved quite success on two simple relation extraction tasks.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
Culotta and Sorensen (2004) extended this work to estimate simi larity between augmented dependency trees and achieved the F-measure of 45.8 on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"

"Bunescu and Mooney (2005a) pro posed a shortest path dependency tree kernel, which just sums up the number of common word classes at each position in the two paths, and achieved the F-measure of 52.5 on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
They argued that the information to model a relationship between two entities can be typically captured by the shortest path between them in the dependency graph.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"While the shortest path may not be able to well preserve structured de pendency tree information, another problem with their kernel is that the two paths should have same length.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
This makes it suffer from the similar behavior with that of Culotta and Sorensen (2004): high preci sion but very low recall.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"As the state-of-the-art tree kernel-based method, Zhang et al(2006) explored various structured feature 729 spaces and used the convolution tree kernel over parse trees (Collins and Duffy 2001) to model syntac tic structured information for relation extraction.","{'title': 'Related Work.

They achieved the F-measures of 61.9 and 63.6 on the 5 relation types of the ACE RDC 2003 corpus and the 7 relation types of the ACE RDC 2004 corpus respectively without entity-related information while the F measure on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus reached 68.7 when entity-related infor mation was included in the parse tree.,"{'title': 'Related Work.

"One problem with Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel is that the sub-trees involved in the tree kernel computa tion are context-free, that is, they do not consider the information outside the sub-trees.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This is different from the tree kernel in Culota and Sorensen (2004), where the sub-trees involved in the tree kernel com putation are context-sensitive (that is, with the path from the tree root node to the sub-tree root node in consideration).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
