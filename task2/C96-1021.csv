"Once the representation f the text has been recast as a set of discourse referents (ordered by offset value), it is sent to the anaphora resolution algorithm proper.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"

The interpretation procedure in- volves moving through the text sentence by sentence and interpreting the discourse referents in each sen- tence from left to right.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"There are two possible in- terpretations of a discourse referent: either it is taken to introduce a new participant in the discourse, or it is taken to refer to a previously interpreted iscourse referent.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Coreference is determined by first eliminating from consideration those discourse referents to which an anaphoric expression cannot possibly refer, then se- lecting the optimal antecedent from the candidates that remain, where optimality is determined by a salience measure.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to present the details of anaphora resolution, we define below our notions--and implementations-- of coreference and salience.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"2.2.1 Coreference As in the Lappin and Leass algorithm, the anaphor- antecedent relation is established between two dis- course referents (cf.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"(Helm, 1982), (Kamp, 1981)), @hile the more general notion of coreference is represented in terms of equivalence classes of anaphorically re- lated discourse referents, which we will refer to as ""COREF classes"".","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, the problem of interpreting an anaphoric expression boils down to the problem of es- tablishing an anaphoric link between the anaphor and some previously interpreted iscourse referent (pos- sibly another anaphor); a consequence of establishing 114 this link is that the anaphor becomes a member of the COREF class already associated with its antecedent.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In our implementation, COREF classes are repre- sented as objects in the Common Lisp Object System which contain information about the COREF class as a whole, including canonical form (typically deter- mined by the discourse referent which introduces the class), membership, and, most importantly, salience (discussed below).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
1 The connection between a dis- course referent and its COREF class is mediated through the COREF object as follows: every discourse referent includes an information parameter which is a pointer to a COREF object; discourse referents which have been determined to be coreferential share the same COREF value (and so literally point to the same object).,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Imple- menting coreference in this way provides a means of getting from any discourse referent in a COREF class to information about the class as a whole.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"2.2.2 Salience The information parameter of a COREF object most cru- cial to anaphora resolution is its salience, which is de- termined by the status of the members of the COREF class it re.presents with respect to 10 contextual, gram- matical, and syntactic onstraints.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Following (Lappin and Leass, 1994), we will refer to these constraints as ""salience factors"".","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Individual salience factors are asso- ciated with numerical values; the overall salience, or ""salience weight"" of a COREF is the sum of the values of the salience factors that are satisfied by some member of the COREF class (note that values may be satisfied at most once by each member of the class).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
The salience factors used by our algorithm are defined below with their values.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Our salience factors mirror those used by (Lappin and Leass, 1994), with the exception of Poss-s, discussed below, and CNTX-S, which is sensitive to the context in which a discourse referent appears, where a context is a topically coherent segment of text, as deter- mined by a text-segmentation algorithm which follows (Hearst, 1994).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"SENT-S: 100 iff in the current sentence CNTX-S: 50 iff in the current context SUBJ-S: 80 iff GFUN = subject EXST-S: 70 iff in an existential construction POSS-S: 65 iff GFUN = possessive ACC-S: 50 iff GFUN = direct object DAT-S: 40 iff GFUN = indirect object OBLQ-S: 30 iff the complement of a preposition HEAD-S: 80 iff EMBED = NIL ARG-S: 50 iff ADJUNCT = NIL Note that the values of salience factors are arbitrary; what is crucial, as pointed out by (Lappin and Leass, 1994), is the relational structure imposed on the factors by these values.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The relative ranking of the factors is justified both linguistically, as a reflection of the role of the functional hierarchy in determining anaphoric relations (cf.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"(Keenan and Comrie, 1977)), as well as by experimental results--both Lappin and Leass' and our own.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For all factors except CNTX-S and POSS-S, we adopt the values derived from a series of experiments described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) which used dif- ferent settings to determine the relative importance of 1The implementation of aCOREF object needs to be aware of po- tenlial circularities, thus a COREF does not actually contain its member discourse r ferents, but rather alisting of their offsets, each factor as a function of the overall success of the algorithm.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Our values for CNTX-S and POSS-S were de- termined using similar tests.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"An important feature of our implementation of salience, following that of Lappin and Leass, is that it is variable: the salience of a COREF class decreases and increases according to the frequency of reference to the class.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"When an anaphoric link is established between a pronoun and a previously introduced iscourse refer- ent, the pronoun is added to the COREF class associated with the discourse referent, its COREF value is set to the COREF value of the antecedent (i.e., to the COREF ob- ject which represents he class), and the salience of the COREF object is recalculated according to how the new member satisfies the set of salience factors.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This final step raises the overall salience of the COREF, since the new member will minimally satisfy SENT-S and CNTX-S.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Salience is not stable, however: in order to realisti- cally represent the local prominence of discourse ref- erents in a text, a decay function is built into the algo- rithm, so that salience weight decreases over time.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"If new members are not added, the salience weight of a COREF eventually reduces to zero.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
The consequence of this variability in salience is that a very general heuris- tic for anaphora resolution is established: resolve a pronoun to the most salient candidate antecedent.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"2.2.3 Interpretation As noted above, in terms of overall strategy, the resolu- tion procedure follows that of Lappin and Leass.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
The first step in interpreting the discourse referents in a new sentence isto decrease the salience weights of the COREF classes that have already been established by a factor of two.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Next, the algorithm locates all non-anaphoric dis- course referents in the sentence under consideration, generates a new COREF class for each one, and calcu- lates its salience weight according to how the discourse referent satisfies the set of salience factors.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
The second step involves the interpretation f lexical anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals).,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"A list of candi- date antecedent-anaphor pairs is generated for every lexical anaphor, based on the hypothesis that a lexical anaphor must refer to a coargument.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In the absence of configurational information, coarguments are iden- tified using grammatical function information (as de- termined by LINGSOFT) and precedence relations.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"A reflexive can have one of three possible grammatical function values: direct object, indirect object, or oblique.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In the first case, the closest preceding discourse referent with grammatical function value subject is identified as a possible antecedent.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In the latter cases, both the clos- est preceding subject and the closest preceding direct object hat is not separated from the anaphor by a sub- ject are identified as possible antecedents.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"If more than one possible antecedent is located for a lexical anaphor, the one with the highest salience weight is determined to be the actual antecedent.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Once an antecedent has been located, the anaphor is added to the COREF class associated with the antecedent, and the salience of the COREF class is recalculatec~ accordingly.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
The final step is the interpretation f pronouns.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The basic resolution heuristic, as noted above, is quite sim- ple: generate a set of candidate antecedents, then es- tablish coreference with the candidate which has the greatest salience weight (in the event of a tie, the clos- est candidateis chosen).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to generate the candi- date set, however, those discourse referents with which 115 a pronoun cannot refer must be eliminated from consid- eration.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This is accomplished by running the overall candidate pool (the set of interpreted iscourse ref- erents whose salience values exceed an arbitrarily set threshold) through two sets of filters: a set of morpho- logical agreement filters, which eliminate from consid- eration any discourse referent which disagrees in per- son, numbeb or gender with the pronoun, and a set of disjoint reference filters.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The determination f disjoint reference represents a significant point of divergence between our algorithm and the Lappin/Leass algorithm, because, as is well known, configurational relations play a prominent role in determining which constituents in a sentence a pro- noun may refer to.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Three conditions are of particular relevance to the anaphora resolution algorithm: Condition \]: A pronoun cannot corefer with a coargument.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Condition 2: A pronoun cannot corefer with a nonpronominal constituent which it both commands and precedes.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Condition 3: A pronoun cannot corefer with a constituent which contains it.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In the absence of configurafional information, our al- gorithm relies on inferences from grammatical func- tion and precedence todetermine disjoint reference.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In practice, even without accurate information about con- stituent structure, the syntactic filters described below are extremely accurate (see the discussion of this point in section 4).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Condition i is implemented bylocating all discourse referents with GFUN value direct object, indirect object, or oblique which follow a pronoun with GFUN value subject or direct object, as long as no subject intervenes (the hypothesis being that a subject indicates the beginning of the next clause).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Discourse referents which satisfy these conditions are identified as disjoint.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Condition 2 is implemented by locating for ev- ery non-adjunct and non-embedded pronoun the set of non-pronominal discourse referents in its sentence which follow it, and eliminating these as potential an- tecedents.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In effect, the command relation is inferred from precedence and the information provided by the syntactic patterns: an argument which is neither con- tained in an adjunct nor embedded in another nominal commands those expressions which it precedes.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Condition 3 makes use of the observation that a dis- course referent contains every object o its right with a non-nil EMBED value.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The algorithm identifies as dis- joint a discourse referent and every pronoun which fol- lows it and has a non-nil EMBED value, until a discourse referent with EMBED value NIL is located (marking the end of the containment domain).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
Condiditon 3 also rules out coreference between a genitive pronoun and the NP it modifies.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"After the morphological nd syntactic filters have been applied, the set of discourse referents that remain constitute the set of candidate antecedents for the pro- noun.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The candidate set is subjected to a final evalu- ation procedure which performs two functions: it de- creases the salience of candidates which the pronoun precedes (cataphora is penalized), and it increases the sa li ence of candida tes which satisfy either a locality or a parallelism condition (described below), both of which apply to intrasentential c ndidates.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The h)cality heuristic isdesigned to negate the effects of subordinationwhen both candidate and anaphor ap- pear in the same subordinate context, the assumption being that the prominence of a candidate should be de- termined with respect o the position of the anaphor.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This is a point of difference between our algorithm and the one described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994).","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
The salience of a candidate which is determined tobe in the same subordinate context as a pronoun (determined as a function of precedence r lations and EMBED and ADJUNCT values) is temporarily increased to the level it would have were the candidate not in the subordi- nate context; the level is returned to normal after the anaphor is resolved.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm.

The parallelism heuristic rewards candidates which are such that the pair consisting of the GFUN values of candidate and anaphor are identical to GFUN values of a previously identified anaphor-antecedent pair.,"{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This parallelism heuristic differs from a similar one used by the Lappin/Leass algorithm, which rewards candi- dates whose grammatical function is identical to that of an anaphor.","{'title': 'General outline of the algorithm. ', 'number': '2'}"
