We use logical inference techniques for recognising textual entailment.,{}
"As the performance of theorem proving turnsout to be highly dependent on not read ily available background knowledge, we incorporate model building, a technique borrowed from automated reasoning, and show that it is a useful robust method to approximate entailment.",{}
"Finally, we use machine learning to combine these deep semantic analysis techniques with simpleshallow word overlap; the resulting hy brid model achieves high accuracy on the RTE testset, given the state of the art.",{}
"Ourresults also show that the different techniques that we employ perform very dif ferently on some of the subsets of the RTE corpus and as a result, it is useful to use the nature of the dataset as a feature.",{}
Recognising textual entailment (RTE) is the task to find out whether some text T entails a hypothesis H. This task has recently been the focus of a challenge organised by the PASCAL network in 2004/5.1 In Example 1550 H follows from T whereas this is not the case in Example 731.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
1All examples are from the corpus released as part of the RTE challenge.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
It is downloadable from http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The exam ple numbers have also been kept.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Each example is marked for entailment as TRUE if H follows from T and FALSE otherwise.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The dataset is described in Section 4.1.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Example: 1550 (TRUE) T: In 1998, the General Assembly of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai (Anglican Church in Japan) voted to accept female priests.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
H: The Anglican church in Japan approved the ordination of women.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Example: 731 (FALSE) T: The city Tenochtitlan grew rapidly and was the center of the Aztec?s great empire.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"H: Tenochtitlan quickly spread over the island, marshes, and swamps.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The recognition of textual entailment is without doubt one of the ultimate challenges for any NLPsystem: if it is able to do so with reasonable accuracy, it is clearly an indication that it has some thor ough understanding of how language works.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Indeed, recognising entailment bears similarities to Turing?s famous test to assess whether machines can think, as access to different sources of knowledge and theability to draw inferences seem to be among the primary ingredients for an intelligent system.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Moreover, many NLP tasks have strong links to entailment: in summarisation, a summary should be en tailed by the text; paraphrases can be seen as mutualentailment between T and H; in IE, the extracted in formation should also be entailed by the text.In this paper, we discuss two methods for recog nising textual entailment: a shallow method relyingmainly on word overlap (Section 2), and deep se mantic analysis, using state-of-the-art off-the-shelf inference tools, namely a theorem prover and amodel builder (Section 3).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
These tools rely on Dis course Representation Structures for T and H as well as lexical and world knowledge.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"To our knowledge, few approaches to entailment currently use theorem provers and none incorporate model building (see 628 Section 5 for a discussion of related work).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Both methods are domain-independent to increasetransferrability and have not been tailored to any par ticular test suite.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
In Section 4 we test their accuracy and robustness on the RTE datasets as one of the few currently available datasets for textual inference.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We also combine the two methods in a hybrid approach using machine learning.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We discuss particularly the following questions:?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Can the methods presented improve significantly over the baseline and what are the per formance differences between them?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Does thehybrid system using both shallow and deep se mantic analysis improve over the individual use of these methods?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
How far does deep semantic analysis suffer from a lack of lexical and world knowledge and how can we perform logical inference in the face of potentially large knowledge gaps??,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

Are there subsets of the test suitethat are more suited to any particular textual en tailment recognition method?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We use several shallow surface features to model the text, hypothesis and their relation to each other.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Most importantly, we expect some dependencybetween surface string similarity of text and hypothesis and the existence of entailment.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Our string sim ilarity measure uses only a form of extended wordoverlap between text and hypothesis, taking into account equality of words, synonymy and morpholog ical derivations.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is usedas the knowledge source for synonymy and deriva tions.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
The exact procedure is as follows:Both text and hypothesis are tokenised and lem matised.,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"A lemma l1 in the hypothesis is said to be related to a lemma l2 in the text iff l1 and l2 are equal, belong to the same WordNet synset (e.g., ?murder?","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"

and ?murderer?),"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
or arerelated via a combination of synonymy and deriva tions (e.g. ?murder?,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
via ?murderer?,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
to ?liquidator?).,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"No word sense disambiguation is performed and all synsets for a particular lemma are considered.In addition, each lemma in the hypothesis is as signed its inverse document frequency, accessing the Web as corpus via the GoogleAPI, as its weight.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
This standard procedure allows us to assign more importance to less frequent words.,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
The overlap measure wnoverlap between text and hypothesis is initialised as zero.,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Should a lemma in the hypothesis be related to a lemma in the text, its weight is added to wnoverlap, otherwise it is ignored.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
In the end wnoverlap is normalised by dividing it by the sum of all weights of the lemmas in the hypothesis.,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
This ensures that wnoverlap isalways a real number between 0 and 1 and also en sures independence of the length of the hypothesis.,"{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Apart from wnoverlap we take into account length (as measured by number of lemmas) of text and hypothesis, because in most of the observed cases for true entailments the hypothesis is shorter than the text as it contains less information.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This is covered by three numerical features measuring the length of the text, of the hypothesis and the relative length of hypothesis with regard to the text.","{'title': 'Shallow Semantic Features. ', 'number': '2'}"

"While theorem provers are designed to prove that a formula is a theorem (i.e., that the formula is true in any model), they are generally not good at deciding that a formula is not a theorem.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
Model builders are designed to show that a formula is true in at least one model.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"To exploit these complementary approaches to inference, we use both a theorem prover and amodel builder for any inference problem: the theo rem prover attempts to prove the input whereas the model builder simultaneously tries to find a model for the negation of the input.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
If the model builder finds a model for ?FOL(DRS(T))?FOL(DRS(H)) (= ?A) we know that there can?t be a proof for its negation (hence no entailment).,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
And if the model builder is able to generate a model for FOL(DRS(T);DRS(H)) (= ?B)we know that T and H are consistent (maybe entailment).,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"(In practice, this is also a good way to termi nate the search for proofs or models: if the theorem prover finds a proof for ??, we can halt the model builder to try and find a model for ?","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"(because there won?t be one), and vice versa.)","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
Another attractive property of a model builder is that it outputs a model for its input formula (only of course if the input is satisfiable).,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"A model is here the logical notion of a model, describing a situation in which the input formula is true.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Formally, a model is a pair ?D,F ? where D is the set of entities in thedomain, and F a function mapping predicate sym bols to sets of domain members.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For instance, the model returned for fol(drs(T)) in Example 78 is one where the domain consists of three entities (domain size = 3): D = {d1,d2,d3} F(loc) = {} F(book) = {d1,d2} F(seller) = {} F(clinton) = {d3} F(be) = {} F(of) = {(d1,d3)} F(agent) = {} F(big) = {} F(patient) = {}Model builders like Paradox generate finite mod els by iteration.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis.

3.5 Approximating Entailment.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In an ideal world we calculate all the required back ground knowledge and by either finding a proof ora countermodel, decide how T and H relate with re spect to entailment.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"However, it is extremely hard to acquire all the required background knowledge.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"This is partly due to the limitations of word sense disambiguation, the lack of resources like WordNet, and the lack of general knowledge in a form suitable for automatic inference tasks.To introduce an element of robustness into our ap proach, we use the models as produced by the modelbuilders to measure the ?distance?","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
from an entail ment.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
The intuition behind it is as follows.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"If His entailed by T, the model for T+H is not informa tive compared to the one for T, and hence does not introduce new entities.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Put differently, the domain size for T+H would equal the domain size of T. Incontrast, if T does not entail H, H normally intro duce some new information (except when it contains negated information), and this will be reflected in the domain size of T+H, which then is larger than the domain size of T. It turns out that this differencebetween the domain sizes is a useful way of measur ing the likelihood of entailment.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Large differences are mostly not entailments, small differences mostly are.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
Consider the following example: 631 Example: 1049 (TRUE) T: Four Venezuelan firefighters who were traveling to a training course in Texas were killed when their sport utility vehicle drifted onto the shoulder of a highway and struck a parked truck.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"H: Four firefighters were killed in a car accident.Although this example is judged as a true entail ment, Vampire doesn?t find a proof because it lacks the background knowledge that one way of causing acar accident is to drift onto the shoulder of the high way and strike something.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis.

"It generates a model withdomain size 11 for fol(drs(T)), and a model with do main size 12 for fol((drs(T);drs(H))).","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The absolute difference in domain sizes is small, and thereforelikely to indicate an entailment.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
Apart from the absolute difference we also compute the difference rel ative to the domain size.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
For the example above the relative domain size yields 1/12 = 0.083.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
The domain size only tells us something about the number of entities used in a model?not about the number of established relations between the model?s entities.,"{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, we also introduce the notion ofmodel size.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The model size is defined here by count ing the number of all instances of two-place relations (and three-place relations, if there are any) in the model, and multiplying this with the domain size.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For instance, the following model D = {d1,d2,d3} F(cat) = {d1,d2} F(john) = {d3} F(of) = {(d1,d3)} F(like) = {(d3,d1),(d3,d2)} has a domain size of 3 and 3 instantiated two-place relations, yielding a model size of 3 ? 3 = 9.","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis. ', 'number': '3'}"

"The model builder gives us six features: domainsize and modelsize for T+H as well as the absolute and relative difference between the sizes of T and T+H, both for the size of the domains (domainsizeabsdif, domainsizereldif) and the size of the models (modelsizeabsdif, modelsizereldif).","{'title': 'Deep Semantic Analysis.

"It is similar to some of the recent approaches that were pro posed in the context of the PASCAL RTE workshop, i.e. using the OTTER theorem prover (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al, 2005), using EPILOG (Bayer et al., 2005), or abduction (Raina et al, 2005).","{'title': 'Related Work.

"None of these systems, however, incorporate model building as a central part of the inference mechanism.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
"We have shown that solely relying on theorem proving is normally insufficient due to low recall, and that using model builders is a promising way to approximate entailment.Results of other approaches to determining tex tual entailment indicate that it is an extremely hard 634 task.","{'title': 'Related Work.

Com paring this with our own results (accuracy 0.61 and cws 0.65) shows how well our systems performs onthe same data set.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
This is partly due to our hy brid approach which is more robust across different datasets.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
Relying on theorem proving as a technique for de termining textual entailment yielded high precision but low recall due to a general lack of appropriate background knowledge.,"{'title': 'Conclusions. ', 'number': '6'}"

Future work will be directed to the acquisition of targeted paraphrases that can be converted into background knowledge in the form of axioms.,"{'title': 'Conclusions. ', 'number': '6'}"
Our hybrid approach combines shallow analysis with both theorem proving and model building and achieves high accuracy scores on the RTE dataset compared to other systems that we are aware of.,"{'title': 'Conclusions. ', 'number': '6'}"
The results for this approach also indicate that (a) the choice of entailment recognition methods might have to vary according to the dataset design and/or application and (b) that a method that wants to achieve robust performance across different datasetsmight need the integration of several different entail ment recognition methods as well as an indicator of design methodology or application.,"{'title': 'Conclusions.
