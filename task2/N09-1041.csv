We present an exploration of generative probabilistic models for multi-document summarization.,{}
"Beginning with a simple word frequency based model (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), we construct a sequence of models each injecting more structure into the representation of document set content and exhibiting ROUGE gains along the way.",{}

"Over the past several years, there has been much interest in the task of multi-document summarization.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In the common Document Understanding Conference (DUC) formulation of the task, a system takes as input a document set as well as a short description of desired summary focus and outputs a word length limited summary.1 To avoid the problem of generating cogent sentences, many systems opt for an extractive approach, selecting sentences from the document set which best reflect its core content.2 There are several approaches to modeling document content: simple word frequency-based methods (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), graph-based approaches (Radev, 2004; Wan and Yang, 2006), as well as more linguistically motivated techniques (Mckeown et al., 1999; Leskovec et al., 2005; Harabagiu et al., 2007).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Another strand of work (Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Daum´e III and Marcu, 2006; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), has explored the use of structured probabilistic topic models to represent document content.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, little has been done to directly compare the benefit of complex content models to simpler surface ones for generic multi-document summarization.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this work we examine a series of content models for multi-document summarization and argue that LDA-style probabilistic topic models (Blei et al., 2003) can offer state-of-the-art summarization quality as measured by automatic metrics (see section 5.1) and manual user evaluation (see section 5.2).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We also contend that they provide convenient building blocks for adding more structure to a summarization model.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In particular, we utilize a variation of the hierarchical LDA topic model (Blei et al., 2004) to discover multiple specific ‘subtopics’ within a document set.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The resulting model, HIERSUM (see section 3.4), can produce general summaries as well as summaries for any of the learned sub-topics.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The task we will consider is extractive multidocument summarization.,"{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"In this task we assume a document collection D consisting of documents Di, ... , D,,, describing the same (or closely related) narrative (Lapata, 2003). set of events.","{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"Our task will be to propose a summary S consisting of sentences in D totaling at most L words.3 Here as in much extractive summarization, we will view each sentence as a bag-of-words or more generally a bag-of-ngrams (see section 5.1).","{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
The most prevalent example of this data setting is document clusters found on news aggregator sites.,"{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
For model development we will utilize the DUC 2006 evaluation set4 consisting of 50 document sets each with 25 documents; final evaluation will utilize the DUC 2007 evaluation set (section 5).,"{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"Automated evaluation will utilize the standard DUC evaluation metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004) which represents recall over various n-grams statistics from a system-generated summary against a set of humangenerated peer summaries.5 We compute ROUGE scores with and without stop words removed from peer and proposed summaries.","{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"In particular, we utilize R-1 (recall against unigrams), R-2 (recall against bigrams), and R-SU4 (recall against skip-4 bigrams)6.","{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"We present R-2 without stop words in the running text, but full development results are presented in table 1.","{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"
"Official DUC scoring utilizes the jackknife procedure and assesses significance using bootstrapping resampling (Lin, 2004).","{'title': '2 Experimental Setup', 'number': '2'}"

We present a progression of models for multidocument summarization.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Inference details are given in section 4.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The SUMBASIC algorithm, introduced in Nenkova and Vanderwende (2005), is a simple effective procedure for multi-document extractive summarization.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Its design is motivated by the observation that the relative frequency of a non-stop word in a document set is a good predictor of a word appearing in a human summary.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In SUMBASIC, each sentence where PD(·) initially reflects the observed unigram probabilities obtained from the document collection D. A summary S is progressively built by adding the highest scoring sentence according to (1).7 In order to discourage redundancy, the words in the selected sentence are updated PDnew (w) a til the summary word limit has been reached.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Despite its simplicity, SUMBASIC yields 5.3 R-2 without stop words on DUC 2006 (see table 1).8 By comparison, the highest-performing ROUGE system at the DUC 2006 evaluation, SUMFOCUS, was built on top of SUMBASIC and yielded a 6.0, which is not a statistically significant improvement (Vanderwende et al., 2007).9 Intuitively, SUMBASIC is trying to select a summary which has sentences where most words have high likelihood under the document set unigram distribution.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
One conceptual problem with this objective is that it inherently favors repetition of frequent non-stop words despite the ‘squaring’ update.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Ideally, a summarization criterion should be more recall oriented, penalizing summaries which omit moderately frequent document set words and quickly diminishing the reward for repeated use of word.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Another more subtle shortcoming is the use of the raw empirical unigram distribution to represent content significance.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"For instance, there is no distinction between a word which occurs many times in the same document or the same number of times across several documents.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Intuitively, the latter word is more indicative of significant document set content.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The KLSUM algorithm introduces a criterion for selecting a summary S given document collection D, where PS is the empirical unigram distribution of the candidate summary S and KL(P Q) represents the Kullback-Lieber (KL) divergence given by divergence between the true distribution P (here the document set unigram distribution) and the approximating distribution Q (the summary distribution).","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
This criterion casts summarization as finding a set of summary sentences which closely match the document set unigram distribution.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Lin et al. (2006) propose a related criterion for robust summarization evaluation, but to our knowledge this criteria has been unexplored in summarization systems.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
We address optimizing equation (2) as well as summary sentence ordering in section 4.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"KLSUM yields 6.0 R-2 without stop words, beating SUMBASIC but not with statistical significance.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"It is worth noting however that KLSUM’s performance matches SUMFOCUS (Vanderwende et al., 2007), the highest R-2 performing system at DUC 2006.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"As mentioned in section 3.2, the raw unigram distribution PD(·) may not best reflect the content of D for the purpose of summary extraction.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"We propose TOPICSUM, which uses a simple LDA-like topic model (Blei et al., 2003) similar to Daum´e III and Marcu (2006) to estimate a content distribu10In order to ensure finite values of KL-divergence we smoothe PS(·) so that it has a small amount of mass on all document set words. tion for summary extraction.11 We extract summary sentences as before using the KLSUM criterion (see equation (2)), plugging in a learned content distribution in place of the raw unigram distribution.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"First, we describe our topic model (see figure 1) which generates a collection of document sets.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"We assume a fixed vocabulary V :12 11A topic model is a probabilistic generative process that generates a collection of documents using a mixture of topic vocabulary distributions (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Note this usage of topic is unrelated to the summary focus given for document collections; this information is ignored by our models.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"12In contrast to previous models, stop words are not removed in pre-processing.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"13DIRICHLET(V,A) represents the symmetric Dirichlet prior distribution over V each with a pseudo-count of A.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Concrete pseudo-count values will be given in section 4.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
4.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"For each sentence S of each document D, draw a distribution ψT over topics (CONTENT, DOCSPECIFIC, BACKGROUND) from a Dirichlet prior with pseudo-counts (1.0, 5.0,10.0).14 For each word position in the sentence, we draw a topic Z from ψT, and a word W from the topic distribution Z indicates.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Our intent is that φC represents the core content of a document set.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Intuitively, φC does not include words which are common amongst several document collections (modeled with the BACKGROUND topic), or words which don’t appear across many documents (modeled with the DOCSPECIFIC topic).","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, because topics are tied together at the sentence level, words which frequently occur with other content words are more likely to be considered content words.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
We ran our topic model over the DUC 2006 document collections and estimated the distribution φC(·) for each document set.15 Then we extracted a summary using the KLSUM criterion with our estimated φC in place of the the raw unigram distribution.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Doing so yielded 6.3 R-2 without stop words (see TOPICSUM in table 1); while not a statistically significant improvement over KLSUM, it is our first model which outperforms SUMBASIC with statistical significance.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Daum´e III and Marcu (2006) explore a topic model similar to ours for query-focused multidocument summarization.16 Crucially however, Daum´e III and Marcu (2006) selected sentences with the highest expected number of CONTENT words.17 We found that in our model using this extraction criterion yielded 5.3 R-2 without stop words, significantly underperforming our TOPICSUM model.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"One reason for this may be that Daum´e III and Marcu (2006)’s criterion encourages selecting sentences which have words that are confidently generated by the CONTENT distribution, but not necessarily sentences which contain a plurality of it’s mass.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"TENT distribution by analytically integrating over φC (Blei et al., 2003), doing so gave no benefit.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Previous sections have treated the content of a document set as a single (perhaps learned) unigram distribution.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"However, as Barzilay and Lee (2004) observe, the content of document collections is highly structured, consisting of several topical themes, each with its own vocabulary and ordering preferences.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
For concreteness consider the DUC 2006 document collection describing the opening of Star Wars: Episode 1 (see figure 2(a)).,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"While there are words which indicate the general content of this document collection (e.g. star, wars), there are several sub-stories with their own specific vocabulary.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"For instance, several documents in this collection spend a paragraph or two talking about the financial aspect of the film’s opening and use a specific vocabulary there (e.g.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"$, million, record).","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"A user may be interested in general content of a document collection or, depending on his or her interests, one or more of the sub-stories.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
We choose to adapt our topic modeling approach to allow modeling this aspect of document set content.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Rather than drawing a single CONTENT distribution 0C for a document collection, we now draw a general content distribution 0C0 from DIRICHLET(V,AG) as well as specific content distributions 0Ci for i = 1, ... , K each from DIRICHLET(V,AS).18 Our intent is that 0C0 represents the 18We choose K=3 in our experiments, but one could flexibly general content of the document collection and each 0Ci represents specific sub-stories.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"As with TOPICSUM, each sentence has a distribution ψT over topics (BACKGROUND, DOCSPECIFIC, CONTENT).","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"When BACKGROUND or DOCSPECIFIC topics are chosen, the model works exactly as in TOPICSUM.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"However when the CONTENT topic is drawn, we must decide whether to emit a general content word (from 0C0) or from one of the specific content distributions (from one of 0Ci for i = 1, ... , K).","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
The generative story of TOPICSUM is altered as follows in this case: • General or Specific?,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
We must first decide whether to use a general or specific content word.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Each sentence draws a binomial distribution ψG determining whether a CONTENT word in the sentence will be drawn from the general or a specific topic distribution.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Reflecting the intuition that the earlier sentences in a document19 describe the general content of a story, we bias ψG to be drawn from BETA(5,2), preferring general content words, and every later sentence from BETA(1,2).20 emitting a topic specific content word, we must decide which of 0Cl, ... , 0CK to use.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"In order to ensure tight lexical cohesion amongst the specific topics, we assume that each sentence draws a single specific topic ZS used for every specific content word in that sentence.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Reflecting intuition that adjacent sentences are likely to share specific content vocabulary, we utilize a ‘sticky’ HMM as in Barzilay and Lee (2004) over the each sentences’ ZS.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Concretely, ZS for the first sentence in a document is drawn uniformly from 1, ... , K, and each subsequent sentence’s ZS will be identical to the previous sentence with probability Q, and with probability 1 − Q we select a successor topic from a learned transition distribution amongst 1, ... , K.21 Our intent is that the general content distribution 0C0 now prefers words which not only appear in many documents, but also words which appear consistently throughout a document rather than being concentrated in a small number of sentences.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
Each specific content distribution 0Ci is meant to model topics which are used in several documents but tend to be used in concentrated locations.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
HIERSUM can be used to extract several kinds of summaries.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
It can extract a general summary by plugging 0C0 into the KLSUM criterion.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
It can also produce topical summaries for the learned specific topics by extracting a summary over each 0Ci distribution; this might be appropriate for a user who wants to know more about a particular substory.,"{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"While we found the general content distribution (from 0Co) to produce the best single summary, we experimented with utilizing topical summaries for other summarization tasks (see section 6.1).","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"The resulting system, HIERSUM yielded 6.4 R-2 without stop words.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"While not a statistically significant improvement in ROUGE over TOPICSUM, we found the summaries to be noticeably improved.","{'title': '3 Summarization Models', 'number': '3'}"
"Since globally optimizing the KLSUM criterion in equation (equation (2)) is exponential in the total number of sentences in a document collection, we 21We choose σ = 0.75 in our experiments. opted instead for a simple approximation where sentences are greedily added to a summary so long as they decrease KL-divergence.","{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
"We attempted more complex inference procedures such as McDonald (2007), but these attempts only yielded negligible performance gains.","{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
"All summary sentence ordering was determined as follows: each sentence in the proposed summary was assigned a number in [0, 1] reflecting its relative sentence position in its source document, and sorted by this quantity.","{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
"All topic models utilize Gibbs sampling for inference (Griffiths, 2002; Blei et al., 2004).","{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
"In general for concentration parameters, the more specific a distribution is meant to be, the smaller its concentration parameter.","{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
"Accordingly for TOPICSUM, AG = AD = 1 and AC = 0.1.","{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
For HIERSUM we used AG = 0.1 and AS = 0.01.,"{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
These parameters were minimally tuned (without reference to ROUGE results) in order to ensure that all topic distribution behaved as intended.,"{'title': '4 Inference and Model Details', 'number': '4'}"
"We present formal experiments on the DUC 2007 data main summarization task, proposing a general summary of at most 250 words22 which will be evaluated automatically and manually in order to simulate as much as possible the DUC evaluation environment.23 DUC 2007 consists of 45 document sets, each consisting of 25 documents and 4 human reference summaries.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

"Although the differences in ROUGE between HIERSUM and TOPICSUM were minimal, we found HIERSUM summary quality to be stronger.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In order to provide a reference for ROUGE and manual evaluation results, we compare against PYTHY, a state-of-the-art supervised sentence extraction summarization system.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
PYTHY uses humangenerated summaries in order to train a sentence ranking system which discriminatively maximizes ROUGE scores.,"{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
PYTHY uses several features to rank sentences including several variations of the SUMBASIC score (see section 3.1).,"{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"At DUC 2007, PYTHY was ranked first overall in automatic ROUGE evaluation and fifth in manual content judgments.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

ROUGE results comparing variants of HIERSUM and PYTHY are given in table 3.,"{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"The HIERSUM system as described in section 3.4 yields 7.3 R-2 without stop words, falling significantly short of the 8.7 that PYTHY without simplification yields.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
Note that R-2 is a measure of bigram recall and HIERSUM does not represent bigrams whereas PYTHY includes several bigram and higher order n-gram statistics.,"{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In order to put HIERSUM and PYTHY on equalfooting with respect to R-2, we instead ran HIERSUM with each sentence consisting of a bag of bigrams instead of unigrams.24 All the details of the model remain the same.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Once a general content distribution over bigrams has been determined by hierarchical topic modeling, the KLSUM criterion is used as before to extract a summary.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"This system, labeled HIERSUM bigram in table 3, yields 9.3 R-2 without stop words, significantly outperforming HIERSUM unigram.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"This model outperforms PYTHY with and without sentence simplification, but not with statistical significance.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
We conclude that both PYTHY variants and HIERSUM bigram are comparable with respect to ROUGE performance.,"{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"24Note that by doing topic modeling in this way over bigrams, our model becomes degenerate as it can generate inconsistent bags of bigrams.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
Future work may look at topic models over n-grams as suggested by Wang et al. (2007).,"{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In order to obtain a more accurate measure of summary quality, we performed a simple user study.","{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

For this experiment we use the bigram variant of HIERSUM and compare it to PYTHY without simplification so both systems have the same set of possible output summaries.,"{'title': '5 Formal Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

"On the whole, HIERSUM summaries appear to be significantly less redundant than PYTHY and moderately less redundant than SUMBASIC.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
The reason for this might be that PYTHY is discriminatively trained to maximize ROUGE which does not directly penalize redundancy.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
Another tendency is for HIERSUM to select longer sentences typically chosen from an early sentence in a document.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"As discussed in section 3.4, HIERSUM is biased to consider early sentences in documents have a higher proportion of general content words and so this tendency is to be expected.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"

"While many variants of the general summarization task have been proposed which utilize such information (Vanderwende et al., 2007; Nastase, 2008), this presupposes that a user knows enough of the content of a document collection in order to propose a query.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
