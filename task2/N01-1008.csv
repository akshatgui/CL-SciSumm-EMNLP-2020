Section 2 discusses our text mining methodology for analysing the data and devising knowledgeminimalist rules for resolving the most popular coreference cases.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"

"The gender attributes may have the values: Gender attributes are assigned by the two following heuristics: Heuristic 1 If a collocation fom a WordNet synset contains the word male, the expression G for the whole sysnet is m. If the collocation contains the words female or woman, G= f .","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
Heuristic 2 Consider the first four words from the synset gloss.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"If any of the gloss words have been assigned gender information, propagate the same information to the defined synset as well.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"Each hyponym of the concept {person, individual, human}, categorized as PERSON has expression G initialized to f V m, since all lexemes represent persons, that can be either males or females.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"Whenever one of the two heuristics previously defined can be applied at any node S from this subhierarchy, three operations take place: t> Operation 1: We update G with the new expression brough forward by the heuristic. t> Operation 2: We propagate all the expression to the hyponyms of S; t> Operation 3: We revisit the whole PERSON subhierarchy, in search for concepts D that are defined with glosses that use any of the words from synset S or any word from any of its hyponyms.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"Whenever we find such a word, we update its G expression to G(S).","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"We also note that many words are polysemous, thus a word w may have multiple senses under the PERSON sub-hierarchy and moreover, each sense might have a different G expression.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"In this case, all words from the synsets containing w receive the disjunct of the gender attributes corresponding to each sense of w. Mining semantic information from WordNet We used the WordNet knowledge base to mine patterns of WordNet paths that connect pairs of coreferring nouns from the annotated chains.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
The paths are combinations of any of the following WordNet 6A polysemous noun has multiple semantic senses and therefore has multiple entries in the WordNet dictionary.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
To determine the confidence of the path we consider three factors: *Factor fi has only two values.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
It is set to 1 when another coreference chain contains elements in the same NPs as the anaphor and the anetcedent.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, if NPi is &quot;the professor's son&quot; and NP2 is &quot;his father&quot;, the semantic consistency between father and professor is more likely, given that his and son corefer.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"Otherwise, fi is set to 0.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
*Factor f2 favors (a) relations that are considered &quot;stronger&quot; (e.g.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"SYNONYMY, GLOSS); and (b) shorter paths.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
For this purpose we assign the following weights to each relation considered: W(SYNONYM) = 1.0; w(IS-A) = 0.9; w(GLoss) = 0.9; w(IN-GLoss) = 0.3; w(HAs-PART) = 0.7; w(MoRPHo-DERIVATION) = 0.6; and W(COLLIDESENSE) = 0.5.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"When computing the f2 factor, we assume that whenever at least two relations of the same kind repeat, we should consider the sequence of relations equivalent to a single relation, having the weight devided by the length of the sequence.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"If we denote by rir„i the number of different relation types encountered in a path, and rirsame(rel) denotes the number of links of type rel in a sequence, then we define f2 with the formula: *Factor h is a semantic measure operating on a conceptual space.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"When searching for a lexico-semantic path, a search space SS is created, which contains all WordNet content words that can be reached from the candidate antecedent or the anaphor in at most five combinations of the seven relations used by the third filter.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
We denote by N the total number of nouns and verbs in the search space.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
C represents the number of nouns and verbs that can be reached by both nominals.,"{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
"In addition rirtotal is the number of concepts along all paths established, whereas (Riloff and Jones 1999) note that the performance of the mutual bootstrapping algorithm can deteriorate rapidly if erroneous rules are entered.","{'title': '1 Background', 'number': '1'}"
