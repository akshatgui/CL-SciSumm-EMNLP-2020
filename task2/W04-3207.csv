This inference task is carried out by a bilingual parser.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"At present, the model used for parsing is completely factored into the two parsers and the TM, allowing separate parameter estimation.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"First, we discuss bilingual parsing (§2) and show how it can solve the problem of joint English-parse, L-parse, and word-alignment inference.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In §3 we describe parameter estimation for each of the factored models, including novel applications of log-linear models to English dependency parsing and Korean morphological analysis.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"§4 presents Korean parsing results with various monolingual and bilingual algorithms, including our bilingual parsing algorithm.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We close by reviewing prior work in areas related to this paper (§5).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The joint model used by our bilingual parser is an instance of a stochastic bilingual multitext grammar (2MTG), formally defined by Melamed (2003).","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
The 2MTG formalism generates two strings such that each syntactic constituent—including individual words—in one side of the bitext corresponds either to a constituent in the other side or to ∅.,"{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"Melamed defines bilexicalized MTG (L2MTG), which is a synchronous extension of bilexical grammars such as those described in Eisner and Satta (1999) and applies the latter’s algorithmic speedups to L2MTG-parsing.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
Our formalism is not a precise fit to either unlexicalized MTG or L2MTG since we posit lexical dependency structure only in one of the languages (English).,"{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
The primary rationale for this is that we are dealing with only a small quantity of labeled data in language L and therefore do not expect to be able to accurately estimate its lexical affinities.,"{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"Further, synchronous parsing is in practice computationally expensive, and eliminating lexicalization on one side reduces the run-time of the parser from O(n8) to O(n7).","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
Our parsing algorithm is a simple transformation of Melamed’s R2D parser that eliminates head information in all Korean parser items.,"{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"The model event space for our stochastic “halfbilexicalized” 2-MTG consists of rewrite rules of the following two forms, with English above and L below: where upper-case symbols are nonterminals and lowercase symbols are words (potentially ∅).","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"One approach to assigning a probability to such a rule is to make an independence assumption, for example: There are two powerful reasons to model the bilingual grammar in this factored way.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"First, we know of no treealigned corpora from which bilingual rewrite probabilities could be estimated; this rules out the possibility of supervised training of the joint rules.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"Second, separating the probabilities allows separate estimation of the probabilities—resulting in two well-understood parameter estimation tasks which can be carried out independently.1 This factored modeling approach bears a strong resemblance to the factored monolingual parser of Klein and Manning (2002), which combined an English dependency model and an unlexicalized PCFG.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
The generative model used by Klein and Manning consisted of multiplying the two component models; the model was therefore deficient.,"{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"We go a step farther, replacing the deficient generative model with a log-linear model.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"The underlying parsing algorithm remains the same, but the weights are no longer constrained to sum to one.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"(Hereafter, we assume weights are additive real values; a log-probability is an example of a weight.)","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"The weights may be estimated using discriminative training (as we do for the English model, §3.1) or as if they were log-probabilities, using smoothed maximum likelihood estimation (as we do for the Korean model, §3.3).","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"Because we use this model only for inference, it is not necessary to compute a partition function for the combined log-linear model.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition to the two monolingual syntax models, we add a word-to-word translation model to the mix.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"In this paper we use a translation model to induce only a single best word matching, but in principle the translation model could be used to weight all possible wordword links, and the parser would solve the joint alignment/parsing problem.2 As a testbed for our experiments, the Penn Korean Treebank (KTB; Han et al., 2002) provides 5,083 Korean constituency trees along with English translations and their trees.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"The KTB also analyzes Korean words into their component morphemes and morpheme tags, which allowed us to train a morphological disambiguation model.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"To make the most of this small corpus, we performed all our evaluations using five-fold cross-validation.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"Due to the computational expense of bilingual parsing, we produced a sub-corpus of the KTB limiting English sentence length to 10 words, or 27% of the full data.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"We then randomized the order of sentences and divided the data into five equal test sets of 280 sentences each (≈1,700 Korean words, ≈2,100 English words).","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
"Complementing each test set, the remaining data were used for training sets of increasing size to simulate various levels of data scarcity.","{'title': '2 Bilingual parsing', 'number': '2'}"
We now describe parameter estimation for the four component models that combine to make our full system (Table 1).,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Our English syntax model is based on weighted bilexical dependencies.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"The model predicts the generation of a child (POS tag, word) pair, dependent upon its parent (tag, word) and the tag of the parent’s most recent child on the same side (left or right).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"These events correspond quite closely to the parser described by Eisner’s (1996) model C, but instead of the rules receiving conditional probabilities, we use a log-linear model and allow arbitrary weights.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"The model does not predict POS tags; it assumes they are given, even in test.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that the dynamic program used for inference of bilexical parses is indifferent to the origin of the rule weights; they could be log-probabilities or arbitrary numbers, as in our model.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The parsing algorithm need not change to accommodate the new parameterization.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"In this model, the probability of a (sentence, tree) pair (E, T) is given by: where 0 are the model parameters and f is a vector function such that fi is equal to the number of times a feature (e.g., a production rule) fires in (E, T).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Parameter estimation consists of selecting weights 0 to maximize the conditional probability of the correct parses given observed sentences:3 Another important advantage of moving to log-linear models is the simple handling of data sparseness.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The feature templates used by our model are shown in Table 2.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The first feature corresponds to the fully-described child-generation event; others are similar but less informative.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"These “overlapping” features offer a kind of backoff, so that each child-generation event’s weight receives a contribution from several granularities of description.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"

"If a feature is never seen in training data, we give it the same weight as the minimum-valued feature from the training set (Bmin).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"To handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, we treat any word seen for the first time in the final 300 sentences of the training corpus as OOV.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The model is smoothed using a Gaussian prior with unit variance on every weight.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Because the left and right children of a parent are independent of each other, our model can be described as a weighted split head automaton grammar (Eisner and Satta, 1999).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"This allowed us to use Eisner and Satta’s O(n3) parsing algorithm to speed up training.4 This speedup could not, however, be applied to the bilingual parsing algorithm since a split parsing algorithm will preclude inference of certain configurations of word alignments that are allowed by a non-split parser (Melamed, 2003).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"We trained the parser on sentences of 15 words or fewer in the WSJ Treebank sections 01–21.5 99.49% dependency attachment accuracy was achieved on the training set, and 76.68% and 75.00% were achieved on sections 22 and 23, respectively.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Performance on the English side of our KTB test set was 71.82% (averaged across 5 folds, u = 1.75).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"This type of discriminative training has been applied to log-linear variants of hidden Markov models (Lafferty et al., 2001) and to lexical-functional grammar (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"To our knowledge, it has not been explored for context-free models (including bilexical dependency models like ours).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
A review of discriminative approaches to parsing can be found in Chiang (2003).,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"A Korean word typically consists of a head morpheme followed by a series of closed-class dependent morphemes such as case markers, copula, topicalizers, and conjunctions.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Since most of the semantic content resides in the leading head morpheme, we eliminate for word alignment all trailing morphemes, which reduces the KTB’s vocabulary size from 10,052 to 3,104.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Existing morphological processing tools for many languages are often unweighted finite-state transducers that encode the possible analyses for a surface form word.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"One such tool, klex, is available for Korean (Han, 2004).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Unfortunately, while the unweighted FST describes the set of valid analyses, it gives no way to choose among them.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"We treat this as a noisy channel: Korean morpheme-tag pairs are generated in sequence by some process, then passed through a channel that turns them into Korean words (with loss of information).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"The channel is given by the FST, but without any weights.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"To select the best output, we model the source process.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
We model the sequence of morphemes and their tags as a log-linear trigram model.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Overlapping trigram, bigram, and unigram features provide backoff information to deal with data sparseness (Table 3).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"For each training sentence, we used the FST-encoded morphological dictionary to construct a lattice of possible analyses.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The lattice has a “sausage” form with all paths joining between each word.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
We train the feature weights to maximize the weight of the correct path relative to all paths in the lattice.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"In contrast, Lafferty et al. (2001) train to maximize the the probability of the tags given the words.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Over training sentences, maximize: where Ti is the correct tagging for sentence i, Mi is the correct morpheme sequence.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
There are a few complications.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"First, the coverage of the FST is of course not universal; in fact, it cannot analyze 4.66% of word types (2.18% of tokens) in the KTB.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
We tag such words as atomic common nouns (the most common tag).,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, many of the analyses in the KTB are not admitted by the FST: 21.06% of correct analyses (by token) are not admitted by the FST; 6.85% do not have an FST analysis matching in the first tag and morpheme, 3.63% do not have an FST analysis matching the full tag sequence, and 1.22% do not have an analysis matching the first tag.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
These do not include the 2.18% of tokens with no analysis at all.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"When this happened in training, we added the correct analysis to the lattice.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"To perform inference on new data, we construct a lattice from the FST (adding in any analyses of the word seen in training) and use a dynamic program (essentially the Viterbi algorithm) to find the best path through the lattice.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Unseen features are given the weight Bmin.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Table 4 shows performance on ambiguous tokens in training and test data (averaged over five folds).,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Because we are using small training sets, parameter estimates for a lexicalized Korean probabilistic grammar are likely to be highly unreliable due to sparse data.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Therefore we use an unlexicalized PCFG.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Because the POS tags are given by the morphological analyzer, the PCFG need not predict words (i.e., head morphemes), only POS tags.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Rule probabilities were estimated with MLE.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Since only the sentence nonterminal S was smoothed (using add-0.1), the grammar could parse any sequence of tags but was relatively sparse, which kept bilingual run-time down.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"6 When we combine the PCFG with the other models to do joint bilingual parsing, we simply use the logs of the PCFG probabilities as if they were log-linear weights.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
A PCFG treated this way is a perfectly valid log-linear model; the exponentials of its weights just happen to satisfy certain sum-to-one constraints.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"In the spirit of joint optimization, we might have also combined the Korean morphology and syntax models into one inference task.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"We did not do this, largely out of concerns over computational expense (see the discussion of translation models in §3.4).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"This parser, independent of the bilingual parser, is evaluated in §4.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"In our bilingual parser, the English and Korean parses are mediated through word-to-word translational correspondence links.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Unlike the syntax models, the translation models were trained without the benefit of labeled data.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"We used the GIZA++ implementation of the IBM statistical translation models (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"To obtain reliable word translation estimates, we trained on a bilingual corpus in addition to the KTB training set.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"The Foreign Broadcast Information Service dataset contains about 99,000 sentences of Korean and 72,000 of English translation.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"For our training, we extracted a relatively small parallel corpus of about 19,000 high-confidence sentence pairs.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"As noted above, Korean’s productive agglutinative morphology leads to sparse estimates of word frequencies.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"We therefore trained our translation models after replacing each Korean word with its first morpheme stripped of its closed-class dependent morphemes, as described in §3.2.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The size of the translation tables made optimal bilingual parsing prohibitive by exploding the number of possible analyses.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
We therefore resorted to using GIZA++’s hypothesized alignments.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Since the IBM models only hypothesize one-to-many alignments from target to source, we trained using each side of the bitext as source and target in turn.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
We could then produce two kinds of alignment graphs by taking either the intersection or the union of the links in the two GIZA++ alignment graphs.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
All words not in the resulting alignment graph are set to align to ∅.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Our bilingual parser deals only in one-to-one alignments (mappings); the intersection graph yields a mapping.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The union graph yields a set of links which may permit different one-to-one mappings.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Using the union graph therefore allows for flexibility in the word alignments inferred by the bilingual parser, but this comes at computational expense (because more analyses are permitted).","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Even with over 20,000 sentence pairs of training data, the hypothesized alignments are relatively sparse.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"For the intersection alignments, an average of 23% of nonpunctuation Korean words and 17% of non-punctuation English words have a link to the other language.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"For the union alignments, this improves to 88% for Korean and 22% for English.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
A starker measure of alignment sparsity is the accuracy of English dependency links projected onto Korean.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Following Hwa et al. (2002), we looked at dependency links in the true English parses from the KTB where both the dependent and the head were linked to words on the Korean side using the intersection alignment.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that Hwa et al. used not only the true English trees, but also hand-produced alignments.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
"If we hypothesize that, if English words i and j are in a parent-child relationship, then so are their linked Korean words, then we infer an incomplete dependency graph for the Korean sentences whose precision is around 49%–53% but whose recall is standard deviations) are shown over five-fold cross-validation.","{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
Over 65% of word tokens are ambiguous.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"
The accuracy of the first tag in each word affects the PCFG and the accuracy of the first morpheme affects the translation model (under our aggressive morphological lemmatization). an abysmal 2.5%–3.6%.,"{'title': '3 Parameter estimation', 'number': '3'}"

"Since unary productions do not translate well from language to language (Hwa et al., 2002), we collapse them to their lower nodes.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
We compare our bilingual parser to several baseline systems.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"The first is the Korean PCFG trained on the small KTB training sets, as described in §3.3.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
We also consider Wu’s (1997) stochastic inversion transduction grammar (SITG) as well as strictly left- and right-branching trees.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
We report the results of five-fold cross-validation with the mean and standard deviation (in parentheses).,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Since it is unlexicalized, the PCFG parses sequences of tags as output by the morphological analysis model.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"By contrast, we can build translation tables for the SITG directly from surface words—and thus not use any labeled training data at all—or from the sequence of head morphemes.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Experiments showed, however, that the SITG using words consistently outperformed the SITG using morphemes.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
We also implemented Wu’s treetransformation algorithm to turn full binary-branching SITG output into flatter trees.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Finally, we can provide extra information to the SITG by giving it a set of English bracketings that it must respect when constructing the joint tree.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"To get an upper bound on performance, we used the true parses from the English side of the KTB.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Only the PCFG, of course, can be evaluated on labeled bracketing (Table 6).","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Although labeled precision and recall on test data generally increase with more training data, the slightly lower performance at the highest training set size may indicate overtraining of this simple model.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
Unlabeled precision and recall show continued improvement with more Korean training data.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Even with help from the true English trees, the unsupervised SITGs underperform PCFGs trained on as few as 32 sentences, with the exception of unlabeled recall in one experiment.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
It seems that even some small amount of knowledge of the language helps parsing.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
Crossing brackets for the flattened SITG parses are understandably lower.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"The output of our bilingual parser contains three types of constituents: English-only (aligned to 0), Korean-only (aligned to 0), and bilingual.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
The Korean parse induced by the Korean-only and bilingual constituents is filtered so constituents with intermediate labels (generated by the binarization process) are eliminated.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
A second filter we consider is to keep only the (remaining) bilingual constituents corresponding to an English head word’s maximal span.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
This filter will eliminate constituents whose English correspondent is a head word with some (but not all) of its dependents.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
Such partial English constituents are by-products of the parsing and do not correspond to the modeled syntax.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"With good word alignments, the English parser can help disambiguate Korean phrase boundaries and overcome erroneous morphological analyses (Table 5).","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
Results without and with the second filter are shown in Table 7.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Because larger training datasets lead to larger PCFGs (with more rules), the grammar constant increases.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Our bilingual parser implementation is on the cusp of practicality (in terms of memory requirements); when the grammar constant increased, we were unable to parse longer sentences.","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
"Therefore the results given for bilingual parsing are on reduced test sets, where a length filter was applied: sentences with |E |+ |F |> T were removed, for varying values of T. While neither bilingual parser consistently beats the PCFG on its own, they offer slight, complementary improvements on small training datasets of 32 and 64 sentences (Table 7).","{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
The bilingual parser without the English head span filter gives a small recall improvement on average at similar precision.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
Neither of these differences is significant when measured with a paired-sample t-test.,"{'title': '4 Evaluation', 'number': '4'}"
