"We offer a simple, effective, and scalable method for statistical machine translation parameter tuning based on the pairwise approach to ranking (Herbrich et al., 1999).",{}
"Unlike the popular MERT algorithm (Och, 2003), our pairwise ranking optimization (PRO) method is not limited to a handful of parameters and can easily handle systems with thousands of features.",{}

"Tellingly, in the entire proceedings of ACL 2010 (Hajiˇc et al., 2010), only one paper describing a statistical MT system cited the use of MIRA for tuning (Chiang, 2010), while 15 used MERT.1 Here we propose a simpler approach to tuning that scales similarly to high-dimensional feature spaces.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We cast tuning as a ranking problem (Chen et al., 2009), where the explicit goal is to learn to correctly rank candidate translations.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Specifically, we follow the pairwise approach to ranking (Herbrich et al., 1999; Freund et al., 2003; Burges et al., 2005; Cao et al., 2007), in which the ranking problem is reduced to the binary classification task of deciding between candidate translation pairs.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Of primary concern to us is the ease of adoption of our proposed technique.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Because of this, we adhere as closely as possible to the established MERT architecture and use freely available machine learning software.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The end result is a technique that scales and performs just as well as MIRA-based tuning, but which can be implemented in a couple of hours by anyone with an existing MERT implementation.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Mindful that many would-be enhancements to the state-of-the-art are false positives that only show improvement in a narrowly defined setting or with limited data, we validate our claims on both syntax and phrase-based systems, using multiple language pairs and large data sets.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We describe tuning in abstract and somewhat formal terms in Section 2, describe the MERT algorithm in the context of those terms and illustrate its scalability issues via a synthetic experiment in Section 3, introduce our pairwise ranking optimization method in Section 4, present numerous large-scale MT experiments to validate our claims in Section 5, discuss some related work in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In Figure 1, we show an example candidate space, defined as a tuple (A, I, J, f, e, x) where: The example candidate space has two source sentences, three candidate translations for each source sentence, and feature vectors of dimension 2.","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"It is an example of a finite candidate space, defined as a candidate space for which I is finite and J maps each index of I to a finite set.","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"A policy of candidate space (A, I, J, f, e, x) is a function that maps each member i E I to a member of J(i).","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
A policy corresponds to a choice of one candidate translation for each source sentence.,"{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"For the example in Figure 1, policy p1 = 11 �-+ 2, 2 �-+ 31 corresponds to the choice of “he does not go” for the first source sentence and “I do not go” for the second source sentence.","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
Obviously some policies are better than others.,"{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"Policy p2 = 11 �-+ 3, 2 �-+ 11 corresponds to the inferior translations “she not go” and “I go not.” We assume the MT system distinguishes between policies using a scoring function for candidate translations of the form hw(i, j) = w · x(i, j), where w is a weight vector of the same dimension as feature vector x(i, j).","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"This scoring function extends to a policy p by summing the cost of each of the policy’s candidate translations: Hw(p) = Ei∈I hw(i, p(i)).","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"As can be seen in Figure 1, using w = [−2, 1], Hw(p1) = 9 and Hw(p2) = −8.","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"The goal of tuning is to learn a weight vector w such that Hw(p) assigns a high score to good policies, and a low score to bad policies.2 To do so, we need information about which policies are good and which are bad.","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
This information is provided by a “gold” scoring function G that maps each policy to a real-valued score.,"{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"Typically this gold function is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), though there are several common alternatives (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009; Melamed et al., 2003; Snover et al., 2006; Chiang et al., 2008a).","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"We want to find a weight vector w such that Hw behaves “similarly” to G on a candidate space s. We assume a loss function ls(Hw, G) which returns the real-valued loss of using scoring function Hw when the gold scoring function is G and the candidate space is s. Thus, we may say the goal of tuning is to find the weight vector w that minimizes loss.","{'title': '2 Tuning', 'number': '2'}"
"In general, the candidate space may have infinitely many source sentences, as well as infinitely many candidate translations per source sentence.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"In practice, tuning optimizes over a finite subset of source sentences3 and a finite subset of candidate translations as well.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"The classic tuning architecture used in the dominant MERT approach (Och, 2003) forms the translation subset and learns weight vector w via Algorithm TUNE(s, G): space s = hA, I, J, f, e, xi w.r.t. gold function G. a feedback loop consisting of two phases.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
Figure 2 shows the pseudocode.,"{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"During candidate generation, candidate translations are selected from a base candidate space s and added to a finite candidate space s0 called the candidate pool.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"During optimization, the weight vector w is optimized to minimize loss ls,(Hw, G).","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"For its candidate generation phase, MERT generates the k-best candidate translations for each source sentence according to hw, where w is the weight vector from the previous optimization phase (or an arbitrary weight vector for the first iteration).","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"For its optimization phase, MERT defines the loss function as follows: In other words, it prefers weight vectors w such that the gold function G scores Hw’s best policy as highly as possible (if Hw’s best policy is the same as G’s best policy, then there is zero loss).","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
Typically the optimization phase is implemented using Och’s line optimization algorithm (2003).,"{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
MERT has proven itself effective at tuning candidate spaces with low dimensionality.,"{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"However, it is often claimed that MERT does not scale well with dimensionality.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"To test this claim, we devised the following synthetic data experiment: We used line optimization in the standard way, by generating 20 random starting weight vectors and hill-climbing on each independently until no further progress is made, then choosing the final weight vector that minimizes loss.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
We tried various dimensionalities from 10 to 1000.,"{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"We repeated each setting three times, generating different random data each time.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
The results in Figure 3 indicate that as the dimensionality of the problem increases MERT rapidly loses the ability to learn w∗.,"{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"Note that this synthetic problem is considerably easier than a real MT scenario, where the data is noisy and interdependent, and the gold scoring function is nonlinear.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
"If MERT cannot scale in this simple scenario, it has little hope of succeeding in a high-dimensionality deployment scenario.","{'title': '3 MERT', 'number': '3'}"
We would like to modify MERT so that it scales well to high-dimensionality candidate spaces.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
The most prominent example of a tuning method that performs well on high-dimensionality candidate spaces is the MIRA-based approach used by Watanabe et al. (2007) and Chiang et al.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
(2008b; 2009).,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Unfortunately, this approach requires a complex architecture that diverges significantly from the MERT approach, and consequently has not been widely adopted.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
Our goal is to achieve the same performance with minimal modification to MERT.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"With MERT as a starting point, we have a choice: modify candidate generation, optimization, or both.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Although alternative candidate generation methods have been proposed (Macherey et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2008b; Chatterjee and Cancedda, 2010), we will restrict ourselves to MERT-style candidate generation, in order to minimize divergence from the established MERT tuning architecture.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Instead, we focus on the optimization phase.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"While intuitive, the MERT optimization module focuses attention on Hw’s best policy, and not on its overall prowess at ranking policies.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
We will create an optimization module that directly addresses Hw’s ability to rank policies in the hope that this more holistic approach will generalize better to unseen data.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Assume that the gold scoring function G decomposes in the following way: where g(i, j) is a local scoring function that scores the single candidate translation e(i, j).","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
We show an example g in Figure 1.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"For an arbitrary pair of candidate translations e(i, j) and e(i, j'), the local gold function g tells us which is the better translation.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
Note that this induces a ranking on the candidate translations for each source sentence.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"We follow the pairwise approach to ranking (Herbrich et al., 1999; Freund et al., 2003; Burges et al., 2005; Cao et al., 2007).","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"In the pairwise approach, the learning task is framed as the classification of candidate pairs into two categories: correctly ordered and incorrectly ordered.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Specifically, for candidate translation pair e(i, j) and e(i, j'), we want: g(i,j) > g(i,j') ⇔ hw(i,j) > hw(i,j').","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
We can re-express this condition: Thus optimization reduces to a classic binary classification problem.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"We create a labeled training instance for this problem by computing difference vector x(i, j) − x(i, j'), and labeling it as a positive or negative instance based on whether, respectively, the first or second vector is superior according to gold function g. To ensure balance, we consider both possible difference vectors from a pair.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, given the candidate space of Figure 1, since g(1,1) > g(1, 3), we would add ([−4, 3], +) and ([4, −3], −) to our training set.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"We can then feed this training data directly to any off-the-shelf classification tool that returns a linear classifier, in order to obtain a weight vector w that optimizes the above condition.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
This weight vector can then be used directly by the MT system in the subsequent candidate generation phase.,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"The exact loss function ls,(Hw, G) optimized depends on the choice of classifier.4 Typical approaches to pairwise ranking enumerate all difference vectors as training data.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"For tuning however, this means O(|I |∗ J2max) vectors, where Jmax is the cardinality of the largest J(i).","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Since I and Jmax commonly range in the thousands, a full enumeration would produce billions of feature vectors.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Out of tractability considerations, we sample from the space of difference vectors, using the sampler template in Figure 4.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"For each source sentence i, the sampler generates F candidate translation pairs hj, j'i, and accepts each pair with probability αi(|g(i,j) − g(i, j')|).","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Among the accepted pairs, it keeps the Ξ with greatest g differential, and adds their difference vectors to the training data.5 We repeated the scalability study from Section 3, now using our pairwise ranking optimization (hereafter, PRO) approach.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Throughout all experiments with PRO we choose Γ = 5000, Ξ = 50, and the following step function α for each αz: 6 We used MegaM III, 2004) as a binary classifier in our contrasting synthetic experiment and of the i.e., with all default settings for binary Figure 3 shows that PRO is able to learn nearly perfectly at all dimensionalities from 10 to 1000.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"

"We obtained similar results using P = = 100, and for each a logistic sigmoid function centered at the mean g differential of candidate translation pairs for the ith source sentence.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"This alternative approach has the advantage of being agnostic about which gold scoring function is used. the sampling settings previously described and MegaM as our classifier we were able to optimize two to three times faster than with but added noise to each feature vector, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian with a standard deviation of 500.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"The results of the noisy synthetic experiments, but still The idea of learning from difference vectors also lies at the heart of the MIRA-based approaches (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang et al., 2008b) and the approach of Roth et al.

"Here, we isolate these aspects of those approaches to create a simpler tuning technique that closely mirrors the ubiquitous MERT architecture.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
"Among other simplifications, we abstract away the choice of MIRA as the classification method (our approach can use any classification technique that learns a separating hyperplane), and we eliminate the need for oracle translations.","{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
An important observation is that BLEU does not satisfy the decomposability assumption of Equation (1).,"{'title': '4 Optimization via Pairwise Ranking', 'number': '4'}"
