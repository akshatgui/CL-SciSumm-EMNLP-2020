Open Mind Word Expert is an implemented active learning system for collecting word sense tagging from the general public over the Web.,{}
It is available at http://teach-computers.org.,{}
We expect the system to yield a large volume of high-quality training data at a much lower cost than the traditional method of hiring lexicographers.,{}
We thus propose a Senseval-3 lexical sample activity where the training data is collected via Open Mind Word Expert.,{}
"If successful, the collection process can be extended to create the definitive corpus of word sense information.",{}
Most of the efforts in the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) field have concentrated on supervised learning algorithms.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
These methods usually achieve the best performance at the cost of low recall.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The main weakness of these methods is the lack of widely available semantically tagged corpora and the strong dependence of disambiguation accuracy on the size of the training corpus.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The tagging process is usually done by trained lexicographers, and consequently is quite expensive, limiting the size of such corpora to a handful of tagged texts.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This paper introduces Open Mind Word Expert, a Web-based system that aims at creating large sense tagged corpora with the help of Web users.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The system has an active learning component, used for selecting the most difficult examples, which are then presented to the human taggers.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We expect that the system will yield more training data of comparable quality and at a significantly lower cost than the traditional method of hiring lexicographers.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Open Mind Word Expert is a newly born project that follows the Open Mind initiative (Stork, 1999).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The basic idea behind Open Mind is to use the information and knowledge that may be collected from the existing millions of Web users, to the end of creating more intelligent software.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This idea has been used in Open Mind Common Sense, which acquires commonsense knowledge from people.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A knowledge base of about 400,000 facts has been built by learning facts from 8,000 Web users, over a one year period (Singh, 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"If Open Mind Word Expert experiences a similar learning rate, we expect to shortly obtain a corpus that exceeds the size of all previously tagged data.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"During the first fifty days of activity, we collected about 26,000 tagged examples without significant efforts for publicizing the site.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We expect this rate to gradually increase as the site becomes more widely known and receives more traffic.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The availability of large amounts of semantically tagged data is crucial for creating successful WSD systems.,"{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Yet, as of today, only few sense tagged corpora are publicly available.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"One of the first large scale hand tagging efforts is reported in (Miller et al., 1993), where a subset of the Brown corpus was tagged with WordNet senses.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The corpus includes a total of 234,136 tagged word occurrences, out of which 186,575 are polysemous.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"There are 88,058 noun occurrences of which 70,214 are polysemous.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The next significant hand tagging task was reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), where 2,476 usages of interest were manually assigned with sense tags from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE).","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"This corpus was used in various experiments, with classification accuracies ranging from 75% to 90%, depending on the algorithm and features employed.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The high accuracy of the LEXAS system (Ng and Lee, 1996) is due in part to the use of large corpora.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"For this system, 192,800 word occurrences have been manually tagged with senses from WordNet.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
The set of tagged words consists of the 191 most frequently occurring nouns and verbs.,"{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
The authors mention that approximately one man-year of effort was spent in tagging the data set.,"{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Lately, the SENSEVAL competitions provide a good environment for the development of supervised WSD systems, making freely available large amounts of sense tagged data for about 100 words.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"During SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000), data for 35 words was made available adding up to about 20,000 examples tagged with respect to the Hector dictionary.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The size of the tagged corpus increased with SENSEVAL-2 (Kilgarriff, 2001), when 13,000 additional examples were released for 73 polysemous words.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"This time, the semantic annotations were performed with respect to WordNet.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Additionally, (Kilgarriff, 1998) mentions the Hector corpus, which comprises about 300 word types with 300-1000 tagged instances for each word, selected from a 17 million word corpus.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
Sense tagged corpora have thus been central to accurate WSD systems.,"{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Estimations made in (Ng, 1997) indicated that a high accuracy domain independent system for WSD would probably need a corpus of about 3.2 million sense tagged words.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"At a throughput of one word per minute (Edmonds, 2000), this would require about 27 manyears of human annotation effort.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"With Open Mind Word Expert we aim at creating a very large sense tagged corpus, by making use of the incredible resource of knowledge constituted by the millions of Web users, combined with techniques for active learning.","{'title': '2 Sense Tagged Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
Open Mind Word Expert is a Web-based interface where users can tag words with their WordNet senses.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
Tagging is organized by word.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"That is, for each ambiguous word for which we want to build a sense tagged corpus, users are presented with a set of natural language (English) sentences that include an instance of the ambiguous word.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Initially, example sentences are extracted from a large textual corpus.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"If other training data is not available, a number of these sentences are presented to the users for tagging in Stage 1.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Next, this tagged collection is used as training data, and active learning is used to identify in the remaining corpus the examples that are “hard to tag”.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
These are the examples that are presented to the users for tagging in Stage 2.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"For all tagging, users are asked to select the sense they find to be the most appropriate in the given sentence, from a drop-down list that contains all WordNet senses, plus two additional choices, “unclear” and “none of the above”.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The results of any automatic classification or the classification submitted by other users are not presented so as to not bias the contributor’s decisions.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Based on early feedback from both researchers and contributors, a future version of Open Mind Word Expert may allow contributors to specify more than one sense for any word.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
A prototype of the system has been implemented and is available at http://www.teachcomputers.org.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Figure 1 shows a screen shot from the system interface, illustrating the screen presented to users when tagging the noun “child”.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"The starting corpus we use is formed by a mix of three different sources of data, namely the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), the Los Angeles Times collection, as provided during TREC conferences1, and Open Mind Common Sense2, a collection of about 400,000 commonsense assertions in English as contributed by volunteers over the Web.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"A mix of several sources, each covering a different spectrum of usage, is used to increase the coverage of word senses and writing styles.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"While the first two sources are well known to the NLP community, the Open Mind Common Sense constitutes a fairly new textual corpus.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
It consists mostly of simple single sentences.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"These sentences tend to be explanations and assertions similar to glosses of a dictionary, but phrased in a more common language and with many sentences per sense.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the collection includes such assertions as “keys are used to unlock doors”, and “pressing a typewriter key makes a letter”.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
We believe these sentences may be a relatively clean source of keywords that can aid in disambiguation.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"For details on the data and how it has been collected, see (Singh, 2002).","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"To minimize the amount of human annotation effort needed to build a tagged corpus for a given ambiguous word, Open Mind Word Expert includes an active learning component that has the role of selecting for annotation only those examples that are the most informative.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"According to (Dagan et al., 1995), there are two main types of active learning.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"The first one uses memberships queries, in which the learner constructs examples and asks a user to label them.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"In natural language processing tasks, this approach is not always applicable, since it is hard and not always possible to construct meaningful unlabeled examples for training.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Instead, a second type of active learning can be applied to these tasks, which is selective sampling.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"In this case, several classifiers examine the unlabeled data and identify only those examples that are the most informative, that is the examples where a certain level of disagreement is measured among the classifiers.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"We use a simplified form of active learning with selective sampling, where the instances to be tagged are selected as those instances where there is a disagreement between the labels assigned by two different classifiers.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"The two classifiers are trained on a relatively small corpus of tagged data, which is formed either with (1) Senseval training examples, in the case of Senseval words, or (2) examples obtained with the Open Mind Word Expert system itself, when no other training data is available.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The first classifier is a Semantic Tagger with Active Feature Selection (STAFS).,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
This system (previously known as SMUls) is one of the top ranked systems in the English lexical sample task at SENSEVAL-2.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The system consists of an instance based learning algorithm improved with a scheme for automatic feature selection.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
It relies on the fact that different sets of features have different effects depending on the ambiguous word considered.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Rather than creating a general learning model for all polysemous words, STAFS builds a separate feature space for each individual word.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"The features are selected from a pool of eighteen different features that have been previously acknowledged as good indicators of word sense, including: part of speech of the ambiguous word itself, surrounding words and their parts of speech, keywords in context, noun before and after, verb before and after, and others.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
An iterative forward search algorithm identifies at each step the feature that leads to the highest cross-validation precision computed on the training data.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"More details on this system can be found in (Mihalcea, 2002b).","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The second classifier is a COnstraint-BAsed Language Tagger (COBALT).,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The system treats every training example as a set of soft constraints on the sense of the word of interest.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"WordNet glosses, hyponyms, hyponym glosses and other WordNet data is also used to create soft constraints.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Currently, only “keywords in context” type of constraint is implemented, with weights accounting for the distance from the target word.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The tagging is performed by finding the sense that minimizes the violation of constraints in the instance being tagged.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
COBALT generates confidences in its tagging of a given instance based on how much the constraints were satisfied and violated for that instance.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
Both taggers use WordNet 1.7 dictionary glosses and relations.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The performance of the two systems and their level of agreement were evaluated on the Senseval noun data set.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The two systems agreed in their classification decision in 54.96% of the cases.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"This low agreement level is a good indication that the two approaches are fairly orthogonal, and therefore we may hope for high disambiguation precision on the agreement set.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Indeed, the tagging accuracy measured on the set where both COBALT and STAFS assign the same label is 82.5%, a figure that is close to the 85.5% inter-annotator agreement measured for the SENSEVAL-2 nouns (Kilgarriff, 2002).","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
Table 1 lists the precision for the agreement and disagreement sets of the two taggers.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The low precision on the instances in the disagreement set justifies referring to these as “hard to tag”.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"In Open Mind Word Expert, these are the instances that are presented to the users for tagging in the active learning stage.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
Collecting from the general public holds the promise of providing much data at low cost.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"It also makes attending to two aspects of data collection more important: (1) ensuring contribution quality, and (2) making the contribution process engaging to the contributors.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
We have several steps already implemented and have additional steps we propose to ensure quality.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"First, redundant tagging is collected for each item.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
Open Mind Word Expert currently uses the following rules in presenting items to volunteer contributors: Two tags per item.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Once an item has two tags associated with it, it is not presented for further tagging.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
One tag per item per contributor.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
We allow contributors to submit tagging either anonymously or having logged in.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
Anonymous contributors are not shown any items already tagged by contributors (anonymous or not) from the same IP address.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
Logged in contributors are not shown items they have already tagged.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, inaccurate sessions will be discarded.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"This can be accomplished in two ways, roughly by checking agreement and precision: Using redundancy of tags collected for each item, any given session (a tagging done all in one sitting) will be checked for agreement with tagging of the same items collected outside of this session.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"If necessary, the precision of a given contributor with respect to a preexisting gold standard (such as SemCor or Senseval training data) can be estimated directly by presenting the contributor with examples from the gold standard.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"This will be implemented if there are indications of need for this in the pilot; it will help screen out contributors who, for example, always select the first sense (and are in high agreement with other contributors who do the same).","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"In all, automatic assessment of the quality of tagging seems possible, and, based on the experience of prior volunteer contribution projects (Singh, 2002), the rate of maliciously misleading or incorrect contributions is surprisingly low.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Additionally, the tagging quality will be estimated by comparing the agreement level among Web contributors with the agreement level that was already measured in previous sense tagging projects.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"An analysis of the semantic annotation task performed by novice taggers as part of the SemCor project (Fellbaum et al., 1997) revealed an agreement of about 82.5% among novice taggers, and 75.2% among novice taggers and lexicographers.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Moreover, since we plan to use paid, trained taggers to create a separate test corpus for each of the words tagged with Open Mind Word Expert, these same paid taggers could also validate a small percentage of the training data for which no gold standard exists.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
We believe that making the contribution process as engaging and as “game-like” for the contributors as possible is crucial to collecting a large volume of data.,"{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"With that goal, Open Mind Word Expert tracks, for each contributor, the number of items tagged for each topic.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"When tagging items, a contributor is shown the number of items (for this word) she has tagged and the record number of items tagged (for this word) by a single user.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"If the contributor sets a record, it is recognized with a congratulatory message on the contribution screen, and the user is placed in the Hall of Fame for the site.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, the user can always access a real-time graph summarizing, by topic, their contribution versus the current record for that topic.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Interestingly, it seems that relatively simple word games can enjoy tremendous user acceptance.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, WordZap (http://wordzap.com), a game that pits players against each other or against a computer to be the first to make seven words from several presented letters (with some additional rules), has been downloaded by well over a million users, and the reviewers describe the game as “addictive”.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"If sense tagging can enjoy a fraction of such popularity, very large tagged corpora will be generated.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Additionally, NLP instructors can use the site as an aid in teaching lexical semantics.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"An instructor can create an “activity code”, and then, for users who have opted in as participants of that activity (by entering the activity code when creating their profiles), access the amount tagged by each participant, and the percentage agreement of the tagging of each contributor who opted in for this activity.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Hence, instructors can assign Open Mind Word Expert tagging as part of a homework assignment or a test.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, assuming there is a test set of already tagged examples for a given ambiguous word, we may add the capability of showing the increase in disambiguation precision on the test set, as it results from the samples that a user is currently tagging.","{'title': '3 Open Mind Word Expert', 'number': '3'}"
The Open Mind Word Expert system will be used to build large sense tagged corpora for some of the most frequent ambiguous words in English.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
The tagging will be collected over the Web from volunteer contributors.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
We propose to organize a task in SENSEVAL-3 where systems will disambiguate words using the corpus created with this system.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"We will initially select a set of 100 nouns, and collect for each of them tagged samples (Edmonds, 2000), where is the number of senses of the noun.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"It is worth mentioning that, unlike previous SENSEVAL evaluations, where multi-word expressions were considered as possible senses for an constituent ambiguous word, we filter these expressions apriori with an automatic tool for collocation extraction.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"Therefore, the examples we collect refer only to single ambiguous words, and hence we expect a lower inter-tagger agreement rate and lower WSD tagging precision when only single words are used, since usually multi-word expressions are not ambiguous and they constitute some of the ”easy cases” when doing sense tagging.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"These initial set of tagged examples will then be used to train the two classifiers described in Section 3.2, and annotate an additional set of examples.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"From these, the users will be presented only with those examples where there is a disagreement between the labels assigned by the two classifiers.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"The final corpus for each ambiguous word will be created with (1) the original set of tagged examples, plus (2) the examples selected by the active learning component, sense tagged by users.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"Words will be selected based on their frequencies, as computed on SemCor.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"Once the tagging process of the initial set of 100 words is completed, additional nouns will be incrementally added to the Open Mind Word Expert interface.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"As we go along, words with other parts of speech will be considered as well.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"To enable comparison with Senseval-2, the set of words will also include the 29 nouns used in the Senseval-2 lexical sample tasks.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
This would allow us to assess how much the collected data helps on the Senseval-2 task.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"As shown in Section 3.3, redundant tags will be collected for each item, and overall quality will be assessed.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"Moreover, starting with the initial set of examples labeled for each word, we will create confusion matrices that will indicate the similarity between word senses, and help us create the sense mappings for the coarse grained evaluations.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"One of the next steps we plan to take is to replace the ”two tags per item” scheme with the ”tag until at least two tags agree” scheme proposed and used during the SENSEVAL-2 tagging (Kilgarriff, 2002).","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"Additionally, the set of meanings that constitute the possible choices for a certain ambiguous example will be enriched with groups of similar meanings, which will be determined either based on some apriori provided sense mappings (if any available) or based on the confusion matrices mentioned above.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
"For each word with sense tagged data created with Open Mind Word Expert, a test corpus will be built by trained human taggers, starting with examples extracted from the corpus mentioned in Section 3.1.","{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
This process will be set up independently of the Open Mind Word Expert Web interface.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
The test corpus will be released during SENSEVAL-3.,"{'title': '4 Proposed Task for SENSEVAL-3', 'number': '4'}"
Open Mind Word Expert pursues the potential of creating a large tagged corpus.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions and future work', 'number': '5'}"
WSD can also benefit in other ways from the Open Mind approach.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions and future work', 'number': '5'}"
"We are considering using a AutoASC/GenCor type of approach to generate sense tagged data with a bootstrapping algorithm (Mihalcea, 2002a).","{'title': '5 Conclusions and future work', 'number': '5'}"
"Web contributors can help this process by creating the initial set of seeds, and exercising control over the quality of the automatically generated seeds.","{'title': '5 Conclusions and future work', 'number': '5'}"
We would like to thank the Open Mind Word Expert contributors who are making all this work possible.,"{'title': 'Acknowledgments', 'number': '6'}"
