Arabic is garnering attention in the NLP community due to its socio-political importance and its linguistic differences from Indo-European languages.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"These linguistic characteristics, especially dialect differences and complex morphology present interesting challenges for NLP researchers.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"But like most non-European languages, Arabic is lacking in annotated resources and tools.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Fully automated fundamental NLP tools such as Tokenizers, Part Of Speech (POS) Taggers and Base Phrase (BP) Chunkers are still not available for Arabic.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Meanwhile, these tools are readily available and have achieved remarkable accuracy and sophistication for the processing of many European languages.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"With the release of the Arabic Penn TreeBank 1 (v2.0),1 the story is about to change.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we propose solutions to the problems of Tokenization, POS Tagging and BP Chunking of Arabic text.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"By Tokenization we mean the process of segmenting clitics from stems, since in Arabic, prepositions, conjunctions, and some pronouns are cliticized (orthographically and phonological fused) onto stems.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Separating conjunctions from the following noun, for example, is a key first step in parsing.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"By POS Tagging, we mean the standard problem of annotating these segmented words with parts of speech drawn from the ‘collapsed’ Arabic Penn TreeBank POS tagset.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Base Phrase (BP) Chunking is the process of creating non-recursive base phrases such as noun phrases, adjectival phrases, verb phrases, preposition phrases, etc.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For each of these tasks, we adopt a supervised machine learning perspective using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained on the Arabic TreeBank, leveraging off of already existing algorithms for English.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The results are comparable to state-of-the-art results on English text when trained on similar sized data.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Arabic is a Semitic language with rich templatic morphology.,"{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
"An Arabic word may be composed of a stem (consisting of a consonantal root and a template), plus affixes and clitics.","{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
"The affixes include inflectional markers for tense, gender, and/or number.","{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
"The clitics include some (but not all) prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, possessive pronouns and pronouns.","{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
Some are proclitic ( attaching to the beginning of a stem) and some enclitics (attaching to the end of a stem).,"{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"

"In this paper, stems+affixes, proclitics, enclitics and punctuation are referred to as tokens.","{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
We define a token as a space delimited unit in clitic tokenized text.,"{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
"We adopt a supervised learning approach, hence the need for annotated training data.","{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
"Such data are available from the Arabic TreeBank,2 a modern standard Arabic corpus containing Agence France Presse (AFP) newswire articles ranging over a period of 5 months from July through November of 2000.","{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
"The corpus comprises 734 news articles (140k words corresponding to 168k tokens after semi-automatic segmentation) covering various topics such as sports, politics, news, etc.","{'title': '2 Arabic Language and Data', 'number': '2'}"
"To our knowledge, there are no systems that automatically tokenize and POS Arabic text as such.","{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
"The current standard approach to Arabic tokenization and POS tagging —adopted in the Arabic TreeBank —relies on manually choosing the appropriate analysis from among the multiple analyses rendered by AraMorph, a sophisticated rule based morphological analyzer by Buckwalter.3 Morphological analysis may be characterized as the process of segmenting a surface word form into its component derivational and inflectional morphemes.","{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
"In a language such as Arabic, which exhibits both inflectional and derivational morphology, the morphological tags tend to be fine grained amounting to a large number of tags — AraMorph has 135 distinct morphological labels — in contrast to POS tags which are typically coarser grained.","{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
"Using AraMorph, the choice of an appropriate morphological analysis entails clitic tokenization as well assignment of a POS tag.","{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
"Such morphological labels are potentially useful for NLP applications, yet the necessary manual choice renders it an expensive process.","{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
"On the other hand, Khoja (Khoja, 2001) reports preliminary results on a hybrid, statistical and rule based, POS tagger, APT.","{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
APT yields 90% accuracy on a tag set of 131 tags including both POS and inflection morphology information.,"{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
APT is a two-step hybrid system with rules and a Viterbi algorithm for statistically determining the appropriate POS tag.,"{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
"Given the tag set, APT is more of a morphological analyzer than a POS tagger.","{'title': '3 Related Work', 'number': '3'}"
"In the literature, various machine learning approaches are applied to the problem of POS tagging and BP Chunking.","{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Such problems are cast as a classification problem where, given a number of features extracted from a predefined linguistic context, the task is to predict the class of a token.","{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) are one class of such model.","{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
SVMs are a supervised learning algorithm that has the advantage of being robust where it can handle a large number of (overlapping) features with good generalization performance.,"{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Consequently, SVMs have been applied in many NLP tasks with great success (Joachims, 1998; Kudo and Matsumato, 2000; Hacioglu and Ward, 2003).","{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
We adopt a tagging perspective for the three tasks.,"{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"Thereby, we address them using the same SVM experimental setup which comprises a standard SVM as a multiclass classifier (Allwein et al., 2000).","{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
"The difference for the three tasks lies in the input, context and features.","{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"

Tag Set: The utilized tag set comprises the 24 collapsed tags available in the Arabic TreeBank distribution.,"{'title': '4 SVM Based Approach', 'number': '4'}"
