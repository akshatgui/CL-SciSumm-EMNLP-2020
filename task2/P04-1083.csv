"In an ordinary syntactic parser, the input is a string, and the grammar ranges over strings.",{}
This paper explores generalizations of ordinary parsing algorithms that allow the input to consist of string tuples and/or the grammar to range over string tuples.,{}
Such algorithms can infer the synchronous structures hidden in parallel texts.,{}
It turns out that these generalized parsers can do most of the work required to train and apply a syntax-aware statistical machine translation system.,{}

"Nevertheless, it is satisfying to note that all the non-trivial algorithms in Figure 7 are special cases of Translator CT.","{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
"It is therefore possible to implement an MTSMT system using just one inference algorithm, parameterized by a grammar, a semiring, and a search strategy.","{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
An advantage of building an MT system in this manner is that improvements invented for ordinary parsing algorithms can often be applied to all the main components of the system.,"{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, Melamed (2003) showed how to reduce the computational complexity of a synchronous parser by , just by changing the logic.","{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
The same optimization can be applied to the inference algorithms in this paper.,"{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
"With proper software design, such optimizations need never be implemented more than once.","{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
"For simplicity, the algorithms in this paper are based on CKY logic.","{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
"However, the architecture in Figure 7 can also be implemented using generalizations of more sophisticated parsing logics, such as those inherent in Earley or Head-Driven parsers.","{'title': '6 Multitree-based Statistical MT', 'number': '6'}"
This paper has presented generalizations of ordinary parsing that emerge when the grammar and/or the input can be multidimensional.,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"Along the way, it has elucidated the relationships between ordinary parsers and other classes of algorithms, some previously known and some not.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"It turns out that, given some multitext and a monolingual treebank, a rudimentary multitree-based statistical machine translation system can be built and applied using only generalized parsers and some trivial glue.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
There are three research benefits of using generalized parsers to build MT systems.,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"First, we can take advantage of past and future research on making parsers more accurate and more efficient.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"Therefore, second, we can concentrate our efforts on better models, without worrying about MT-specific search algorithms.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"Third, more generally and most importantly, this approach encourages MT research to be less specialized and more transparently related to the rest of computational linguistics.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
