Statistical machine translation systems are usually trained on large amounts of bilingual text and monolingual text in the target language.,{}
In this paper we explore the use of transductive semi-supervised methods for the effective use of monolingual data from the source language in order to improve translation quality.,{}
"We propose several algorithms with this aim, and present the strengths and weaknesses of each one.",{}
We present detailed experimental evaluations on the French–English EuroParl data set and on data from the NIST Chinese–English largedata track.,{}
We show a significant improvement in translation quality on both tasks.,{}
"In statistical machine translation (SMT), translation is modeled as a decision process.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The goal is to find the translation t of source sentence s which maximizes the posterior probability: arg max p(t  |s) = arg max p(s  |t) · p(t) (1) This decomposition of the probability yields two different statistical models which can be trained independently of each other: the translation model p(s  |t) and the target language model p(t).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Even if large amounts of bilingual text are given, the training of the statistical models usually suffers from sparse data.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The number of possible events, i.e. phrase pairs or pairs of subtrees in the two languages, is too big to reliably estimate a probability distribution over such pairs.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Another problem is that for many language pairs the amount of available bilingual text is very limited.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"To tackle this problem, we propose algorithms for transductive semi-supervised learning.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"By transductive, we mean that we repeatedly translate sentences from the development set or test set and use the generated translations to improve the performance of the SMT system.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Note that the evaluation step is still done just once at the end of our learning process.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we show that such an approach can lead to better translations despite the fact that the development and test data are typically much smaller in size than typical training data for SMT systems.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Transductive learning can be seen as a means to adapt the SMT system to a new type of text.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"In Algorithm 1, the Score function assigns a score to each translation hypothesis t. We used the following scoring functions in our experiments: which we implemented follows the approaches suggested in (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing and Ney, 2007): The confidence score of a target sentence t is calculated as a log-linear combination of phrase posterior probabilities, Levenshtein-based word posterior probabilities, and a target language model score.","{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
The weights of the different scores are optimized w.r.t. classification error rate (CER).,"{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"

The table provides a quick guide to the experiments we present in this paper vs. those we did not attempt due to computational infeasibility.,"{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
We ran experiments corresponding to all entries marked with ∗ (see Section 4.2).,"{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
For those marked ∗∗ the experiments produced only minimal improvement over the baseline and so we do not discuss them in this paper.,"{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
The entries marked as † were not attempted because they are not feasible (e.g. full re-training on the NIST data).,"{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
"However, these were run on the smaller EuroParl corpus.","{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
"We evaluated the generated translations using three different evaluation metrics: BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), mWER (multi-reference word error rate), and mPER (multi-reference positionindependent word error rate) (Nießen et al., 2000).","{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
"Note that BLEU score measures quality, whereas mWER and mPER measure translation errors.","{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
We will present 95%-confidence intervals for the baseline system which are calculated using bootstrap resampling.,"{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"

This results in much lower BLEU scores and higher error rates for the translations of the GALE set (see Section 4.2).,"{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
"Note that these values do not indicate lower translation quality, but are simply a result of using only one reference.","{'title': '2 Baseline MT System', 'number': '2'}"
We ran our initial experiments on EuroParl to explore the behavior of the transductive learning algorithm.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"In all experiments reported in this subsection, the test set was used as unlabeled data.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
The selection and scoring was carried out using importance sampling with normalized scores.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"In one set of experiments, we used the 100K and 150K training sentences filtered according to n-gram coverage over the test set.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"We fully re-trained the phrase tables on these data and 8,000 test sentence pairs sampled from 20-best lists in each iteration.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
The results on the test set can be seen in Figure 1.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"The BLEU score increases, although with slight variation, over the iterations.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"In total, it increases from 24.1 to 24.4 for the 100K filtered corpus, and from 24.5 to 24.8 for 150K, respectively.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"Moreover, we see that the BLEU score of the system using 100K training sentence pairs and transductive learning is the same as that of the one trained on 150K sentence pairs.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
So the information extracted from untranslated test sentences is equivalent to having an additional 50K sentence pairs.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"In a second set of experiments, we used the whole EuroParl corpus and the sampled sentences for fully re-training the phrase tables in each iteration.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
We ran the algorithm for three iterations and the BLEU score increased from 25.3 to 25.6.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"Even though this is a small increase, it shows that the unlabeled data contains some information which can be explored in transductive learning.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"In a third experiment, we applied the mixture model idea as explained in Section 3.2.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
The initially learned phrase table was merged with the learned phrase table in each iteration with a weight of A = 0.1.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"

We ran the algorithm for 20 iterations and BLEU score increased from 25.3 to 25.7.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
"Since this is very similar to the result obtained with the previous method, but with an additional parameter A to optimize, we did not use mixture models on NIST.","{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"
Note that the single improvements achieved here are slightly below the 95%-significance level.,"{'title': '4.2 Results EuroParl', 'number': '3'}"

"For this corpus U, 5,000-best lists were generated using the baseline SMT system.","{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"
"Since re-training the full phrase tables is not feasible here, a (small) additional phrase table, specific to U, was trained and plugged into the SMT system as an additional model.","{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"
The decoder weights thus had to be optimized again to determine the appropriate weight for this new phrase table.,"{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"
"This was done on the dev1 corpus, using the phrase table specific to dev1.","{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"

"In the first experiment presented in Table 4, all of the generated 1-best translations were kept and used for training the adapted phrase tables.","{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"
This method yields slightly higher translation quality than the baseline system.,"{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"

"As the results in Table 4 show, both variants outperform the first method, with a consistent improvement over the baseline across all test corpora and evaluation metrics.","{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"

"The error rates are significantly reduced in all three settings, and BLEU score increases in all cases.","{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"
"A comparison with Table 4 shows that transductive learning on the development set and test corpora, adapting the system to their domain and style, is more effective in improving the SMT system than the use of additional source language data.","{'title': 'NIST', 'number': '4'}"

It is not intuitively clear why the SMT system can learn something from its own output and is improved through semi-supervised learning.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"There are two main reasons for this improvement: Firstly, the selection step provides important feedback for the system.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"The confidence estimation, for example, discards translations with low language model scores or posterior probabilities.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
The selection step discards bad machine translations and reinforces phrases of high quality.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"As a result, the probabilities of lowquality phrase pairs, such as noise in the table or overly confident singletons, degrade.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
Our experiments comparing the various settings for transductive learning shows that selection clearly outperforms the method which keeps all generated translations as additional training data.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
The selection methods investigated here have been shown to be wellsuited to boost the performance of semi-supervised learning for SMT.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
"Secondly, our algorithm constitutes a way of adapting the SMT system to a new domain or style without requiring bilingual training or development data.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
Those phrases in the existing phrase tables which are relevant for translating the new data are reinforced.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '6'}"
