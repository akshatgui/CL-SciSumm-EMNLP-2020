"Then we re-generate the queue Q with P and the updated weight vector w. Specifically, we first remove all the elements in Q, and then generate hypotheses for all the possible spans based on the context spans in P. Hypothesis scores and action scores are calculated with the updated weight vector w. A special aspect of Algorithm 2 is that we maintain two scores: the score of the action represents the confidence for the next move, and the score of the hypothesis represents the overall quality of a partial result.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"The selection for the next action directly depends on the score of the action, but not on the score of the hypothesis.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"On the other hand, the score of the hypothesis is used to maintain top partial results for each span.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
We briefly describe the soundness of the Guided Learning Algorithm in terms of two aspects.,"{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"First, in Algorithm 2 weight update is activated whenever there exists an incorrect state s, the action score of whose top hypothesis s.T is higher than that of any state in each span.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
We demote this action and promote the gold standard action on the same span.,"{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"764 Require: training sequence pairs {(Xr,Yr)11<r<R; Require: beam width B and iterations I; However, we do not automatically adopt the gold standard action on this span.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"Instead, in the next step, the top hypothesis of another span might be selected based on the score of action, which means that it becomes the most favorable action according to the updated weights.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"As a second aspect, if the action score of a gold standard hypothesis is higher than that of any others, this hypothesis and the corresponding span are guaranteed to be selected at line 8 of Algorithm 2.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
The reason for this is that the scores of the context hypotheses of a gold standard hypothesis must be no less than those of other hypotheses of the same span.,"{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"This could be shown recursively with respect to Equation 1, because the context hypotheses of a gold standard hypothesis are also compatible with the gold standard.","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"
"Furthermore, if we take (xi = f(p'.G.A) − f(p'.S.T.A), yi = +1) as a positive sample, and (xj = f(p'.S.T.A) − f(p'.G.A), yj = −1) as a negative sample, the weight updates at lines 13 and 14 are a stochastic approximation of gradient descent that minimizes the squared errors of the misclassified samples (Widrow and Hoff, 1960).","{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"

Guided learning is not as hard as reinforcement learning.,"{'title': 'VBD---DT---NN JJ VBD---IN---NN JJ', 'number': '3'}"

"In addition, our treatment of the score of action and the score of hypothesis is unique (see discussion in Section 2.3).","{'title': '3 Related Works', 'number': '4'}"
"Furthermore, compared to the above works, our guided learning algorithm is more aggressive on learning.","{'title': '3 Related Works', 'number': '4'}"
"In (Collins and Roark, 2004; Shen and Joshi, 2005), a search stops if there is no hypothesis compatible with the gold standard in the queue of candidates.","{'title': '3 Related Works', 'number': '4'}"
"In (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005), the search is resumed after some gold standard compatible hypotheses are inserted into a queue for future expansion, and the weights are updated correspondingly.","{'title': '3 Related Works', 'number': '4'}"

"In our algorithm, the gold standard compatible hypotheses are used for weight update only.","{'title': '3 Related Works', 'number': '4'}"
"As a result, after each sentence is processed, the weight vector can usually successfully predict the gold standard parse.","{'title': '3 Related Works', 'number': '4'}"

"We carry out experiments on the standard data set of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994).","{'title': '4 Experiments on POS Tagging', 'number': '5'}"
"Following (Ratnaparkhi,1996; Collins, 2002; Toutanova et al., 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005), we cut the PTB into the training, development and test sets as shown in Table 1.","{'title': '4 Experiments on POS Tagging', 'number': '5'}"
We use tools provided by CoNLL-2005 3 to extract POS tags from the mrg files of PTB.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on POS Tagging', 'number': '5'}"
So the data set is the same as previous work.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on POS Tagging', 'number': '5'}"
We use the development set to select features and estimate the number of iterations in training.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on POS Tagging', 'number': '5'}"
"In our experiments, we enumerate all the POS tags for each word instead of using a dictionary as in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), since the size of the tag set is tractable and our learning algorithm is efficient enough.","{'title': '4 Experiments on POS Tagging', 'number': '5'}"
Effect of Features: We first run the experiments to evaluate the effect of features.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
We use templates to define features.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"For this set of experiments, we set the beam width B = 3 as a balance between speed and accuracy.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
The guided learning algorithm usually converges on the development data set in 4-8 iterations over the training data.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
Table 2 shows the error rate on the development set with different features.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"We first use the same feature set used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), which includes a set of prefix, suffix and lexical features, as well as some bi-gram and tri-gram context features.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"Following (Collins, 2002), we do not distinguish rare words.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"On set A, Ratnaparkhi’s feature set, our system reports an error rate of 3.05% on the development data set.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"With set B, we include a few feature templates which are symmetric to those in Ratnaparkhi’s set, but are only available with bidirectional search.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"With set C, we add more bi-gram and tri-gram features.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"With set D, we include bi-lexical features.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"With set E, we use prefixes and suffixes of length up to 9, as in (Toutanova et al., 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
We obtain 2.72% of error rate.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
We will use this feature set on our final experiments on the test data.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"Effect of Search and Learning Strategies: For the second set of experiments, we evaluate the effect of search methods, learning strategies, and beam width.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"

Table 3 shows the error rates on the development data set with both left-to-right (L-to-R) and bidirectional (Bi-Dir) search methods.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
We also tested both aggressive learning and non-aggressive learning strategies with beam width of 1 and 3.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"First, with non-aggressive learning on bidirectional search, the error rate does not converge to a comparable number.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"This is due to the fact that the search space is too large in bidirectional search, if we do not use aggressive learning to constrain the samples for learning.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"With aggressive learning, the bidirectional approach always shows advantages over left-to-right search.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"However, the gap is not large.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
This is due to the fact that the accuracy of POS tagging is very high.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"As a result, we can always keep the gold-standard tags in the beam even with left-to-right search in training.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
This can also explain why the performance of leftto-right search with non-aggressive learning is close to bidirectional search if the beam is large enough.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"However, with beam width = 1, non-aggressive learning over left-to-right search performs much worse, because in this case it is more likely that the gold-standard tag is not in the beam.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
This set of experiments show that guided learning is more preferable for tasks with higher ambiguities.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"In our recent work (Shen and Joshi, 2007), we have applied a variant of this algorithm to dependency parsing, and showed significant improvement over left-to-right non-aggressive learning strategy.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
Comparison: Table 4 shows the comparison with the previous works on the PTB test sections.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"

We obtain an error rate of 2.67% on the test data.,"{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"With deterministic search, or beam with B = 1, we obtain an error rate of 2.73%.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"Compared to previous best result on the same data set, 2.76% by (Toutanova et al., 2003), our best result shows a relative error reduction of 3.3%.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"This result is very promising, since we have not used any specially designed features in our experiments.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"
"It is reported in (Toutanova et al., 2003) that a crude company name detector was used to generate features, and it gave rise to significant improvement in performance.","{'title': '4.2 Results', 'number': '6'}"

We apply this novel algorithm to POS tagging.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '7'}"
"It obtains an error rate of 2.67% on the standard PTB test set, which represents 3.3% relative error reduction over the previous best result (Toutanova et al., 2003) on the same data set, while using fewer features.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '7'}"
"By using deterministic search, it obtains an error rate of 2.73%, a 5.9% relative error reduction over the previous best deterministic algorithm (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005).","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '7'}"
"It should be noted that the error rate is close to the inter-annotator discrepancy on PTB, the standard test set for POS tagging, therefore it is very difficult to achieve improvement.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '7'}"
