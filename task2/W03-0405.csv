"This paper presents a set of algorithms for distinguishing personal names with multiple real referents in text, based on little or no supervision.",{}
"The approach utilizes an unsupervised clustering technique over a rich feature space of biographic facts, which are automatically extracted via a language-independent bootstrapping process.",{}
The induced clustering of named entities are then partitioned and linked to their real referents via the automatically extracted biographic data.,{}
Performance is evaluated based on both a test set of handlabeled multi-referent personal names and via automatically generated pseudonames.,{}
One open problem in natural language ambiguity resolution is the task of proper noun disambiguation'.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"While word senses and translation ambiguities may typically have 2-20 alternative meanings that must be resolved through context, a personal name such as “Jim Clark” may potentially refer to hundreds or thousands of distinct individuals.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"However, in the specialized case of personal names, there is more precise information available.","{'title': '2 Robust Extraction of Categorical Biographic Data', 'number': '2'}"
"In particular, information extraction techniques can add high precision, categorical information such as approximate age/date-of-birth, nationality and occupation.","{'title': '2 Robust Extraction of Categorical Biographic Data', 'number': '2'}"
This categorical data can support or exclude a candidate nameHreferent matches with higher confidence and greater pinpoint accuracy than via simple context vector-style features alone.,"{'title': '2 Robust Extraction of Categorical Biographic Data', 'number': '2'}"
Another major source of disambiguation information for proper nouns is the space of associated names.,"{'title': '2 Robust Extraction of Categorical Biographic Data', 'number': '2'}"
"While these names could be used in a undifferentiated vector-based bag-of-words model, further accuracy can be gained by extracting specific types of association, such as familial relationships (e.g. son, wife), employment relationships (e.g. manager of), and nationality as distinct from simple term co-occurrence in a window.","{'title': '2 Robust Extraction of Categorical Biographic Data', 'number': '2'}"

This section examines clustering of web pages which containing an ambiguous personal name (with multiple real referents).,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
The cluster method we employed is bottom-up centroid agglomerative clustering.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
"In this method, each document is assigned a vector of automatically extracted features.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
"At each stage of the clustering, the two most similar vectors are merged, to produce a new cluster, with a vector equal to the centroid of the vectors in the cluster.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
This step is repeated until all documents are clustered.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"

"To assess similarity between vectors we utilized standard cosine similarity (cos(a, b) = a·b ||a||×||b||).","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
We experimentally determined that the use of proper nouns alone led to more pure clustering.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
"As a result, for the remainder of the experiments, we used only proper nouns in the vectors, except for those common words introduced by the various feature sets.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
Selective term weighting has been shown to be highly effective for information retrieval.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
"For this study, we investigated both the use of standard TFIDF weighting and weighting based on the mutual information, where given a document collection c, From these, we select words which appear more than A1 = 20 times in the collection, and have a I(w; c) greater than A2 = 10.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"

"If a document connects a name with a birth year, and another document connects the same name with the same birth year, typically, those two documents refer to the same person.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
These extracted features were used to categorically cluster documents in which they appeared.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"

"In addition to improving disambiguation performance, these extracted features help distinguish the different clusters, and provide information about the different people.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
Another method for using these extracted features is to give higher weight to words which have ever been seen as filling a pattern.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, if 1756 is extracted as a birth year from a syntactic-based pattern for the polysemous name, then whenever 1756 is observed anywhere in context (outside an extraction pattern), it is given a higher weighting and added to the document vector as a potential biographic feature.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
"In our experiments, we did this only for words which appeared as values for a feature more than a threshold of 4 times.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
"Then, whenever the word was seen in a document, it was given a weight equal to the log of the number of times the word was seen as an extracted feature.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"

"With this type of agglomerative clustering, the most similar pages are clustered first, and outliers are assigned as stragglers at the top levels of the cluster tree.","{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
This typically leads to a full clustering where the top-level clusters are significantly less discriminative than those at the roots.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"

An alternative to this form of cluster refactoring would be to initially cluster only pages with extracted features.,"{'title': '3 Using Unsupervised Clustering to Identify the Referents of Personal Names', 'number': '3'}"
