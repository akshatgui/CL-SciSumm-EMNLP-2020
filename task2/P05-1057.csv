"Word alignment, which can be defined as an object for indicating the corresponding words in a parallel text, was first introduced as an intermediate result of statistical translation models (Brown et al., 1993).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In statistical machine translation, word alignment plays a crucial role as word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source of translation-related knowledge.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Various methods have been proposed for finding word alignments between parallel texts.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
There are generally two categories of alignment approaches: statistical approaches and heuristic approaches.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Statistical approaches, which depend on a set of unknown parameters that are learned from training data, try to describe the relationship between a bilingual sentence pair (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel and Ney, 1996).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Heuristic approaches obtain word alignments by using various similarity functions between the types of the two languages (Smadja et al., 1996; Ker and Chang, 1997; Melamed, 2000).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The central distinction between statistical and heuristic approaches is that statistical approaches are based on well-founded probabilistic models while heuristic ones are not.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Studies reveal that statistical alignment models outperform the simple Dice coefficient (Och and Ney, 2003).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Finding word alignments between parallel texts, however, is still far from a trivial work due to the diversity of natural languages.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, the alignment of words within idiomatic expressions, free translations, and missing content or function words is problematic.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"When two languages widely differ in word order, finding word alignments is especially hard.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate all useful linguistic information to alleviate these problems.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Tiedemann (2003) introduced a word alignment approach based on combination of association clues.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Clues combination is done by disjunction of single clues, which are defined as probabilities of associations.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The crucial assumption of clue combination that clues are independent of each other, however, is not always true.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Och and Ney (2003) proposed Model 6, a log-linear combination of IBM translation models and HMM model.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Although Model 6 yields better results than naive IBM models, it fails to include dependencies other than IBM models and HMM model.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Cherry and Lin (2003) developed a statistical model to find word alignments, which allow easy integration of context-specific features.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Log-linear models, which are very suitable to incorporate additional dependencies, have been successfully applied to statistical machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

Our experiments show that log-linear models significantly outperform IBM translation models.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We begin by describing log-linear models for word alignment.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The design of feature functions is discussed then.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Next, we present the training method and the search algorithm for log-linear models.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We will follow with our experimental results and conclusion and close with a discussion of possible future directions.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Formally, we use following definition for alignment.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"Given a source (’English’) sentence e = eI1 = e1, ... , ei, ..., eI and a target language (’French’) sentence f = fJ1 = f1, ..., fj, ..., fJ.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"We define a link l = (i, j) to exist if ei and fj are translation (or part of a translation) of one another.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"We define the null link l = (i, 0) to exist if ei does not correspond to a translation for any French word in f. The null link l = (0, j) is defined similarly.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"An alignment a is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of the word positions: We define the alignment problem as finding the alignment a that maximizes Pr(a  |e, f) given e and f. We directly model the probability Pr(a  |e, f).","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"An especially well-founded framework is maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996).","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"In this framework, we have a set of M feature functions hm(a, e, f), m = 1, ... , M. For each feature function, there exists a model parameter Am, m = 1, ... , M. The direct (2) This approach has been suggested by (Papineni et al., 1997) for a natural language understanding task and successfully applied to statistical machine translation by (Och and Ney, 2002).","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"We obtain the following decision rule: Typically, the source language sentence e and the target sentence f are the fundamental knowledge sources for the task of finding word alignments.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"Linguistic data, which can be used to identify associations between lexical items are often ignored by traditional word alignment approaches.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"Linguistic tools such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, namedentity recognizers have become more and more robust and available for many languages by now.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
It is important to make use of linguistic information to improve alignment strategies.,"{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"Treated as feature functions, syntactic dependencies can be easily incorporated into log-linear models.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to incorporate a new dependency which contains extra information other than the bilingual sentence pair, we modify Eq.2 by adding a new variable v: Note that our log-linear models are different from Model 6 proposed by Och and Ney (2003), which defines the alignment problem as finding the alignment a that maximizes Pr(f, a  |e) given e.","{'title': '2 Log-linear Models', 'number': '2'}"
"In this paper, we use IBM translation Model 3 as the base feature of our log-linear models.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"In addition, we also make use of syntactic information such as part-of-speech tags and bilingual dictionaries.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
Brown et al. (1993) proposed a series of statistical models of the translation process.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"IBM translation models try to model the translation probability Pr(fJ1 |eI 1), which describes the relationship between a source language sentence eI1 and a target language sentence fJ1 .","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"In statistical alignment models Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1), a ’hidden’ alignment a = aJ1 is introduced, which describes a mapping from a target position j to a source position i = aj.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"The relationship between the translation model and the alignment model is given by: Although IBM models are considered more coherent than heuristic models, they have two drawbacks.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"First, IBM models are restricted in a way such that each target word fj is assigned to exactly one source word eaj.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
A more general way is to model alignment as an arbitrary relation between source and target language positions.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, IBM models are typically language-independent and may fail to tackle problems occurred due to specific languages.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"In this paper, we use Model 3 as our base feature function, which is given by 1: We distinguish between two translation directions to use Model 3 as feature functions: treating English as source language and French as target language or vice versa.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
The first linguistic information we adopt other than the source language sentence e and the target language sentence f is part-of-speech tags.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"The use of POS information for improving statistical alignment quality of the HMM-based model is described 1If there is a target word which is assigned to more than one source words, h(a, e, f) = 0. in (Toutanova et al., 2002).","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
They introduce additional lexicon probability for POS tags in both languages.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"In IBM models as well as HMM models, when one needs the model to take new information into account, one must create an extended model which can base its parameters on the previous model.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"In log-linear models, however, new information can be easily incorporated.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
We use a POS Tags Transition Model as a feature function.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
This feature learns POS Tags transition probabilities from held-out data (via simple counting) and then applies the learned distributions to the ranking of various word alignments.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"We define eT = eT1I = eT1, ... , eTi, ... , eTI and fT = fT1J = fT1, ... , fTj, ... , fTJ as POS tag sequences of the sentence pair e and f. POS Tags Transition Model is formally described as: where a is an element of a, a(i) is the corresponding source position of a and a(j) is the target position.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"Hence, the feature function is: We still distinguish between two translation directions to use POS tags Transition Model as feature functions: treating English as source language and French as target language or vice versa.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
A conventional bilingual dictionary can be considered an additional knowledge source.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
We could use a feature that counts how many entries of a conventional lexicon co-occur in a given alignment between the source sentence and the target sentence.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, the weight for the provided conventional dictionary can be learned.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
The intuition is that the conventional dictionary is expected to be more reliable than the automatically trained lexicon and therefore should get a larger weight.,"{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"We define a bilingual dictionary as a set of entries: D = {(e, f, conf)}. e is a source language word, f is a target langauge word, and conf is a positive real-valued number (usually, conf = 1.0) assigned by lexicographers to evaluate the validity of the entry.","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, the feature function using a bilingual dictionary is: where","{'title': '3 Feature Functions', 'number': '3'}"
"We use the GIS (Generalized Iterative Scaling) algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) to train the model parameters λM1 of the log-linear models according to Eq.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
4.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"By applying suitable transformations, the GIS algorithm is able to handle any type of real-valued features.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"In practice, We use YASMET 2 written by Franz J. Och for performing training.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
The renormalization needed in Eq.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
4 requires a sum over a large number of possible alignments.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"If e has length l and f has length m, there are possible 2lm alignments between e and f (Brown et al., 1993).","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
It is unrealistic to enumerate all possible alignments when lm is very large.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"Hence, we approximate this sum by sampling the space of all possible alignments by a large set of highly probable alignments.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
The set of considered alignments are also called n-best list of alignments.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"We train model parameters on a development corpus, which consists of hundreds of manually-aligned bilingual sentence pairs.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
Using an n-best approximation may result in the problem that the parameters trained with the GIS algorithm yield worse alignments even on the development corpus.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
This can happen because with the modified model scaling factors the n-best list can change significantly and can include alignments that have not been taken into account in training.,"{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"To avoid this problem, we iteratively combine n-best lists to train model parameters until the resulting n-best list does not change, as suggested by Och (2002).","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"However, as this training procedure is based on maximum likelihood criterion, there is only a loose relation to the final alignment quality on unseen bilingual texts.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"In practice, having a series of model parameters when the iteration ends, we select the model parameters that yield best alignments on the development corpus.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
"After the bilingual sentences in the development corpus are tokenized (or segmented) and POS tagged, they can be used to train POS tags transition probabilities by counting relative frequencies: N(eHere, NA(fT, eT) is the frequency that the POS tag fT is aligned to POS tag eT and N(eT) is the frequency of eT in the development corpus.","{'title': '4 Training', 'number': '4'}"
We use a greedy search algorithm to search the alignment with highest probability in the space of all possible alignments.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
A state in this space is a partial alignment.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
A transition is defined as the addition of a single link to the current state.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
"Our start state is the empty alignment, where all words in e and f are assigned to null.","{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
A terminal state is a state in which no more links can be added to increase the probability of the current alignment.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
Our task is to find the terminal state with the highest probability.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
"We can compute gain, which is a heuristic function, instead of probability for efficiency.","{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
"A gain is defined as follows: exp[EMm= 1 λmhm(a, e, f)] where l = (i, j) is a link added to a.","{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
"The greedy search algorithm for general loglinear models is formally described as follows: Input: e, f, eT, fT, and D Output: a The above search algorithm, however, is not efficient for our log-linear models.","{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
"It is time-consuming for each feature to figure out a probability when adding a new link, especially when the sentences are very long.","{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
"For our models, gain(a, l) can be obtained in a more efficient way 3: 3We still call the new heuristic function gain to reduce notational overhead, although the gain in Eq.","{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
13 is not equivalent to the one in Eq.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
12.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"
The gain threshold t depends on the added link l. We remove this dependency for simplicity when using it in search algorithm by treating it as a fixed real-valued number.,"{'title': '5 Search', 'number': '5'}"

"Provided with human-annotated word-level alignment, we use precision, recall and AER (Och and Ney, 2003) for scoring the viterbi alignments of each model against gold-standard annotated alignments: where A is the set of word pairs aligned by word alignment systems, S is the set marked in the gold standard as ”sure” and P is the set marked as ”possible” (including the ”sure” pairs).","{'title': '6 Experimental Results', 'number': '6'}"
"In our ChineseEnglish corpus, only one type of alignment was marked, meaning that S = P. In the following, we present the results of loglinear models for word alignment.","{'title': '6 Experimental Results', 'number': '6'}"
"We used GIZA++ package (Och and Ney, 2003) to train IBM translation models.","{'title': '6 Experimental Results', 'number': '6'}"

"Comparing Table 3 with Table 2, we notice that our log-linear models yield slightly better alignments by employing parameters generated by the training scheme 15H5354555 rather than 15H535, which can be attributed to improvement of parameters after further Model 4 and Model 5 training.","{'title': '6 Experimental Results', 'number': '6'}"
"For log-linear models, POS information and an additional dictionary are used, which is not the case for GIZA++/IBM models.","{'title': '6 Experimental Results', 'number': '6'}"
