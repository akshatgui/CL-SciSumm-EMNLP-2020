We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts.,{}
Our report concerns three related topics: (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus; (2) experiments addressing applicability of Gale (1991) lengthbased statistical method to the task of alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and (3) an improved statistical method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.,{}
"Recently, a number of automatic techniques for aligning sentences in parallel bilingual corpora have been proposed (Kay & ROscheisen 1988; Catizone et al. 1989; Gale & Church 1991; Brown et at.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"1991; Chen 1993), and coarser approaches when sentences are difficult to identify have also been advanced (Church 1993; Dagan el at.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
1993).,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
Such corpora contain the same material that has been translated by human experts into two languages.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
The goal of alignment is to identify matching sentences between the languages.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
Alignment is the first stage in extracting structural information and statistical parameters from bilingual corpora.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"The problem is made more difficult because a sentence in one language may correspond to multiple sentences in the other; worse yet, sometimes several sentences' content is distributed across multiple translated sentences.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
Approaches to alignment fall into two main classes: lexical and statistical.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
Lexically-based techniques use extensive online bilingual lexicons to match sentences.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"In contrast, statistical techniques require almost no prior knowledge and are based solely on the lengths of sentences.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
The empirical results to date suggest that statistical methods yield performance superior to that of currently available lexical techniques.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"However, as far as we know, the literature on automatic alignment has been restricted to alphabetic Indo-European languages.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"This methodological flaw weakens the arguments in favor of either approach, since it is unclear to what extent a technique's superiority depends on the similarity between related languages.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
The work reported herein moves towards addressing this problem.',"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts, which was performed as part of the SILC machine translation project.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
Our report concerns three related topics.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"In the first of the following sections, we describe the objectives of the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, and our progress.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
The subsequent sections report experiments addressing the applicability of a suitably modified version of Gale & Church's (1991) length-based statistical method to the task of aligning English with Chinese.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"In the final section, we describe an improved statistical method that also permits domain-specific lexical cues to be incorporated probabilistically.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
The dearth of work on non-Indo-European languages can partly be attributed to a lack of the prequisite bilingual corpora.,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"As a step toward remedying this, we are in the process of constructing a suitable English-Chinese corpus.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"To be included, materials must contain primarily tight, literal sentence translations.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
This rules out most fiction and literary material.,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"We have been concentrating on the Hong Kong Hansard, which are the parliamentary proceedings of the Legislative Council (LegCo).","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"Analogously to the bilingual texts of the Canadian Hansard (Gale 8.6 Church 1991), LegCo transcripts are kept in full translation in both English and Cantonese.2 However, unlike the Canadian Hansard, the Hong Kong Hansard has not previously been available in machine-readable form.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
We have obtained and converted these materials by special arrangement.,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
The materials contain high-quality literal translation.,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"Statements in LegCo may be made using either English or Cantonese, and are transcribed in the original language.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"A translation to the other language is made later to yield complete parallel texts, with annotations specifying the source language used by each speaker.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
Most sentences are translated 1-for-1.,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"A small proportion are 1-for-2 or 2-for-2, and on rare occasion 1-for-3, 3-for-3, or other configurations.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"Samples of the English and Chinese texts can be seen in figures 3 and 4.3 Because of the obscure format of the original data, it has been necessary to employ a substantial amount of automatic conversion and reformatting.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
Sentences are identified automatically using heuristics that depend on punctuation and spacing.,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"Segmentation errors occur occasionally, due either to typographical errors in the original data, or to inadequacies of our automatic conversion heuristics.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
This simply results in incorrectly placed delimiters; it does not remove any text from the corpus.,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"Although the emphasis is on clean text so that markup is minimal, paragraphs and sentences are marked following TEI-conformant SGML (Sperberg-McQueen & Burnard 1992).","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"We use the term &quot;sentence&quot; in a generalized sense including lines in itemized lists, headings, and other nonsentential segments smaller than a paragraph.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"The corpus currently contains about 60Mb of raw data, of which we have been concentrating on approximately 3.2Mb.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"Of this, 2.1Mb is text comprised of approximately 0.35 million English words, with the corresponding Chinese translation occupying the remaining 1.1Mb.","{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
STATISTICALLY-BASED,"{'title': 'THE ENGLISH-CHINESE CORPUS', 'number': '2'}"
"The statistical approach to alignment can be summarized as follows: choose the alignment that maximizes the probability over all possible alignments, given a pair of parallel texts.","{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
"Formally, where A is an alignment, and Ti and 7-2 are the English and Chinese texts, respectively.","{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
"An alignment A is a set consisting of L1 ,== L2 pairs where each L1 or L2 is an English or Chinese passage.","{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
This formulation is so extremely general that it is difficult to argue against its pure form.,"{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
More controversial are the approximations that must be made to obtain a tractable version.,"{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
"The first commonly made approximation is that the probabilities of the individual aligned pairs within an alignment are independent, i.e., The other common approximation is that each Pr(Li L2171 , 7-2) depends not on the entire texts, but only on the contents of the specific passages within the alignment: Maximization of this approximation to the alignment probabilities is easily converted into a minimum-sum problem: The minimization can be implemented using a dynamic programming strategy.","{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
Further approximations vary according to the specific method being used.,"{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
"Below, we first discuss a pure length-based approximation, then a method with lexical extensions.","{'title': 'ALIGNMENT', 'number': '3'}"
"Length-based alignment methods are based on the following approximation to equation (2): where l = length(Li) and /2 = length(L2), measured in number of characters.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In other words, the only feature of L1 and L2 that affects their alignment probability is their length.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
Note that there are other length-based alignment methods that measure length in number of words instead of characters (Brown et al. 1991).,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"However, since Chinese text consists of an unsegmented character stream without marked word boundaries, it would not be possible to count the number of words in a sentence without first parsing it.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Although it has been suggested that lengthbased methods are language-independent (Gale Sz Church 1991; Brown et al. 1991), they may in fact rely to some extent on length correlations arising from the historical relationships of the languages being aligned.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"If translated sentences share cognates, then the character lengths of those cognates are of course correlated.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
Grammatical similarities between related languages may also produce correlations in sentence lengths.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Moreover, the combinatorics of non-IndoEuropean languages can depart greatly from IndoEuropean languages.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In Chinese, the majority of words are just one or two characters long (though collocations up to four characters are also common).","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"At the same time, there are several thousand characters in daily use, as in conversation or newspaper text.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
Such lexical differences make it even less obvious whether pure sentence-length criteria are adequately discriminating for statistical alignment.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Our first goal, therefore, is to test whether purely length-based alignment results can be replicated for English and Chinese, languages from unrelated families.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"However, before length-based methods can be applied to Chinese, it is first necessary to generalize the notion of &quot;number of characters&quot; to Chinese strings, because most Chinese text (including our corpus) includes occasional English proper names and abbreviations, as well as punctuation marks.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Our approach is to count each Chinese character as having length 2, and each English or punctuation character as having length 1.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
This corresponds to the byte count for text stored in the hybrid English-Chinese encoding system known as Big 5.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
Gale & Church's (1991) length-based alignment method is based on the model that each English character in L1 is responsible for generating some number of characters in L2.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"This model leads to a further approximation which encapsulates the dependence to a single parameter .6 that is a function of /1 and /2: Pr(Li L2IL1, L2)',■+' Pr(Li L2 I6(11, 12)) However, it is much easier to estimate the distributions for the inverted form obtained by applying Bayes' Rule: where Pr(6) is a normalizing constant that can be ignored during minimization.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
The other two distributions are estimated as follows.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"First we choose a function for 6(4,12).","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
To do this we look at the relation between /1 and 12 under the generative model.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
Figure 1 shows a plot of English versus Chinese sentence lengths for a hand-aligned sample of 142 sentences.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"If the sentence lengths were perfectly correlated, the points would lie on a diagonal through the origin.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"We estimate the slope of this idealized diagonal c = E(r) = E(12 1 11) by averaging over the training corpus of hand-aligned L1 L2 pairs, weighting by the length of Li.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In fact this plot displays substantially greater scatter than the English-French data of Gale & Church (1991).4 The mean number of Chinese characters generated by each English character is c = 0.506, with a standard deviation o- = 0.166.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"We now assume that /2 — /1 c is normally distributed, following Gale & Church (1991), and transform it into a new gaussian variable of standard form (i.e., with mean 0 and variance 1) by appropriate normalization: This is the quantity that we choose to define as 6(/1,12).","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Consequently, for any two pairs in a proposed alignment, Pr(611,1 L2) can be estimated according to the gaussian assumption.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"To check how accurate the gaussian assumption is, we can use equation (4) to transform the same training points from figure 1 and produce a histogram.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
The result is shown in figure 2.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Again, the distribution deviates from a gaussian distribution substantially more than Gale & Church (1991) report for French/German/English.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Moreover, the distribution does not resemble any smooth distribution at all, including the logarithmic normal used by Brown et al. (1991), raising doubts about the potential performance of pure length-based alignment.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Continuing nevertheless, to estimate the other term Pr(Li .= L2), a prior over six classes is constructed, where the classes are defined by the number of passages included within L1 and L2.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
Table 1 shows the probabilities used.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
These probabilities are taken directly from Gale & Church (1991); slightly improved performance might be obtained by estimating these probabilities from our corpus.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"The aligned results using this model were evaluated by hand for the entire contents of a ranpoint that the Honourable Member has made to say that, when at the outset of our discussions I said that I did not think that the Government would be regarded for long as having been extravagant yesterday, I did not realize that the criticisms would begin quite as rapidly as they have.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"

"Also, (11, 12) shows an example of a 3-for-1, 1-for-1 sequence that the model has no choice but to align as 2-for-2, 2-for-2.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Judging relative to a manual alignment of the English and Chinese files, a total of 86.4% of the true L1 L2 pairs were correctly identified by the length-based method.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"However, many of the errors occurred within the introductory session header, whose format is domain-specific (discussed below).","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"If the introduction is discarded, then the proportion of correctly aligned pairs rises to 95.2%, a respectable rate especially in view of the drastic inaccuracies in the distributions assumed.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
A detailed breakdown of the results is shown in Table 2.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"For reference, results reported for English/French generally fall between 96% and 98%.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"However, all of these numbers should be interpreted as highly domain dependent, with very small sample size.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
The above rates are for Type I errors.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"The alternative measure of accuracy on Type II errors is useful for machine translation applications, where the objective is to extract only 1-for-1 sentence pairs, and to discard all others.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In this case, we are interested in the proportion of 1-for-1 output pairs that are true 1-for-1 pairs.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"(In information retrieval terminology, this measures precision whereas the above measures recall.)","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In the test session, 438 1-for-1 pairs were output, of which 377, or 86.1%, were true matches.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Again, however, by discarding the introduction, the accuracy rises to a surprising 96.3%.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"The introductory session header exemplifies a weakness of the pure length-based strategy, namely, its susceptibility to long stretches of passages with roughly similar lengths.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In our data this arises from the list of council members present and absent at each session (figure 4), but similar stretches can arise in many other domains.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In such a situation, two slight perturbations may cause the entire stretch of passages between the perturbations to be misaligned.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"These perturbations can easily arise from a number of causes, including slight omissions or mismatches in the original parallel texts, a 1-for-2 translation pair preceding or following the stretch of passages, or errors in the heuristic segmentation preprocessing.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Substantial penalties may occur at the beginning and ending boundaries of the misaligned region, where the perturbations lie, but the misalignment between those boundaries incurs little penalty, because the mismatched passages have apparently matching lengths.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
This problem is apparently exacerbated by the non-alphabetic nature of Chinese.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Because Chinese text contains fewer characters, character length is a less discriminating feature, varying over a range of fewer possible discrete values than the corresponding English.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
The next section discusses a solution to this problem.,"{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"In summary, we have found that the statistical correlation of sentence lengths has a far greater variance for our English-Chinese materials than with the Indo-European materials used by Gale & Church (1991).","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"Despite this, the pure lengthbased method performs surprisingly well, except for its weakness in handling long stretches of sentences with close lengths.","{'title': 'APPLICABILITY OF LENGTHBASED METHODS TO CHINESE', 'number': '4'}"
"To obtain further improvement in alignment accuracy requires matching the passages' lexical content, rather than using pure length criteria.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
This is particularly relevant for the type of long mismatched stretches described above.,"{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
Previous work on alignment has employed either solely lexical or solely statistical length criteria.,"{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"In contrast, we wish to incorporate lexical criteria without giving up the statistical approach, which provides a high baseline performance.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Our method replaces equation (3) with the following approximation: where vi = #occurrences(English cue, L1) and wi = #occurrences(Chinese cue, L2).","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Again, the dependence is encapsulated within difference parameters Si as follows: The prior Pr(Li =-• L2) is evaluated as before.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"We assume all Si values are approximately independent, giving (5) Pr(,30 , , on ILI L2) Pf.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"

"However, the computation and memory costs grow linearly with the number of lexical cues.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
This may not seem expensive until one considers that the pure length-based method only uses resources equivalent to that of a single lexical cue.,"{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
It is in fact important to choose as few lexical cues as possible to achieve the desired accuracy.,"{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Given the need to minimize the number of lexical cues chosen, two factors become important.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"First, a lexical cue should be highly reliable, so that violations, which waste the additional computation, happen only rarely.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Second, the chosen lexical cues should occur frequently, since computing the optimization over many zero counts is not useful.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"In general, these factors are quite domainspecific, so lexical cues must be chosen for the particular corpus at hand.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Note further that when these conditions are met, the exact probability distribution for the lexical Si parameters does not have much influence on the preferred alignment.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
The bilingual correspondence lexicons we have employed are shown in figure 5.,"{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"

The cues nearly always appear 1-to-1 and the differences Oi therefore have a mean of zero.,"{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Given the relative unimportance of the exact distributions, all were simply assumed to be normally distributed with a variance of 0.07 instead of sampling each parameter individually.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"This variance is fairly sharp, but nonetheless, conservatively reflects a lower reliability than most of the cues actually possess.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Using the lexical cue extensions, the Type I results on the same test file rise to 92.1% of true L1 L2 pairs correctly identified, as compared to 86.4% for the pure length-based method.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
The improvement is entirely in the introductory session header.,"{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Without the header, the rate is 95.0% as compared to 95.2% earlier (the discrepancy is insignificant and is due to somewhat arbitrary decisions made on anomolous regions).","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
"Again, caution should be exercised in interpreting these percentages.","{'title': 'STATISTICAL INCORPORATION OF LEXICAL CUES', 'number': '5'}"
