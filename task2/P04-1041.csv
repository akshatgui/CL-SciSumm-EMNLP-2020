"This paper shows how finite approximations of long distance dependency (LDD) resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) resources acquired from treebanks.",Introduction
"We extract LFG subcategorisation frames and paths linking LDDreentrancies from f-structures generated automati cally for the Penn-II treebank trees and use them in an LDD resolution algorithm to parse new text.Unlike (Collins, 1999; Johnson, 2002), in our ap proach resolution of LDDs is done at f-structure (attribute-value structure representations of basicpredicate-argument or dependency structure) with out empty productions, traces and coindexation in CFG parse trees.",Introduction
"Currently our best automaticallyinduced grammars achieve 80.97% f-score for f structures parsing section 23 of the WSJ part of the Penn-II treebank and evaluating against the DCU1051 and 80.24% against the PARC 700 Depen dency Bank (King et al, 2003), performing at the same or a slightly better level than state-of-the-art hand-crafted grammars (Kaplan et al, 2004).",Introduction
"The determination of syntactic structure is an important step in natural language processing as syntactic structure strongly determines semantic interpretation in the form of predicate-argument struc ture, dependency relations or logical form.",Experiment/Discussion
"For a substantial number of linguistic phenomena such as topicalisation, wh-movement in relative clausesand interrogative sentences, however, there is an important difference between the location of the (surface) realisation of linguistic material and the location where this material should be interpreted semantically.",Experiment/Discussion
"Resolution of such long-distance dependencies (LDDs) is therefore crucial in the determination of accurate predicate-argument struc1Manually constructed f-structures for 105 randomly se lected trees from Section 23 of the WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebankture, deep dependency relations and the construction of proper meaning representations such as log ical forms (Johnson, 2002).",Experiment/Discussion
"Modern unification/constraint-based grammarssuch as LFG or HPSG capture deep linguistic information including LDDs, predicate-argument structure, or logical form.",Experiment/Discussion
"Manually scaling rich uni fication grammars to naturally occurring free text, however, is extremely time-consuming, expensiveand requires considerable linguistic and computa tional expertise.",Experiment/Discussion
"Few hand-crafted, deep unification grammars have in fact achieved the coverage and robustness required to parse a corpus of say the size and complexity of the Penn treebank: (Riezler et al., 2002) show how a deep, carefully hand-craftedLFG is successfully scaled to parse the Penn-II treebank (Marcus et al, 1994) with discriminative (log linear) parameter estimation techniques.The last 20 years have seen continuously increas ing efforts in the construction of parse-annotated corpora.",Experiment/Discussion
"Substantial treebanks2 are now available for many languages (including English, Japanese, Chinese, German, French, Czech, Turkish), others are currently under construction (Arabic, Bulgarian) or near completion (Spanish, Catalan).",Experiment/Discussion
"Treebankshave been enormously influential in the develop ment of robust, state-of-the-art parsing technology:grammars (or grammatical information) automat ically extracted from treebank resources providethe backbone of many state-of-the-art probabilis tic parsing approaches (Charniak, 1996; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999; Hockenmaier, 2003; Kleinand Manning, 2003).",Experiment/Discussion
"Such approaches are attractive as they achieve robustness, coverage and performance while incurring very low grammar devel opment cost.",Experiment/Discussion

Many second gen eration treebanks provide a certain amount of deep syntactic or dependency information (e.g. in the form of Penn-II functional tags and traces) supporting the computation of representations ofdeep linguistic information.,Experiment/Discussion
"Exploiting this in formation (Cahill et al, 2002) implement an automatic LFG f-structure annotation algorithmthat associates nodes in treebank trees with f structure annotations in the form of attribute-valuestructure equations representing abstract predicate argument structure/dependency relations.",Experiment/Discussion
"From the f-structure annotated treebank they automatically extract wide-coverage, robust, PCFG-based LFG approximations that parse new text into trees and f-structure representations.",Experiment/Discussion
"The LFG approximations of (Cahill et al, 2002), however, are only ?half?",Experiment/Discussion
"grammars, i.e. like most of their probabilistic CFG cousins (Charniak, 1996; Johnson, 1999; Klein and Manning, 2003) they do not resolve LDDs but interpret linguistic material purely locally where it occurs in the tree.In this paper we show how finite approxima tions of long distance dependency resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic LFG resources automatically acquired from treebanks.",Experiment/Discussion
We extract LFG subcategorisation frames and paths linking LDD reentrancies fromf-structures generated automatically for the PennII treebank trees and use them in an LDD resolu tion algorithm to parse new text.,Experiment/Discussion
"Unlike (Collins, 1999; Johnson, 2002), in our approach LDDs are resolved on the level of f-structure representation,rather than in terms of empty productions and coindexation on parse trees.",Experiment/Discussion
"Currently we achieve f structure/dependency f-scores of 80.24 and 80.97for parsing section 23 of the WSJ part of the Penn II treebank, evaluating against the PARC 700 and DCU 105 respectively.",Experiment/Discussion
The paper is structured as follows: we give a brief introduction to LFG.,Experiment/Discussion
"We outline the automatic f-structure annotation algorithm, PCFG-based LFG grammar approximations and parsing architecturesof (Cahill et al, 2002).",Experiment/Discussion
We present our subcategorisation frame extraction and introduce the treebank based acquisition of finite approximations of LFG functional uncertainty equations in terms of LDD paths.,Experiment/Discussion

"Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bres nan, 1982; Dalrymple, 2001) minimally involves two levels of syntactic representation:3 c-structure and f-structure.",Experiment/Discussion
C(onstituent)-structure represents the grouping of words and phrases into largerconstituents and is realised in terms of a CF PSG grammar.,Experiment/Discussion
"F(unctional)-structure represents abstract syntactic functions such as SUBJ(ect), OBJ(ect), OBL(ique), closed and open clausal COMP/XCOMP(lement), ADJ(unct), APP(osition) etc. and is implemented in terms of recursive feature structures (attribute-value matrices).",Experiment/Discussion
"C-structurecaptures surface grammatical configurations, f structure encodes abstract syntactic information approximating to predicate-argument/dependency structure or simple logical form (van Genabithand Crouch, 1996).",Experiment/Discussion

"A slightly adapted version of (Magerman, 1994)?s scheme automatically head-lexicalises the Penn-II trees.",Experiment/Discussion
This partitions local subtrees of depth one (corresponding to CFG rules) into left and rightcontexts (relative to head).,Experiment/Discussion
The annotation algo rithm is modular with four components (Figure 2): left-right (L-R) annotation principles (e.g. leftmost NP to right of V head of VP type rule is likely to be an object etc.); coordination annotation principles (separating these out simplifies other componentsof the algorithm); traces (translates traces and coin dexation in trees into corresponding reentrancies in f-structure ( 1 in Figure 3)); catch all and clean-up.,Experiment/Discussion

"In LFG, LDDs are resolved at the f-structure level, obviating the need for empty productions and tracesin trees (Dalrymple, 2001), using functional uncer tainty (FU) equations.",Experiment/Discussion
FUs are regular expressions specifying paths in f-structure between a source(where linguistic material is encountered) and a target (where linguistic material is interpreted semantically).,Experiment/Discussion
"To account for the fronted sentential con stituents in Figures 3 and 4, an FU equation of the form ? TOPIC = ? COMP* COMP would be required.The equation states that the value of the TOPIC at tribute is token identical with the value of the finalCOMP argument along a path through the immedi ately enclosing f-structure along zero or more COMPattributes.",Experiment/Discussion

"As an example, for a topicalised con stituent to be resolved as the argument of a local predicate as specified by the FU equation, the local predicate must (i) subcategorise for the argument in question and (ii) the argument in question must not be already filled.",Experiment/Discussion
"Subcategorisation requirements are provided lexically in terms of semantic forms(subcat lists) and coherence and completeness con ditions (all GFs specified must be present, and noothers may be present) on f-structure representa tions.",Experiment/Discussion
Semantic forms specify which grammatical functions (GFs) a predicate requires locally.,Experiment/Discussion

FU equations and subcategorisation requirements together ensure that LDDs can only be resolved at suitable f-structure locations.,Experiment/Discussion
In order to model the LFG account of LDD resolu tion we require subcat frames (i.e. semantic forms)and LDD resolution paths through f-structure.,Experiment/Discussion
"Tra ditionally, such resources were handcoded.",Experiment/Discussion
Here weshow how they can be acquired from f-structure an notated treebank resources.LFG distinguishes between governable (arguments) and nongovernable (adjuncts) grammati cal functions (GFs).,Experiment/Discussion
"If the automatic f-structureannotation algorithm outlined in Section 3 generates high quality f-structures, reliable seman tic forms can be extracted (reverse-engineered): for each f-structure generated, for each level of embedding we determine the local PRED valueand collect the governable, i.e. subcategoris able grammatical functions present at that level of embedding.",Experiment/Discussion
"For the proper f-structure in Figure 3 we obtain sign([subj,obj]) and say([subj,comp]).",Experiment/Discussion
We extract frames from the full WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebank with48K trees.,Experiment/Discussion
"Unlike many other approaches, our ex traction process does not predefine frames, fully reflects LDDs in the source data-structures (cf.Figure 3), discriminates between active and passive frames, computes GF, GF:CFG category pair as well as CFG category-based subcategorisation frames and associates conditional probabilities with frames.",Experiment/Discussion
"Given a lemma l and an argument list s, the probability of s given l is estimated as: P(s|l) := count(l, s)?n i=1 count(l, si) Table 2 summarises the results.",Experiment/Discussion
We extract 3586 verb lemmas and 10969 unique verbal semanticform types (lemma followed by non-empty argu ment list).,Experiment/Discussion
"Including prepositions associated with the subcategorised OBLs and particles, this number goes up to 14348.",Experiment/Discussion
"The number of unique frametypes (without lemma) is 38 without specific prepositions and particles, 577 with.",Experiment/Discussion
F-structure anno tations allow us to distinguish passive and activeframes.,Experiment/Discussion

Some of these involve extensive clean up of the underlying Penn-II treebank resource prior to grammar extraction.,Results/Conclusion
"In contrast, in our approach we leave the treebank as is and only add (but never correct) annotations.",Results/Conclusion
"Earlier HPSG work (Tateisi et al, 1998) is based on independently constructedhand-crafted XTAG resources.",Results/Conclusion
"In contrast, we acquire our resources from treebanks and achieve sub stantially wider coverage.",Results/Conclusion
"Our approach provides wide-coverage, robust, and ? with the addition of LDD resolution ? ?deep?or ?full?, PCFG-based LFG approximations.",Results/Conclusion
"Crucially, we do not claim to provide fully adequate sta tistical models.",Results/Conclusion
"It is well known (Abney, 1997) that PCFG-type approximations to unification grammars can yield inconsistent probability models due toloss of probability mass: the parser successfully re turns the highest ranked parse tree but the constraint solver cannot resolve the f-equations (generated in the pipeline or ?hidden?",Results/Conclusion
in the integrated model) and the probability mass associated with that tree is lost.,Results/Conclusion
"This case, however, is surprisingly rare for our grammars: only 0.0018% (85 out of 48424) of theoriginal Penn-II trees (without FRAGs) fail to pro duce an f-structure due to inconsistent annotations(Table 1), and for parsing section 23 with the in tegrated model (A-PCFG), only 9 sentences do notreceive a parse because no f-structure can be gen erated for the highest ranked tree (0.4%).",Results/Conclusion
"Parsing with the pipeline model, all sentences receive onecomplete f-structure.",Results/Conclusion
Research on adequate probability models for unification grammars is important.,Results/Conclusion
"(Miyao et al, 2003) present a Penn-II treebank based HPSG with log-linear probability mod els.",Results/Conclusion
"They achieve coverage of 50.2% on section 23, as against 99% in our approach.",Results/Conclusion
"(Riezler etal., 2002; Kaplan et al, 2004) describe how a care fully hand-crafted LFG is scaled to the full Penn-II treebank with log-linear based probability models.",Results/Conclusion
They achieve 79% coverage (full parse) and 21% fragement/skimmed parses.,Results/Conclusion
"By the same measure,full parse coverage is around 99% for our automat ically acquired PCFG-based LFG approximations.Against the PARC 700, the hand-crafted LFG grammar reported in (Kaplan et al, 2004) achieves an f score of 79.6%.",Results/Conclusion
"For the same experiment, our best automatically-induced grammar achieves an f-score of 80.24%.",Results/Conclusion
"We presented and extensively evaluated a finiteapproximation of LDD resolution in automatically constructed, wide-coverage, robust, PCFG based LFG approximations, effectively turning the ?half?(or ?shallow?)-grammars presented in (Cahill et al, 2002) into ?full?",Results/Conclusion
or ?deep?,Results/Conclusion
grammars.,Results/Conclusion
"In our approach, LDDs are resolved in f-structure, not trees.",Results/Conclusion
"The method achieves a preds-only f-score of 80.97% for f-structures with the PA-PCFG in the integrated architecture against the DCU 105and 78.4% against the 2,416 automatically gener ated f-structures for the original Penn-II treebanktrees.",Results/Conclusion
"Evaluating against the PARC 700 Depen dency Bank, the P-PCFG achieves an f-score of 80.24%, an overall improvement of approximately 0.6% on the result reported for the best hand-crafted grammars in (Kaplan et al, 2004).",Results/Conclusion
