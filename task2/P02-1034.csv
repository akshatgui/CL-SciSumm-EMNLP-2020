This paper introduces new learning al gorithms for natural language processing based on the perceptron algorithm.,{}

"The perceptron algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms in machine learning, going back to (Rosen blatt 1958).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It is an incredibly simple algorithm toimplement, and yet it has been shown to be com petitive with more recent learning methods such as support vector machines ? see (Freund & Schapire 1999) for its application to image classification, for example.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
