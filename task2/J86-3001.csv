In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse.,{}
"In this theory, discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of utterances (called the linguistic structure), a structure of purposes (called the intentional structure), and the state of focus of attention (called the attentional state).",{}
The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate.,{}
"The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes, expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them.",{}
The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds.,{}
"The attentional state, being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse.",{}
"The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions.",{}
"The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses.",{}
"Various properties of discourse are described, and explanations for the behavior of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions are explored.",{}
This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse.,{}
"Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments, recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions, and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state.",{}
This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants' knowledge of the domain.,{}

This paper presents the basic elements of a computational theory of discourse structure that simplifies and expands upon previous work.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"By specifying the basic units a discourse comprises and the ways in which they can relate, a proper account of discourse structure provides the basis for an account of discourse meaning.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
An account of discourse structure also plays a central role in language processing because it stipulates constraints on those portions of a discourse to which any given utterance in the discourse must be related.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
An account of discourse structure is closely related to two questions: What individuates a discourse?,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
What makes it coherent?,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"That is, faced with a sequence of utterances, how does one know whether they constitute a single discourse, several (perhaps interleaved) discourses, or none?","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"As we develop it, the theory of discourse structure will be seen to be intimately connected with two nonlinguistic notions: intention and attention.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Attention is an essential factor in explicating the processing of utterances in discourse.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Intentions play a primary role in explaining discourse structure, defining discourse coherence, and providing a coherent conceptualization of the term &quot;discourse&quot; itself.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"

"The theory is a further development and integration of two lines of research: work on focusing in discourse (Grosz 1978a, 1978b, 1981) and more recent work on intention recognition in discourse (Sidner and Israel 1981; Sidner 1983; 1985; Allen 1983, Litman 1985; Pollack 1986).","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Our goal has been to generalize these constructs properly to a wide range of discourse types.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Grosz (1978a) demonstrated that the notions of focusing and task structure are necessary for understanding and producing task-oriented dialogue.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"One of the main generalizations of previous work will be to show that discourses are generally in some sense &quot;task-oriented,&quot; but the kinds of &quot;tasks&quot; that can be engaged in are quite varied — some are physical, some mental, others linguistic.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Consequently, the term &quot;task&quot; is misleading; we therefore will use the more general terminology of intentions (e.g., when speaking of discourse purposes) for most of what we say.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Our main thesis is that the structure of any discourse is a composite of three distinct but interacting components: The distinction among these components is essential to an explanation of interruptions (see Section 5), as well as to explanations of the use of certain types of referring expressions (see Section 4.2) and various other expressions that affect discourse segmentation and structure (see Section 6).","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Most related work on discourse structure (including Reichman-Adar 1984, Linde 1979, Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983) fails to distinguish among some (or, in some cases, all) of these components.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"As a result, significant generalizations are lost, and the computational mechanisms proposed are more complex than necessary.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"By carefully distinguishing these components, we are able to account for significant observations in this related work while simplifying both the explanations given and computational mechanisms used.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition to explicating these linguistic phenomena, the theory provides an overall framework within which to answer questions about the relevance of various segments of discourse to one another and to the overall purposes of the discourse participants.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Various properties of the intentional component have implications for research in natural-language processing in general.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"In particular, the intentions that underlie discourse are so diverse that approaches to discourse coherence based on selecting discourse relationships from a fixed set of alternative rhetorical patterns (e.g., Hobbs 1979, Mann and Thompson 1983, Reichman 1981) are unlikely to suffice.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
The intentional structure introduced in this paper depends instead on a small number of structural relations that can hold between intentions.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"This study also reveals several problems that must be confronted in expanding speech-act-related theories (e.g., Allen and Perrault 1980, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Allen 1983) from coverage of individual utterances to coverage of extended sequences of utterances in discourse.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Although a definition of discourse must await further development of the theory presented in this paper, some properties of the phenomena we want to explain must be specified now.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"In particular, we take a discourse to be a piece of language behavior that typically involves multiple utterances and multiple participants.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
A discourse may be produced by one or more of these participants as speakers or writers; the audience may comprise one or more of the participants as hearers or readers.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Because in multi-party conversations more than one participant may speak (or write) different utterances within a segment, the terms speaker and hearer do not differentiate the unique roles that the participants maintain in a segment of a conversation.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
We will therefore use the terms initiating conversational participant (ICP) and other conversational participant(s) (OCP) to distinguish the initiator of a discourse segment from its other participants.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"The ICP speaks (or writes) the first utterance of a segment, but an OCP may be the speaker of some subsequent utterances.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"By speaking of ICPs and OCPs, we can highlight the purposive aspect of discourse.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
We will use the terms speaker and hearer only when the particular speaking/hearing activity is important for the point being made.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"In most of this paper, we will be concerned with developing an abstract model of discourse structure; in particular, the definitions of the components will abstract away from the details of the discourse participants.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Whether one constructs a computer system that can participate in a discourse (i.e., one that is a language user) or defines a psychological theory of language use, the task will require the appropriate projection of this abstract model onto properties of a language user, and specification of additional details (e.g., specifying memory for linguistic structure, means for encoding attentional state, and appropriate representations of intentional structure).","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"We do, however, address ourselves directly to certain processing issues that are essential to the computational validity of the [abstract] model and to its utilization for a language-processing system or psychological theory.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Finally, it is important to note that although discourse meaning is a significant, unsolved problem, we will not address it in this paper.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
An adequate theory of discourse meaning needs to rest at least partially on an adequate theory of discourse structure.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Our concern is with providing the latter.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
The next section examines the basic theory of discourse structure and presents an overview of each of the components of discourse structure.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Section 3 analyzes two sample discourses — a written text and a fragment of task-oriented dialogue — from the perspective of the theory being developed; these two examples are also used to illustrate various points in the remainder of the paper.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Section 4 investigates various processing issues that the theory raises.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"The following two sections describe the role of the discourse structure components in explaining various properties of discourse, thereby corroborating the necessity of distinguishing among its three components.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Section 7 describes the generalization from utterance-level to discourse-level intentions, establishes certain properties of the latter, and contrasts them with the rhetorical relations of alternative theories.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Finally, Section 8 poses a number of outstanding research questions suggested by the theory.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Discourse structure is a composite of three interacting constituents: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
These three constituents of discourse structure deal with different aspects of the utterances in a discourse.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Utterances — the actual saying or writing of particular sequences of phrases and clauses — are the linguistic structure's basic elements.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Intentions of a particular sort and a small number of relationships between them provide the basic elements of the intentional structure.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Attentional state contains information about the objects, properties, relations, and discourse intentions that are most salient at any given point.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"It is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the discourse participants; it serves to summarize information from previous utterances crucial for processing subsequent ones, thus obviating the need for keeping a complete history of the discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Together the three constituents of discourse structure supply the information needed by the CPs to determine how an individual utterance fits with the rest of the discourse — in essence, enabling them to figure out why it was said and what it means.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The context provided by these constituents also forms the basis for certain expectations about what is to come; these expectations play a role in accommodating new utterances.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The attentional state serves an additional purpose: namely, it furnishes the means for actually using the information in the other two structures in generating and interpreting individual utterances.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The first component of discourse structure is the structure of the sequence of utterances that comprise a discourse.1 Just as the words in a single sentence form constituent phrases, the utterances in a discourse are naturally aggregated into discourse segments.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The utterances in a segment, like the words in a phrase, serve particular roles with respect to that segment.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"In addition, the discourse segments, like the phrases, fulfill certain functions with respect to the overall discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Although two consecutive utterances may be in the same discourse segment, it is also common for two consecutive utterances to be in different segments.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
It is also possible for two utterances that are nonconsecutive to be in the same segment.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The factoring of discourses into segments has been observed across a wide range of discourse types.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Grosz (1978a) showed this for task-oriented dialogues.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Linde (1979) found it valid for descriptions of apartments; Linde and Goguen (1978) describe such structuring in the Watergate transcripts.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Reichman-Adar (1984) observed it in informal debates, explanations, and therapeutic discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Cohen (1983) found similar structures in essays in rhetorical texts.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Polanyi and Scha (1986) discuss this feature of narratives.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Although different researchers with different theories have examined a variety of discourse types and found discourse-level segmentation, there has been very little investigation of the extent of agreement about where the segment boundaries lie.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
There have been no psychological studies of the consistency of recognition of section boundaries.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"However, Mann (Mann et al. 1975) asked several people to segment a set of dialogues.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"He has reported [personal communication] that his subjects segmented the discourses approximately the same; their disagreements were about utterances at the boundaries of segments.2 Several studies of spontaneously produced discourses provide additional evidence of the existence of segment boundaries, as well as suggesting some of the linguistic cues available for detecting boundaries.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Chafe (1979, 1980) found differences in pause lengths at segment boundaries.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Butterworth (1975) found speech rate differences that correlated with segments; speech rate is slower at start of a segment than toward the end.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The linguistic structure consists of the discourse segments and an embedding relationship that can hold between them.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"As we discuss in Sections 2.2 and 5, the embedding relationships are a surface reflection of relationships among elements of the intentional structure.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
It is important to recognize that the linguistic structure is not strictly decompositional.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
An individual segment may include a combination of subsegments and utterances only in that segment (and not members of any of its embedded subsegments).,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Both of the examples in Section 3 exhibit such nonstrict decompositionality.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Because the linguistic structure is not strictly decompositional, various properties of the discourse (most notably the intentional structure) are functions of properties of individual utterances and properties of segments.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"There is a two-way interaction between the discourse segment structure and the utterances constituting the discourse: linguistic expressions can be used to convey information about the discourse structure; conversely, the discourse structure constrains the interpretation of expressions (and hence affects what a speaker says and how a hearer will interpret what is said).","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Not surprisingly, linguistic expressions are among the primary indicators of discourse segment boundaries.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The explicit use of certain words and phrases (e.g., in the first place) and more subtle cues, such as intonation or changes in tense and aspect, are included in the repertoire of linguistic devices that function, wholly or in part, to indicate these boundaries (Grosz 1978a, Reichman-Adar 1984, Cohen 1983, Polanyi and Scha 1983, Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986).","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Reichman (1981) discusses some words that function in this way and coined the term clue words.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
We will use the term cue phrases to generalize on her observation as well as many others because each one of these devices cue the hearer to some change in the discourse structure.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"As discussed in Section 6, these linguistic boundary markers can be divided according to whether they explicitly indicate changes in the intentional structure or in the attentional state of the discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The differential use of these linguistic markers provides one piece of evidence for considering these two components to be distinct.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Because these linguistic devices function explicitly as indicators of discourse structure, it becomes clear that they are best seen as providing information at the discourse level, and not at the sentence level; hence, certain kinds of questions (e.g., about their contribution to the truth conditions of an individual sentence) do not make sense.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, in the utterance Incidentally, Jane swims every day, the incidentally indicates an interruption of the main flow of discourse rather than affecting in any way the meaning of Jane swims every day.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Jane's swimming every day could hardly be fortuitous.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Just as linguistic devices affect structure, so the discourse segmentation affects the interpretation of linguistic expressions in a discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Referring expressions provide the primary example of this effect.3 The segmentation of discourse constrains the use of referring expressions by delineating certain points at which there is a significant change in what entities (objects, properties, or relations) are being discussed.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, there are different constraints on the use of pronouns and reduced definite-noun phrases within a segment than across segment boundaries.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"While discourse segmentation is obviously not the only factor governing the use of referring expressions, it is an important one.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"A rather straightforward property of discourses, namely, that they (or, more accurately, those who participate in them) have an overall purpose, turns out to play a fundamental role in the theory of discourse structure.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"In particular, some of the purposes that underlie discourses, and their component segments, provide the means of individuating discourses and of distinguishing discourses that are coherent from those that are not.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
These purposes also make it possible to determine when a sequence of utterances comprises more than one discourse.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Although typically the participants in a discourse may have more than one aim in participating in the discourse (e.g., a story may entertain its listeners as well as describe an event; an argument may establish a person's brilliance as well as convince someone that a claim or allegation is true), we distinguish one of these purposes as foundational to the discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
We will refer to it as the discourse purpose (DP).,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"From an intuitive perspective, the discourse purpose is the intention that underlies engaging in the particular discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"This intention provides both the reason a discourse (a linguistic act), rather than some other action, is being performed and the reason the particular content of this discourse is being conveyed rather than some other information.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For each of the discourse segments, we can also single out one intention — the discourse segment purpose (DSP).","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"From an intuitive standpoint, the DSP specifies how this segment contributes to achieving the overall discourse purpose.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The assumption that there are single such intentions will in the end prove too strong.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"However, this assumption allows us to describe the basic theory mare clearly.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
We must leave to future research (and a subsequent paper) the exploration and discussion of the complications that result from relaxing this assumption.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Typically, an ICP will have a number of different kinds of intentions that lead to initiating a discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
One kind might include intentions to speak in a certain language or to utter certain words.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Another might include intentions to amuse or to impress.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The kinds of intentions that can serve as discourse purposes or discourse segment purposes are distinguished from other intentions by the fact that they are intended to be recognized (cf.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Allen and Perrault 1980, Sidner 1985), whereas other intentions are private; that is, the recognition of the DP or DSP is essential to its achieving its intended effect.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Discourse purposes and discourse segment purposes share this property with certain utterance-level intentions that Grice (1969) uses in defining utterance meaning (see Section 7).,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
It is important to distinguish intentions that are intended to be recognized from other kinds of intentions that are associated with discourse.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Intentions that are intended to be recognized achieve their intended effect only if the intention is recognized.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, a compliment achieves its intended effect only if the intention to compliment is recognized; in contrast, a scream of boo typically achieves its intended effect (scaring the hearer) without the hearer having to recognize the speaker's intention.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Some intention that is private and not intended to be recognized may be the primary motivation for an ICP to begin a discourse.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the ICP may intend to impress someone or may plan to teach someone.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
In neither case is the ICP's intention necessarily intended to be recognized.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Quite the opposite may be true in the case of impressing, as the ICP may not want the OCP to be aware of his intention.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"When teaching, the ICP may not care whether the OCP knows the ICP is teaching him or her.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, the intention that motivates the ICP to engage in a discourse may be private.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"By contrast, the discourse segment purpose is always intended to be recognized.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
DPs and DSPs are basically the same sorts of intentions.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"If an intention is a DP, then its satisfaction is a main purpose of the discourse, whereas if it is a DSP, then its satisfaction contributes to the satisfaction of the DP.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The following are some of the types of intentions that could serve as DP/DSPs, followed by one example of each type.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
We have identified two structural relations that play an important role in discourse structure: dominance and satisfaction-precedence.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"An action that satisfies one intention, say DSP1, may be intended to provide part of the satisfaction of another, say DSP2.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"When this is the case, we will say that DSP1 contributes to DSP2; conversely, we will say that DSP2 dominates DSP1 (or DSP2 DOM DSP1).","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The dominance relation invokes a partial ordering on DSPs that we will refer to as the dominance hierarchy.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For some discourses, including task-oriented ones, the order in which the DSPs are satisfied may be significant, as well as being intended to be recognized.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"We will say that DSP1 satisfaction-precedes DSP2 (or, DSP1 SP DSP2) whenever DSP1 must be satisfied before DSP2.4 Any of the intentions on the preceding list could be either a DP or a DSP.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Furthermore, a given instance of any one of them could contribute to another, or to a different, instance of the same type.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the intention that someone intend to identify some object might dominate several intentions that she or he know some property of that object; likewise, the intention to get someone to believe some fact might dominate a number of contributing intentions that that person believe other facts.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"As the above list makes clear, the range of intentions that can serve as discourse, or discourse segment, purposes is open-ended (cf.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Wittgenstein 1953: paragraph 23), much like the range of intentions that underlie more general purposeful action.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"There is no finite list of discourse purposes, as there is, say, of syntactic categories.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
It remains an unresolved research question whether there is a finite description of the open-ended set of such intentions.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"However, even if there were finite descriptions, there would still be no finite list of intentions from which to choose.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, a theory of discourse structure cannot depend on choosing the DP/DSPs from a fixed list (cf.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Reichman-Adar 1984, Schank et al. 1982, Mann and Thompson 1983), nor on the particulars of individual intentions.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Although the particulars of individual intentions, like a wide range of common sense knowledge, are crucial to understanding any discourse, such particulars cannot serve as the basis for determining discourse structure.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
What is essential for discourse structure is that such intentions bear certain kinds of structural relationships to one another.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Since the CPs can never know the whole set of intentions that might serve as DP/DSPs, what they must recognize is the relevant structural relationships among intentions.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Although there is an infinite number of intentions, there are only a small number of relations relevant to discourse structure that can hold between them.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
In this paper we distinguish between the determination of the DSP and the recognition of it.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"We use the term determination to refer to a semantic-like notion, namely, the complete specification of what is intended by whom; we use the term recognition to refer to a processing notion, namely, the processing that leads a discourse participant to identify what the intention is.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
These are obviously related concepts; the same information that determines a DSP may be used by an OCP to recognize it.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"

"For example, the question of when the information becomes available is not relevant to determination but is crucial to recognition.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
An analogous distinction has been drawn with respect to sentence structure; the parse tree (determination) is differentiated from the parsing process (recognition) that produces the tree.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The third component of discourse structure, the attentional state, is an abstraction of the participants' focus of attention as their discourse unfolds.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The attentional state is a property of the discourse itself, not of the discourse participants.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"It is inherently dynamic, recording the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point in the discourse.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The attentional state is modeled by a set of focus spaces; changes in attentional state are modeled by a set of transition rules that specify the conditions for adding and deleting spaces.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
We call the collection of focus spaces available at any one time the focusing structure and the process of manipulating spaces focusing.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The focusing process associates a focus space with each discourse segment; this space contains those entities that are salient — either because they have been mentioned explicitly in the segment or because they became salient in the process of producing or comprehending the utterances in the segment (as in the original work on focusing: Grosz 1978a).,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The focus space also includes the DSP; the inclusion of the purpose reflects the fact that the CPs are focused not only on what they are talking about, but also on why they are talking about it.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"To understand the attentional state component of discourse structure, it is important not to confuse it with two other concepts.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"First, the attentional state component is not equivalent to cognitive state, but is only one of its components.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Cognitive state is a richer structure, one that includes at least the knowledge, beliefs, desires, and intentions of an agent, as well as the cognitive correlates of the attentional state as modeled in this paper.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, although each focus space contains a DSP, the focus structure does not include the intentional structure as a whole.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Figure 1 illustrates how the focusing structure, in addition to modeling attentional state, serves during processing to coordinate the linguistic and intentional structures.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The discourse segments (to the left of the figure) are tied to focus spaces (drawn vertically down the middle of the figure).,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The focusing structure is a stack.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Information in lower spaces is usually accessible from higher ones (but less so than the information in the higher spaces); we use a line with intersecting hash marks to denote when this is not the case.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Subscripted terms are used to indicate the relevant contents of the focus spaces because the spaces contain representations of entities (i.e., objects, properties, and relations) and not linguistic expressions.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Part one of Figure 1 shows the state of focusing when discourse segment DS2 is being processed.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Segment DS1 gave rise to FS1 and had as its discourse purpose DSPi.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The properties, objects, relations, and purpose represented in FS1 are accessible but less salient than those in FS2.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"DS2 yields a focus space that is stacked relative to FS1 because DSP, of DS1 dominates DS2's DSP, DSP2.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"As a result of the relationship between FS1 and FS2, reduced noun phrases will be interpreted differently in DS2 than in DS1.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, if some red balls exist in the world one of which is represented in DS2 and another in FS1, then the red ball used in DS2 will be understood to mean the particular red ball that is represented in DS2.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"If, however, there is also a green truck (in the world) and it is represented only in FS1, the green truck uttered in DS2 will be understood as referring to that green truck.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Part two of Figure 1 shows the state of focusing when segment DS3 is being processed.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"FS2 has been popped from the stack and FS3 has been pushed onto it because the DSP of DS3, DSP3, is dominated solely by DSPi, not by DSP2.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"In this example, the intentional structure includes only dominance relationships, although, it may, in general, also include satisfaction-precedence relationships.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The stacking of focus spaces reflects the relative salience of the entities in each space during the corresponding segment's portion of the discourse.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The stack relationships arise from the ways in which the various DSPs relate; information about such relationships is represented in the dominance hierarchy (depicted on the right in the figure).,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The spaces in Figure 1 are• snapshots illustrating the results of a sequence of operations, such as pushes onto and pops from a stack.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
A push occurs when the DSP for a new segment contributes to the DSP for the immediately preceding segment.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"When the DSP contributes to some intention higher in the dominance hierarchy, several focus spaces are popped from the stack before the new one is inserted.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Two essential properties of the focusing structure are now clear.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"First, the focusing structure is parasitic upon the intentional structure, in the sense that the relationships among DSPs determine pushes and pops.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Note however, that the relevant operation may sometimes be indicated in the language itself.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the cue word first often indicates the start of a segment whose DSP contributes to the DSP of the preceding segment.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, the focusing structure, like the intentional and linguistic structures, evolves as the discourse proceeds.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
None of them exists a priori.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Even in those rare cases in which an ICP has a complete plan for the discourse prior to uttering a single word, the intentional structure is constructed by the CPs as the discourse progresses.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"This discourse-time construction of the intentional structure may be more obviously true for speakers and hearers of spoken discourse than for readers and writers of texts, but, even for the writer, the intentional structure is developed as the text is being written.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
Figure 1 illustrates some fundamental distinctions between the intentional and attentional components of discourse structure.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"First, the dominance hierarchy provides, among other things, a complete record of the discourse-level intentions and their dominance (as well as, when relevant, satisfaction-precedence) relationships, whereas the focusing structure at any one time can essentially contain only information that is relevant to purposes in a portion of the dominance hierarchy.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, at the conclusion of a discourse, if it completes normally, the focus stack will be empty, while the intentional structure will have been fully constructed.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Third, when the discourse is being processed, only the attentional state can constrain the interpretation of referring expressions directly.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"We can now also clarify some misinterpretations of focus-space diagrams and task structure in our earlier work (Grosz 1978a, 1981, 1974).","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
The focus-space hierarchies in that work are best seen as representing attentional state.,"{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"The task structure was used in two ways: Although the same representational scheme was used for encoding the focus-space hierarchies and the task structure (partitioned networks: Hendrix 1979), the two structures were distinct.","{'title': '2 THE BASIC THEORY', 'number': '3'}"
"Barbara J. Grosz and Candace L. Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse Several researchers (e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Reichman-Adar 1984) misinterpreted the original research in an unfortunate and unintended way: they took the focus-space hierarchy to include (or be identical to) the task structure.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"The conflation of these two structures forces a single structure to contain information about attentional state, intentional relationships, and general task, knowledge.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"It prevents a theory from accounting adequately for certain aspects of discourse, including interruptions (see Section 5).","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
A second instance of confusion was to infer (incorrectly) that the task structure was necessarily a prebuilt tree.,"{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"If the task structure is taken to be a special case of intentional structure, it becomes clear that the tree structure is simply a more constrained structure than one might require for other discourses; the nature of the task related to the task-oriented discourse is such that the dominance hierarchy of the intentional structure of the dialogue has both dominance and satisfaction-precedence relationships,5 while other discourses may not exhibit significant precedence constraints among the DSPs.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"Furthermore, there has never been any reason to assume that the task structures in task-oriented dialogues are prebuilt, any more than the intentional structure of any other kind of discourses.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"It is rather that one objective of discourse theory (not a topic considered here, however) is to explain how the OCP builds up a model of the task structure by using information supplied in the discourse.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"However, it is important to note that conflating the aforementioned two roles of information about the task itself (as a portion of general commonsense knowledge and as a special case of intentional structure) was regrettable, as it fails to make an important distinction.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"Furthermore, as is clear when intentional structures are considered more generally, such a conflation of roles does not allow for differences between what one knows about a task and one's intentions for (or what one makes explicit in discourse about) performing a task.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"In summary, the focusing structure is the central repository for the contextual information needed to process utterances at each point in the discourse.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"It distinguishes those objects, properties, and relations that are most salient at that point and, moreover, has links to relevant parts of both the linguistic and intentional structures.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"During a discourse, an increasing amount of information, only some of which continues to be needed for the interpretation of subsequent utterances, is discussed.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"Hence, it becomes more and more necessary to be able to identify relevant discourse segments, the entities they make salient, and their DSPs.","{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
The role of attentional state in delineating the information necessary for understanding is thus central to discourse processing.,"{'title': 'DISCOURSE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '4'}"
"To illustrate the basic theory we have just sketched, we will give a brief analysis of two kinds of discourse: an argument from a rhetoric text and a task-oriented dialogue.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"For each example we discuss the segmentation of the discourse, the intentions that underlie this segmentation, and the relationships among the various DSPs.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In each case, we point out some of the linguistic devices used to indicate segment boundaries as well as some of the expressions whose interpretations depend on those boundaries.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The analysis is concerned with specifying certain aspects of the behavior to be explicated by a theory of discourse; the remainder of the paper provides a partial account of this behavior.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
Our first example is an argument taken from a rhetoric text (Holmes and Gallagher 19176).,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
It is an example used by Cohen (1983) in her work on the structure of arguments.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
Figure 2 shows the dialogue and the eight discourse segments of which it is composed.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The division of the argument into separate (numbered) clauses is Cohen's, but our analysis of the discourse structure is different, since in Cohen's analysis, every utterance is directly subordinated to another utterance, and there is only one structure to encode linguistic segmentation and the purposes of utterances.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Although both analyses segment utterance (4) separately from utterances (1-3), some readers place this utterance in DS1 with utterances (1) through (3); this is an example of the kind of disagreement about boundary utterances found in Mann's data (as discussed in Section 2.1).","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The two placements lead to slightly different DSPs, but not to radically different intentional structures.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Because the differences do not affect the major thrust of the argument, we will discuss only one segmentation.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 Figure 3 lists the primary component of the DSP for each of these segments and Figure 4 shows the dominance relationships that hold among these intentions.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In Section 7 we discuss additional components of the discourse segment purpose; because these additional components are more important for completeness of the theory than for determining the essential dominance and satisfaction-precedence relationships between DSPs, we omit such details here.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Rather than commit ourselves to a formal language in which to express the intentions of the discourse, we will use a shorthand notation and English sentences that are intended to be a gloss for a formal statement of the actual intentions.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"

"Some of these propositions, such as P5 and P6, can be read off the surface utterances directly.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Other propositions and the intentions of which they are part, such as P2 and 12, ar,e mote indirect.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Like the Gricean utterancetlevel intentions (the analogy with these will be explored in Section 7), DSPs may or may not be directly expressed in the discourse.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In particular, they may be expressed in any of the following ways: Not only may information about the DSP be conveyed by a number of features of the utterances in a discourse, but it also may come in any utterance in a segment.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, although IO is the DP, it is stated directly only in the last utterance of the essay.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"This leads to a number of questions about the ways in which OCPs can recognize discourse purposes, and about those junctures at which they need to do so.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
We turn to these matters directly in Subsection 4.1.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
This discourse also provides several examples of the different kinds of interactions that can hold between the linguistic expressions in a discourse and the discourse structure.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"It includes examples of the devices that may be used to mark overtly the boundaries between discourse segments — examples of the use of aspect, mood, and particular cue phrases — as well as of the use of referring expressions that are affected by discourse segment boundaries.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The use of cue phrases to indicate discourse boundaries is illustrated in utterances (9) and (11); in (9) the phrase in the first place marks the beginning of DS5 while in (11) moreover ends DS5 and marks the start of DS6.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"These phrases also carry information about the intentional structure, namely, that DSP5 and DSP6 are dominated by DSP4.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In some cases, cue phrases have multiple functions; they convey propositional content as well as marking discourse segment boundaries.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The but in utterance (7) is an example of such a multiple function use.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The boundaries between DS1 and DS2, DS4 and DS5, and DS4 and DS2 reflect changes of aspect and mood.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The switch from declarative, present tense to interrogative modal aspect does not in itself seem to signal the boundary (for recognition purposes) in this discourse unambiguously, but it does indicate a possible line of demarcation which, in fact, is valid.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The effect of segmentation on referring expressions is shown by the use of the generic noun phrase a moving picture show in (4).,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Although a reference to the movies was made with a pronoun (their) in (3), a full noun phrase is used in (4).","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"This use reflects, and perhaps in part marks, the boundary between the segments DS1 and DS2.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Finally, this discourse has an example of the trade-off between explicitly marking a discourse boundary, as well as the relationship between the associated DSPs, and reasoning about the intentions themselves.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
There is no overt linguistic marker of the beginning of DS7; its separation must be inferred from DSP7 and its relationship to DSP6.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The second example is a fragment of a task-oriented dialogue taken from Grosz (1981; it is from the same corpus that was used by Grosz 1974).,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Figure 5 contains the dialogue fragment and indicates the boundaries for its main segments.7 Figure 6 gives the primary component of the DSPs for this fragment and shows the dominance rela,1ionships between them.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In contrast with the movies essay, the primary components of the DSPs in this dialogue are mostly intentions of the segment's ICP that the OCP intend to perform some action.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Also, unlike the essay, the dialogue has two agents initiating the different discourse segments.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In this particular segment, the expert is the ICP of DS1 and DS5, while the apprentice is the ICP of DS2-4.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"To furnish a complete account of the intentional structure of this discourse, one must be able to say how the satisfaction of one agent's intentions can contribute to satisfying the intentions of another agent.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Such an account is beyond the scope of this paper, but in Section 7 we discuss some of the complexities involved in providing one (as well as its role in discourse theory).","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"For the purposes of discussing this example, though, we need to postulate two properties of the relationships among the participants' intentions.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
These properties seem to be rooted in features of cooperative behavior and depend on the two participants' sharing some particular knowledge of the task.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"First, it is a shared belief that, unless he states otherwise, the OCP will adopt the intention to perform an action that the ICP intended him to.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Second, in adopting the intention to carry out that action, the OCP also intends to perform whatever subactions are necessary.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, once the apprentice intends to remove the flywheel, he also commits himself to the collateral intentions of loosening the setscrews and pulling the wheel off.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Note, however, that not all the subactions need to be introduced explicitly into the discourse.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The apprentice may do several actions that are never mentioned, and the expert may assume that these are being undertaken on the basis of other information that the apprentice obtains.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"

The wheel should slide off.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"As in the movies essay, some of the DSPs for this dialogue are expressed directly in utterances.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"For instance, utterances (1), (5), and (12) directly express the primary components of DSP!, DSP2 and DSP3, respectively.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The primary component of DSP4 is a derived intention.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The surface intention of but I'm having trouble getting the wheel off is that the apprentice intends the expert to believe that the apprentice is having trouble taking off the flywheel.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"14 is derived from the utterance and its surface intention, as well as from features of discourse, conventions about what intentions are associated with the I am having trouble doing X type of utterance, and what the ICP and OCP know about the task they have undertaken.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The dominance relationship that holds between Il and 12, as well as the one that holds between Il and 13, may seem problematic at first glance.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
It is not clear how locating any single setscrew contributes to removing the flywheel.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"It is even less clear how, in and of itself, identifying another tool does.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Two facts provide the link. first, that the apprentice (the OCP of DS1) has taken on the task of removing the flywheel; second, that the apprentice and expert share certain knowledge about the task.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Some of this shared task knowledge comes from the discourse per se [e.g., utterance (3)], but some of it comes from general knowledge, perceptual information, and the like.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, a combination of information is relevant to determining 12 and 13 and their relationships to 1, including all of the following: the fact that Ii is part of the intentional structure, the fact that the apprentice is currently working on satisfying Ii, the utterance-level intentions of utterances (5) and (12), and general knowledge about the task.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The satisfaction-precedence relations among 12, 13, and 14 are not communicated directly in the dialogue, but, like dominance relations, depend on domain knowledge.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
One piece of relevant knowledge is that a satisfaction precedence relation exists between loosening the setscrews and pulling off the flywheel.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"That relation is shared knowledge that is stated directly (First loosen ..., then pull).","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The relation, along with the fact that both 12 and 13 contribute to loosening the setscrews, and that 14 contributes to pulling off the flywheel, makes it possible to conclude 13 SP 14 and 12 SP 14.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"To conclude that 12 SP 13, the apprentice must employ knowledge of how to go about loosening screw-like objects.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The dominance and satisfaction-precedence relations for this task-oriented fragment form a tree of intentions rather than just a partial ordering.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In general, however, for any fragment, task-oriented or otherwise, this is not necessary.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
It is essential to notice that the intentional structure is neither identical to nor isomorphic to a general plan for removing the flywheel.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
It is not identical because a plan encompasses more than a collection of intentions and relationships between them (compare Pollack's (1986) critique of Al planning formalisms as the basis for inferring intentions in discourse).,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
It is not isomorphic because the intentional structure has a different substructure from the general plan for removing the flywheel.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In addition to the intentions arising from steps in the plan, the intentional structure typically contains DSPs corresponding to intentions generated by the particular execution of the task and the dialogue.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, the general plan for the disassembly of a flywheel includes subplans for loosening the setscrews and pulling off the wheel; it might also include subplans (of the loosening step) for finding the setscrews, finding a tool with which to loosen the screws, and loosening each screw individually.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"However, this plan would not contain contingency subplans for what to do when one cannot find the screws or realizes that the available tool is unsatisfactory.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
Intentions 12 and 13 stem from difficulties encountered in locating and loosening the setscrews.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, the intentional structure for this fragment is not isomorphic to the general plan for removing the flywheel.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
Utterance (18) offers another example of the difference between the intentional structure and a general plan for the task.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
This utterance is part of DS4 — not just part of DS1 — even though it contains references to more than one single part of the overall task (which is what Ii is about).,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"It functions to establish a new DSP, 14, as most salient.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Rather than being regarded as a report on the overall status of the task, the first clause is best seen as modifying the DSP.8 With it, the apprentice tells the expert that the trouble in removing the wheel is not with the screws.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, although general task knowledge is used in determining the intentional structure, it is not identical to it.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"In this dialogue, there are fewer instances in which cue phrases are employed to indicate segment boundaries than occur in the movies essay.","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The primary example is the use of first in (1) to mark the start of the segment and to indicate that its DSP is the first of several intentions whose satisfaction will contribute to satisfying the larger discourse of which they are a part.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
The dialogue includes a clear example of the influence of discourse structure on referring expressions.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
"The phrase the screw in the center is used in (25) to refer to the center screw of the wheelpuller, not one of the two setscrews mentioned in (18).","{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"
This use of the phrase is possible because of the attentional state of the discourse structure at the time the phrase is uttered.,"{'title': '3 Two EXAMPLES', 'number': '5'}"

"The information available to the OCP for recognizing that an utterance starts a new segment includes any explicit linguistic cues contained in the utterance (see Section 69) as well as the relationship between its utterance-level intentions and the active DSPs (i.e., those in some focus space that is still on the stack).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Likewise, the fact that an utterance ends a segment may be indicated explicitly by linguistic cues or implicitly from its utterance-level intentions and their relationship to elements of the intentional structure.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"If neither of these is the case, the utterance is part of the current segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Thus, intention recognition and focus space management play key roles in processing.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Moreover, they are also related: the intentional structure is a primary factor in determining focus space changes, and the focus space structure helps constrain the intention recognition process.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The recognition of DP/DSPs is the central issue in the computational modeling of intentional structure.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"If, as we have claimed, for the discourse to be coherent and comprehensible, the OCP must be able to recognize both the DP/DSPsl° and relationships (dominance and satisfaction-precedence) between them, then the question of how the OCP does so is a crucial issue.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"For the discourse as a whole, as well as for each of its segments, the OCP must identify both the intention that serves as the discourse segment purpose and its relationship to other discourse-level intentions.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"In particular, the OCP must be able to recognize which other DSPs that specific intention dominates and is dominated by, and, where relevant, with which other DSPs it has satisfaction-precedence relationships.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Two issues that are central to the recognition problem are what information the OCP can utilize in effecting the recognition and at what point in the discourse that information becomes available.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"An adequate computational model of the recognition process depends critically on an adequate theory of intention and action; this, of course, is a large research problem in itself and one not restricted to matters of discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The need to use such a model for discourse, however, adds certain constraints on the adequacy of any theory or model.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Pollack (1986) describes several properties such theories and models must possess if they are to be adequate for supporting recognition of intention in single-utterance queries; she shows how current Al planning models are inadequate and proposes an alternative planning formalism.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The need to enable recognition of discourse-level intentions leads to yet another set of requirements.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"As will become clear in what follows, the information available to the OCP comes from a variety of sources.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Each of these can typically provide partial information about the DSPs and their relationships.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"These sources are each partially constraining, but only in their ensemble do they constrain in full.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"To the extent that more information is furnished by any one source, commensurately less is needed from the others.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The overall processing model must be one of constraint satisfaction that can operate on partial information.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
It must allow for incrementally constraining the range of possibilities on the basis of new information that becomes available as the segment progresses.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"At least three different kinds of information play a role in the determination of the DSP: specific linguistic markers, utterance-level intentions, and general knowledge about actions and objects in the domain of discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Each plays a part in the OCP's recognition of the DSP and can be utilized by the ICP to facilitate this recognition.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Cue phrases are the most distinguished linguistic means that speakers have for indicating discourse segment boundaries and conveying information about the DSP.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Recent evidence by Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) suggests that certain intonational properties of utterances also provide partial information about the DSP relationships.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Because some cue phrases may be used as clausal connectors, there is a need to distinguish their discourse use from their use in conveying propositional content at the utterance level.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, the word but functions as a boundary marker in utterance (7) of the discourse in Section 3.1, but it can also be used solely (as in the current utterance) to convey propositional content (e.g., the conjunction of two propositions) and serve to connect two clauses within a segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"As discussed in Section 6, cue phrases can provide information about dominance and satisfaction-precedence relationships between segments' DSPs.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"However, they may not completely specify which DSP dominates or satisfaction-precedes the DSP of the segment they start.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Furthermore, cue phrases that explicitly convey information only about the attentional structure (see Section 6) may be ambiguous about the state to which attention is to shift.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, if there have been several interruptions (see Section 5), the phrase but anyway indicates a return to some previously interrupted discourse, but does not specify which one.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Although cue phrases do not completely specify a DSP, the information they provide is useful in limiting the options to be considered.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The second kind of information the OCP has available is the utterance-level intention of each utterance in the discourse.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"As the discussion of the movies example (Section 3.1) pointed out, the DSP may be identical to the utterance-level intention of some utterance in the segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Alternatively, the DSP may combine the intentions of several utterances, as is illustrated in the following discourse segment: I want you to arrange a trip for me to Palo Alto.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
It will be for two weeks.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
I only fly on TWA.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The DSP for this segment is, roughly, that the ICP intends for the OCP to make (complete) trip arrangements for the ICP to go to Palo Alto for two weeks, under the constraint that any flights be on TWA.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The Gricean intentions for these three utterances are as follows: Utterance I: ICP intends that OCP believe that ICP intends that OCP intend to make trip plans for ICP to go to Palo Alto Utterance2: ICP intends that OCP believe that ICP intends OCP to believe that the trip will last two weeks Utterance3: ICP intends that OCP believe that ICP intends OCP to believe that ICP flies only on TWA These intentions must be combined in some way to produce the DSP.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The process is quite complex, since the OCP must recognize that the reason for utterances 2 and 3 is not simply to have some new beliefs about the ICP, but to use those beliefs in arranging the trip.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"While this example fits the schema of a request followed by two informings, schemata will not suffice to represent the behavior as a general rule.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
A different sequence of utterances with different utterance-level intentions can have the same DSP; this is the case in the following segment: It is possible for a sequence that consists of a request followed by two informings not to result in a modification of the trip plans.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, in the following sequence the third utterance results in changing the way the arrangements are made, rather than constraining the nature of the arrangements themselves.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
I want you to arrange a two-week trip for me to Palo Alto.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
I fly only on TWA.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The rates go up tomorrow, so you'll want to call today.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Not only is the contribution of utterance-level intentions to DSPs complicated, but in some instances the DSP for a segment may both constrain and be partially determined by the Gricean intention for some utterance in the segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, the Gricean-intention for utterance (15) in the movies example (Section 3.1) is derived from a combination of facts about the utterance itself, and from its place in the discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"On the surface, (15) appears to be a question addressed to the OCP; its intention would be roughly that the ICP intends the OCP to believe that the ICP wants to know how young people, etc.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"But (15) is actually a rhetorical question and has a very different intention associated with it — namely, that the ICP intends the OCP to believe proposition P2 (namely, that young people cannot drink in through their eyes a continuous spectacle of intense and strained activity without harniful effects).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"In this example, this particular intention is also the primary component of the DSP.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The third kind of information that plays a role in determining the DP/DSPs is shared knowledge about actions and objects in the domain of discourse.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
This shared knowledge is especially important when the linguistic markers and utterance-level intentions are insufficient for determining the DSP precisely.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"In Section 7 we introduce two relations, a supports relation between propositions and a generates relation between actions, and present two rules stating equivalences; one links a dominance relation between two DSPs with a supports relation between propositions and the other links a dominance relation between DSPs to a generates relation between actions.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Use of these rules in one direction allows for (partially) determining what supports or generates relationship holds from the dominance relationship.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"But the rules can be used in the opposite direction also: if, from the content of utterances and reasoning about the domain of discourse, a supports or generates relationship can be determined, then the dominates relationship between DSPs can be determined.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
In such cases it is important to derive the dominance relationship so that the appropriate intentional and attentional structures are available for processing or determining the interpretation of the subsequent discourse.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"From the perspective of recognition, a trade-off implicit in the two equivalences is important.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"If the ICP makes the dominance relationship between two DSPs explicit (e.g., with cue phrases), then the OCP can use this information to help recognize the (ICP's beliefs about the) supports relationship.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Conversely, if the ICP's utterances make clear the (ICP's beliefs about the) supports or generates relationship, then the OCP can use this information to help recognize the dominance relationship.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Although it is most helpful to use the dominance relationships to constrain the search for appropriate supports and generates relationships, sometimes these latter relationships can be inferred reasonably directly from the utterances in a• segment using general knowledge about the objects and actions in the domain of discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
It remains an open question what inferences are needed and how complex it will be to compute supports and generates relationships if the dominance relationship is not directly indicated in a discourse.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Utterances from the movies essay illustrate this tradeoff.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"In utterance (9), the phrase in the first place expresses the dominance relationship between DSPs of the new segment DS5 and the parent segment DS4 directly.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Because of the dominance relationship (as well as the intentions expressed in the utterances), the OCP can determine that the ICP believes that the proposition that the content of the plays is not the best provides support for the proposition that the result of indiscriminate movie going is harmful.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Hence determining dominance yields the support relation.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The support relation can also yield dominance.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Utterances (12)-(14), which comprise DS7, are not explicitly marked for a dominance relation.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"It can be inferred from the fact that the propositions in (12)-(14) provide support for the proposition embedded in DSP6 (that is, that the stories in movies are exciting and over-emotional) that DSP6 dominates DSP7.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Finally, the more information an ICP supplies explicitly in the actual utterances of a discourse, the less reasoning about domain information an OCP has to do to achieve recognition.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Cohen (1983) has made a similar claim regarding the problem of recognizing the relationship between one proposition and another.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"As discussed in Section 2.2, the intentional structure evolves as the discourse does.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"By the same token, the discourse participants' mental-state correlates of the intentional structure are not prebuilt; neither participant may have a complete model of the intentional structure &quot;in mind&quot; until the discourse is completed.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The dominance relationships that actually shape the intentional structure cannot be known a priori, because the specific intentions that will come into play are not known (never by the OCP, hardly ever by the ICP) until the utterances in the discourse have been made.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Although it is assumed that the participants' common knowledge includes&quot; enough information about the domain to determine various relationships such as supports and generates, it is not assumed that, prior to a discourse, they actually had inferred and are aware of all the relationships they will need for that discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Because any of the utterances in a segment may contribute information relevant to a complete determination of the DSP, the recognition process is not complete until the end of the segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"However, the OCP must be able to recognize at least a generalization of the DSP so that he can make the proper moves with respect to the attentional structure.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"That is, some combination of explicit indicators and intentional and propositional content must allow the OCP to ascertain where the DSP will fit in the intentional structure at the beginning of a segment, even if the specific intention that is the DSP cannot be determined until the end of the segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Utterance (15) in the movies example illustrates this point.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The author writes, &quot;How can our young people drink in through their eyes a continuous spectacle of intense and strained activity and feeling without harmful effects?&quot; The primary intention 12 is derived from this utterance, but this cannot be done until very late in the discourse segment [since (15) occurs at the end of DS2].","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Furthermore, the segment for which 12 is primary has complex embedding of other segments.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Utterance (16), intention IO, and DSO constitute another example of the expression of a primary intention late in a discourse segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"In that case, 10 cannot be computed until (16) has been read, and (16) is not only the last utterance in DSO, but is one that covers the entire essay.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"If an OCP must recognize a DSP to understand a segment, then we ask: how does the OCP recognize a DSP when the utterance from which its primary intention is derived comes so late in the segment?","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"We conjecture with regard to such segments as D2 of the movies essay that the primary intention (e.g., 12) may be determined partially (and hence a generalized version become recognizable) before the point at which it is actually expressed in the discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"While the DP/DSP may not be expressed early, there is still partial information about it.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
This partial information often suffices to establish dominance (or satisfaction-precedence) relationships for additional segments.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"As these latter are placed in the hierarchy, their DSPs can provide further partial information for the underspecified DSP.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, even though the intention 10 is expressed directly only in the last utterance of the movies essay, utterance (4) expresses an intention to know whether p or —p is true (i.e., whether or not parents should let children see movies often and without close monitoring).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"10 is an intention to believe, whose proposition is a generalization of the —p expressed in (4).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Consider also the primary intention 14.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"It occurs in a segment embedded within DS2, is more general than 12, but is an approximation to it.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"It would not be surprising to discover that OCPs can in fact predict something close to 12 on the basis of 14, utterances (9)-(14), and the partial dominance hierarchy available at each point in the discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The focus space structure enables certain processing decisions to be made locally.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"In particular, it limits the information that must be considered in recognizing the DSP as well as that considered in identifying the referents of certain classes of definite noun phrases.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
A primary role of the focus space stack is to constrain the range of DSPs considered as candidates for domination or satisfaction-precedence of the DSP of the current segment.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Only those DSPs in some space on the focusing stack are viable prospects.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"As a result of this use of the focusing structure, the theory predicts that this decision will be a local one with respect to attentional state.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Because two focus spaces may be close to each other in the attentional structure without the discourse segments they arise from necessarily being close to one another and vice versa, this prediction corresponds to a claim that locality in the focusing structure is what matters to determination of the intentional structure.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
A second role of the focusing structure is to constrain the OCP's search for possible referents of definite noun phrases and pronouns.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"To illustrate this role, we will consider the phrase the screw in the center in utterance (25) of the task-oriented dialogue of Section 3.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The focus stack configuration when utterance (25) is spoken is shown in Figure 7.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The stack contains (in bottom-totop order) focus spaces FS1, FS4, and FS5 for segments DS1, DS4, and DS5, respectively.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"For DS5 the wheelpuller is a focused entity, while for D54 the two setscrews are (because they are explicitly mentioned).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The entities in FS5 are considered before those in FS4 as potential referents.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"The wheelpuller has three screws: two small screws fasten the side arms, and a large screw in the center is the main functioning part.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"As a result, this large screw is implicitly in focus in FS5 (Grosz 1977) and thus identified as the referent without the two setscrews ever being considered.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Attentional state also constrains the search for referents of pronouns.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Because pronouns contain less explicit information about their referents than definite descriptions, additional mechanisms are needed to account for what may and may not be pronominalized in the discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"One such mechanism is centering (which we previously called immediate focusing; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Sidner 1979).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Centering, like focusing, is a dynamic behavior, but is a more local phenomenon.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"In brief, a backward-looking center is associated with each utterance in a discourse segment; of all the focused elements the backward-looking center is the one that is central in that utterance (i.e., the uttering of the particular sequence of words at that point in the discourse).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"A combination of syntactic, semantic, and discourse information is used to identify the backward-looking center.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The fact that some entity is the backward-looking center is used to constrain the search for the referent of a pronoun in a subsequent utterance.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Note that unlike the DSP, which is constant for a segment, the backward-looking center may shift: different entities may become more salient at different points in the segment.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
The presence of both centers and DSPs in this theory leads us to an intriguing conjecture: that &quot;topic&quot; is a concept that is used ambiguously for both the DSP of a segment and the center.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
In the literature the concept of &quot;topic&quot; has appeared in many guises.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
In syntactic form it is used to describe the preposing of syntactic constituents in English and the &quot;wa&quot; marking in Japanese.,"{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"Researchers have used it to describe the sentence topic (i.e., what the sentence is about; Firbas 1971, Sgall, Haji6ova, and Benesova 1973), and as a pragmatic notion (Reinhart 1981); others want to use the term for discourse topic, either to mean what the discourse is about, or to be defined as those proposition(s) the ICP provides or requests new information about (see Reinhart (1981) for a review of many of the notions of aboutness and topic).","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
"It appears that many of the descriptions of sentence topic correspond (though not always) to centers, while discourse topic corresponds to the DSP of a segment or of the discourse.","{'title': '4 PROCESSING ISSUES', 'number': '6'}"
Interruptions in discourses pose an important test of any theory of discourse structure.,"{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"

"The importance of distinguishing between intentional structure and attentional state is evident in the three examples considered in Subsections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.","{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"
The distinction also permits us to explain a type of behavior deemed by others to be similar — so-called semantic returns — an issue we examine in Subsection 5.5.,"{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"

"From an intuitive view, we observe that interruptions are pieces of discourse that break the flow of the preceding discourse.","{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"

"The strong definition holds for those interruptions we classify as &quot;true interruptions&quot; and digressions, while the weaker form holds for those that are flashbacks.","{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"

Weak definition: An interruption is a discourse segment whose DSP is not dominated nor satisfaction-preceded by the DSP of the immediately preceding segment.,"{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"
Neither of the above definitions includes an explicit mention of our intuition that there is a &quot;return&quot; to the interrupted discourse after an interruption.,"{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"

"If we assume a focus space is normally popped from the focus stack if and only if a speaker has satisfied the DSP of its corresponding segment, then it naturally follows both that the focus space for the interruption will be popped after the interruption, and that the focus space for the interrupted segment will be at the top of the stack because its DSP is yet to be satisfied.","{'title': '5 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: INTERRUPTIONS', 'number': '7'}"

One linguistic indicator in this example is the change of mood from imperative.,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
Indicators that the stop that utterance is an interruption include the change to imperative mood and the use of the vocative (Polanyi and Scha 1983).,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
Two other indicators may be assumed to have been present at the time of the discourse — a change of intonation (imagine a slightly shrill tone of command with an undercurrent of annoyance) and a shift of gaze (toward and then away from the kids).,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
"It is also possible that the type of pause present in such cases is evidence of the interruption, but further research is needed to establish whether this is indeed the case.","{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"

"Instead, the intuition that readers have of an embedding in the discourse structure is captured in the attentional state by the stacking of focus spaces.","{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"

"Sometimes an ICP interrupts the flow of discussion because some purposes, propositions, or objects need to be brought into the discourse but have not been: the ICP forgot to include those entities first, and so must now go back and fill in the missing information.","{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
A flashback segment occurs at that point in the discourse.,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
The flashback is defined as a segment whose DSP satisfaction-precedes the interrupted segment and is dominated by some other segment's DSP.,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
"Hence, it is a specialization of the weak definition of interruptions.","{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
This type of interruption differs from true interruptions both intentionally and linguistically: the DSP for the flashback bears some relationship to the DP for the whole discourse.,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"

The ICP in this instance does not realize this constraint until after he begins.,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"

The following three relationships hold between the different DSPs:14,"{'title': 'DISCOURCE SEGMENTS FOCUS SPACE STACK DOMINANCE HIERARCHY', 'number': '8'}"
"This kind of interruption is distinct from a true interruption because there is a connection, although indirect, between the DSPs for the two segments.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"Furthermore, the linguistic features of the start of the interruption signify that there is a precedence relation between these DSPs (and hence that the correction is necessary).","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
Flashbacks are also distinct from normally embedded discourses because of the precedence relationship between the DSPs for the two segments and the order in which the segments occur.,"{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"The available linguistic data permit three possible attentional states as appropriate models for flashbacktype interruptions: one is identical to the state that would ensue if the flashback segment were a normally embedded segment, the second resembles the model of a true interruption, and the third differs from the others by requiring an auxiliary stack.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"

"In the example in the figure, entities in the spaces from FSA to FSB are accessible as well (though less salient than) those in space FSABc.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"Evidence for this kind of stack behavior could come from discourses in which phrases in the segment about ABC could refer to entities represented in FSB, but not to those in FSBill or FSc.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"After an explicit indication that there is a return to DSPBili (e.g., the Now back to Bill used in this example), any focus spaces left on the stack from the flashback are popped off, and all spaces on the auxiliary stack (including FSBill) are returned to the main stack.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"Note, however, that this model does not preclude the possibility of a return to some space between FSA and FSB before popping the auxiliary stack.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
Whether there are discourses that include such a return and are deemed coherent is an open question.,"{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
The auxiliary stack model differs from the other two models by the references permitted and by the spaces that can be popped to.,"{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"Given the initial configuration in Figure 9, if the segment with DSPABc were normally embedded, FSABc would just be added to the top of the stack.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"

The auxiliary stack model is obviously more complicated than the other two alternatives.,"{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
Whether it (or some equivalent alternative) is necessary depends on facts of discourse behavior that have not yet been determined.,"{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"The third type of interruption, which we call a digression, is defined as a strong interruption that contains a reference to some entity that is salient in both the interruption and the interrupted segment.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"For example, if while discussing Bill's role in company ABC, one conversational participant interrupts with, Speaking of Bill, that reminds me, he came to dinner last week, Bill remains salient, but the DP changes.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"Digressions commonly begin with phrases such as speaking of John or that reminds me, although no cue phrase need be present, and that reminds me may also signal other stack and intention shifts.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"

"A new focus space is formed and pushed onto the stack, but it contains at least one — and possibly other — entities from the interrupted segment's focus space.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"Like the flashback-type interruption, the digression must usually be closed with an explicit utterance such as getting back to ABC... or anyway.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
One case of discourse behavior that we must distinguish comprises the so-called &quot;semantic returns&quot; observed by Reichman (1981) and discussed by Polanyi and Scha (1983).,"{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"In all the interruptions we have considered so far, the stack must be popped when the interruption is over and the interrupted discourse is resumed.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"

"There need not be any discourse underway when a semantic return occurs; in such cases, the focus stack will be empty.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"Thus, unlike the returns that follow normal interruptions, semantic returns involve a push onto the stack of a new space containing, among other things, representations of the reintroduced entities.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"The separation of attentional state from intentional structure makes clear not only what is occurring in such cases, but also the intuitions underlying the term semantic return.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"In reintroducing some entities from a previous discourse, conversational participants are establishing some connection between the DSP of the new segment and the intentional structure of the original discourse.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"
"It is not a return to a previous focus space because the focus space for the original discourse is gone from the stack, and the items to be referred to must be re-established explicitly.","{'title': 'DSPABC SP DSPBBI', 'number': '9'}"

"First, consider what happens when the ICP shifts to a new DSP, B, that is dominated by A (and correspondingly by X).","{'title': '6 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: CUE WORDS', 'number': '10'}"

"In addition, the change in DSP results in a change in the focus stack.","{'title': '6 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: CUE WORDS', 'number': '10'}"

"The space containing A is salient, but less so than the space with B.","{'title': '6 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: CUE WORDS', 'number': '10'}"
"Cue phrase(s) to signal this case, and only this one, must communicate two pieces of information: that there is a change to some new purpose (resulting in a new focus space being created in the attentional state model rather than a return to one on the stack) and that the new purpose (DSP B) is dominated by DSP A.","{'title': '6 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: CUE WORDS', 'number': '10'}"
"Typical cue phrases for this kind of change are for example and to wit, and sometimes first and second.","{'title': '6 APPLICATION OF THE THEORY: CUE WORDS', 'number': '10'}"

"To clarify these relationships, consider an analogous situation with nonlinguistic actions.18 An action may divide into several subactions; for example, the planting of a rose bush divides into preparing the soil, digging a hole, placing the rose bush in the hole, filling the rest of the hole with soil, and watering the ground around the bush.","{'title': '7 SOME PROPERTIES AND PROBLEMS OF DISCOURSE-LEVEL INTENTIONS', 'number': '12'}"

"The OCP is not intended to believe that the q; imply p, but rather to believe that the q, in conjunction with other facts and rules that the ICP assumes the OCP has available or can obtain and thus come to believe are sufficient for the OCP to conclude p. Fourth, the DP/DSP may only be completely determined at the end of the discourse (segment), as we discussed in Section 4.","{'title': 'Vi=1,...,n Intend(ICP, Believe(OCP,p) A Believe(OCP,qi) A', 'number': '13'}"

"Hence, for the purpose of recognizing the discourse structure, it would be sufficient for the third clause to be Believe(OCP, Believe(ICP, Supports (p, q,A...Aqn))) However, the DP of a belief-case discourse is not merely to get the OCP to believe p, but to get the OCP to believe p by virtue of believing the qi.","{'title': 'Vi=1,...,n Intend(ICP, Believe(OCP,p) A Believe(OCP,qi) A', 'number': '13'}"

"There is an important relationship between the supports relation and the dominance relation that can hold between DP/DSPs; it is captured in the following rule (using the same notation as above): The implication in the forward direction states that if a conversational participant (CPi) believes that the proposition p is supported by the proposition qi, and he intends another participant (CP2) to adopt these beliefs, then his intention that CP2 believe p dominates his intention that CP2 believe qi.","{'title': 'Vi=1,...,n Intend(ICP, Believe(OCP,p) A Believe(OCP,qi) A', 'number': '13'}"
