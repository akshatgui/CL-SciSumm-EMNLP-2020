Two types of expressions have previously been described in these terms: definite pronouns and certain definite noun phrases (NPs).,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Researchers in computational linguistics and in artificial intelligence have called these expressions anaphors (cf., Woods 1978, Sidner 1983, Bobrow 1977, Hirst 1981, Webber 1983).","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Linguists, however, have used this term somewhat differently.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Many have restricted its use to expressions (usually pronouns) that can be treated analogously to variables in a logical language (Chomsky 1980).,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"A view in linguistics that comes somewhat closer to the Al model can be found in a paper by Sag and Hankamer (1984), who distinguish what they call deep (or modelinterpretive) anaphora from what they call surface anaphora (or ellipsis).","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Under the former, they include personal pronouns, sentential &quot;it,&quot; and null-complement anaphora, and under the latter, verb phrase (VP) ellipsis, sluicing, gapping, and stripping.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"The two types are distinguished by whether they make reference to the interpretation of an antecedent—i.e., some object in a model of the world constructed by the interpreter of the sentence of discourse (deep anaphora)—or whether they are interpreted with respect to a previous logical form (surface anaphora).","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"While their deep anaphors include pronouns, Hankamer and Sag do not consider other expressions like NPs in discourse that might also be described in similar model-interpretive terms, nor do they describe in any detail how model interpretation works for the expressions they consider.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"To avoid confusion then, I will use the term discourse anaphors for expressions that have these two properties.'","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"My main point will be that tensed clauses share these properties as well, and hence should also be considered discourse anaphors.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"This will capture in a simple way the oft-stated, but difficult-to-prove intuition that tense is anaphoric.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"To begin with, in Section 2, I characterize the dependency of an anaphoric expression Xb on a discourse entity Ea in terms of an anaphoric function a(Xb,Ea), that itself depends on 1. the ontology of the specified entity Ea and 2. discourse structure and its focusing effect on which Ea entities the listener is attending to.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"With respect to definite pronouns and NPs, this will essentially be a review of previous research.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"However, I will argue that some indefinite NPs should also be considered discourse anaphors in just this same way.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 3, I will move on to tensed clauses and the notion of tense as anaphor, a notion that goes back to at least Leech in his monograph Meaning and the English Verb (1987).","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"I will review previous attempts to make the notion precise, attempts that require special-purpose machinery to get them to work.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"Then I will show, in contrast, that the notion can more simply be made precise in terms of a set of similar anaphoric functions that again depend on ontology and discourse structure.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
Making clear these dependencies contributes to our knowledge of what is needed for understanding narrative text.,"{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"The notion specify that I am using in my definition of discourse anaphora is based on the notion of a Discourse Model, earlier described in Webber (1983).","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"My basic premise is that in processing a narrative text, a listener is developing a model of at least two things: 1. the entities under discussion, along with their properties and relationships to one another, and 2. the events and situations under discussion, along with their relationships to one another (e.g., consequential relations, simple ordering relations, elaboration relations, etc.).","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
The representation as a whole I call the listener's Discourse Model.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"2 In this section, I will focus on NPs.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"(In Section 3, I will turn attention to tensed clauses.)","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"NPs may evoke entities into the listener's Discourse Model corresponding to individuals (Example 1), sets (Example 2), abstract individuals (Example 3), classes (Example 4), etc .","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
3 An NP which evokes a discourse entity also specifies it.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
One way an NP would be considered anaphoric by the above definition would be if it specified an entity Ea in the model that had already been evoked by some other NP.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"(In that case, one would say that the two NPs co-specified the same entity.)","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"This basic arrangement is illustrated in Examples 1-3 above and is shown in Figure la.5 Formally, one could say that there is an anaphoric function a, whose value, given the anaphoric noun phrase NPb and the discourse entity Ea, is Ea thatis, a(NPb,Ea) = Ea.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
This can also be read as NPb specifies Ea by virtue of Ea.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
Definite pronouns are most often anaphoric in just this way.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"The other way an NP would be considered a discourse anaphor would be if it used some existing discourse entity Ea to evoke and specify a new discourse entity Eb, as in where NPb—the driver—makes use of the entity associated with the bus mentioned in 5a to specify a new entity—the driver of that bus.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Here the anaphoric function is of the form a(NPb,Ea) = Eb.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In cooperative discourse, there have to be constraints on the value of a(NPb,Ea), since only NPb is given explicitly.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In short, a cooperative speaker must be able to assume that the listener is able to both infer a possible a and single out Ea in his/her evolving Discourse Mode1.6 (This is illustrated in Figure lb.)","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
I will consider each of these two types of constraints in turn.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Speakers assume listeners will have no problem with a when a(NPb,Ea) = Ea.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Inferring a in other cases follows in large part from the ontology of the entities specified by NPs—i.e., the ontology of our concepts of individuals, sets, mass terms, generics, etc.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"We view these as having parts (e.g., car: the engine, the wheels), having functional relations (e.g., car: the driver), having roles (e.g., wedding: the bride), etc.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"These needn't be necessary parts, relations, roles, etc.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Our ontology includes possible parts, relations, etc., and these too make it possible for the listener to infer an a such that a(NPb,Ea) = Eb (e.g., room: the chandelier; car: the chauffeur; wedding: the flower girl).","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Such inferences are discussed at length in the literature, including Clark and Marshall 1981, and Hobbs 1987.7 Before closing this section, there are two more things to say about NPs.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"First, the above definition of discourse anaphor does not apply to all definite NPs: a definite NP can be used to refer to something unique in the speaker and listener's shared spatio-temporal context (e.g., the telephone—i.e., the one that they both hear ringing) or their shared culture (e.g., the government), to the unique representative of a class (e.g., the duck-billed platypus), to an entire class or set (e.g., the stars), or to a functionally defined entity (e.g., the largest tomato in Scotland).","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
None of these would be considered discourse anaphoric by the above definition.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Secondly, though the definition implies that one must consider some indefinite NPs to be discourse anaphors, since they are essentially parasitic on a corresponding anaphoric definite NP, as in the following example: b.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
The driver stopped the bus when the passengers began to sing &quot;Aida&quot;.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"The indefinite NP a passenger in (6a) can be paraphrased as some one of the passengers, and thus is parasitic on the anaphoric definite NP the passengers mentioned explicitly in (6b).","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
This does not imply that all indefinite NPs are discourse anaphors.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In Mary met a boy with green hair or Fred built an oak desk, the indefinite NPs do not need to be interpreted with respect to another discourse entity and some inferrable relationship with that entity, in order to characterize the discourse entity they specify.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In the next section, I will discuss the second kind of constraint on the function a(NPb,Ea) necessary for cooperative use of an anaphor—constraints on identifiable Eas.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
These involve notions of discourse structure and discourse focus.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Before I close, though, I want to point to where I'm going vis-a-vis the anaphoric character of tense and tensed clauses.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In contrast with previous accounts of tense as pronoun or tense as loosely context-dependent, I am going to claim that, like an anaphoric definite NP, The ideas presented in this section have been formulated and developed by Barbara Grosz and Candy Sidner, originally independently and later in joint research.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"It is not a summary of their work:8 it is limited to those of their ideas that are necessary to the concept of anaphor that I am advancing here and the concept of tense as anaphor, in particular.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Sidner's thesis (1979, 1983) presents an account of understanding definite pronouns and anaphoric definite NPs that reflects the ease with which people identify the intended specificand of definite pronouns (except in highly ambiguous cases), as well as the intended specificand of anaphoric definite NPs.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"With respect to noun phrases (but not clauses), Sidner makes the same assumption about evoking, specifying, and co-specifying in a Discourse Model that I have made here.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"To understand anaphoric expressions, Sidner postulates three mechanisms: The DF corresponds to that entity the listener is most attending to.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Pronouns can most easily specify the current DF, slightly less easily a member of the PFL, and with slightly more difficulty, a stacked focus.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Specifying an entity pronominally can shift the listener's attention to it, thereby promoting it to be the next DF.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Anything else specified in the clause ends up on the PFL, ordered by its original syntactic position.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"(Sidner introduced a separate &quot;agent focus&quot; to allow two entities to be specified pronominally in the same clause, but it was not a critical feature of her approach.)","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"As for anaphoric definite NPs, they can specify anything previously introduced (whether on the PFL, a stacked focus, or anything else) or anything related in a mutually inferrable way with the current DF or a member of the PFL.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In terms of the constraints I mentioned above, it is only those discourse entities that are either the DF or on the PFL that can serve as Ea for an anaphoric definite NP.9 In Sidner (1983) DFs always are stacked for possible resumption later.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In Grosz and Sidner (1986) it is an entire focus space (FS) (Grosz 1977) that gets stacked (i.e., the collection of entities L is attending to by virtue of the current discourse segment (DS)) but only when the 9purpose of the current DS is taken to dominate that of the one upcoming.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
Dominance relations are also specified further according to the type of discourse.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In Grosz and Sidner, they are defined for task-related dialogues and arguments.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, in arguments, one DS purpose (DSP) dominates another if the second provides evidence for a point made in the first.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"When the dominated DSP is satisfied, its corresponding FS is popped.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
This stack mechanism models the listener's attentional state.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
The relations between DSPs constitute the intentional structure of the text.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
Getting a listener to resume a DS via the stack mechanism is taken to require less effort on a speaker's part than returning to elaborate an argument or subtask description later on.,"{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"The significance of Sidner (1983) and Grosz and Sidner (1986) for the current enterprise is that: Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 63 Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor I reinterpret this in the current framework in terms of the anaphoric function a(NPb,Ea).","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Within a discourse segment, the entity that is the DF is the most likely Ea.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"Over the discourse segment, other discourse entities in the segment's focus space may in turn become DF.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"With a change in discourse segment, however, the DF can change radically to an entity in the focus space associated with the new segment.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"To hint again at what is to come: in Section 3.2, I will propose a temporal analogue of DF, which I have called temporal focus (TF).","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
"In Section 3.3, I will show how gradual movements of the TF are tied in with the ontology of what a tensed clause specifies—i.e., an ontology of events and situations—while more radical movements reflect the effect of discourse structure on TF.","{'title': '2 BACKGROUND', 'number': '3'}"
Tense may not seem prima facie anaphoric: an isolated sentence like John went to bed or I met a man who looked like a basset hound appears to make sense in a way that a stand-alone He went to bed or The man went to bed does not.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"On the other hand, if some time or event is established by the context (i.e., either by an event or situation described in the previous discourse or by a temporal adverbial in the current sentence—cf.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Passonneau, and Moens and Steedman, this volume), tense will invariably be interpreted with respect to it, as in: In each case, the interpretation of John's going to bed is linked to an explicitly mentioned time or event.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
This is what underlies all discussion of the anaphoric quality of tense.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"The assumption that tense is anaphoric (i.e., that its interpretation is linked to some time or event derived from context) goes back many years, although it is not a universally held belief (cf.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
Comrie 1985).,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Leech seems to express this view in his Meaning and the English Verb: 63 INDEFINITE TIME Whereas the Present Perfect, in its indefinite past sense, does not name a specific point of time, a definite POINT OF ORIENTATION in the past is normally required for the appropriate use of the Simple Past Tense.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"The point of orientation may be specified in one of three ways: (a) by an adverbial express of timewhen; (b) by a preceding use of a Past or Perfect Tense; and (c) by implicit definition; i.e., by assumption of a particular time from context.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"73 The Past Perfect Tense has the meaning of pastin-the-past, or more accurately, 'a time further in the past, seen from the viewpoint of a definite point of time already in the past'.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"That is, like the Simple Past Tense, the Past Perfect demands an already established past point of reference.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"(Leech: 47) Leech did not elaborate further on how reference points are used in the interpretation of simple past tense and past perfect tense, or on what has become the main problem in the semantics and pragmatics of tense: reconciling the (usual) forward movement of events in narratives with a belief in the anaphoric (or contextdependent) character of tense.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"The first explicit reference I have to tense being anaphoric like a definite pronoun is in an article by McCawley (1971:110), who said: However the tense morpheme does not just express the time relationship between the clause it is in and the next higher clause—it also refers to the time of the clause that it is in, and indeed, refers to it in a way that is rather like the way in which personal pronouns refer to what they stand for.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
McCawley also tried to fit in his view of tense as pronoun with the interpretation of tense in simple narratives.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Here he proposed that the event described in one clause serves as the antecedent of the event described in the next, but that it may be related to that event by being either at the same time or &quot;shortly after&quot; it.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
He did not elaborate on when one relation would be assumed and when the other.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
Partee (1973) also noted the similarities between tense and definite pronouns.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"However, she subsequently recognized that taking simple past tense as directly analogous with pronouns was incompatible with the usual forward movement of time in the interpretation in a sequence of sentences denoting events (Partee 1984).","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Her response was a modification of the claim that tense is anaphoric, saying: I still believe it is reasonable to characterize tense as anaphoric, or more broadly as context-dependent, but I would no longer suggest that this requires them to be viewed as 'referring' to times as pronouns 'refer' to entities, or to treat times as arguments of predicates (256).","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"The particular context-dependent process she proposes for interpreting tensed clauses follows that of Hinrichs 1986, briefly described below.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
The examples presented above to illustrate the anaphoric quality of tense were all simple past.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"However, as Leech notes (see above), the past perfect also makes demands on having some reference point already estabBonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor lished in the context.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
Thus it cannot be in terms of the event described in a tensed clause that tense is anaphoric.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Instead, several people (Steedman 1982, Hinrichs 1986, Bauerle 1979) have argued that it is that part of tense called by Reichenbach (1947) the point of reference (here abbreviated RT) that is anaphoric.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
This can be seen by considering the following example: 8. a. John went to the hospital. b.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
He had twisted his ankle on a patch of ice.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
It is not the point of the event (here abbreviated ET) of John's twisting his ankle that is interpreted anaphorically with respect to his going to the hospital.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Rather, it is the RT of the second clause: its ET is interpreted as prior to that because the clause is in the past perfect (see above).","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"I will now review briefly Hinrichs's proposal as to how tensed clauses are interpreted in context, in order to contrast it with the current proposal.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"In Hinrichs 1986, Hinrichs makes the simplifying assumption that in a sequence of simple past sentences, the temporal order of events described cannot contradict the order of the sentences.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
This allows him to focus on the problem of characterizing those circumstances in which the event described by one sentence follows that described by the previous one (Example 9—Hinrichs's Example 15) and when it overlaps it (Example 10— Hinrichs' s Example 21): 9.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"

The brush man was smiling at him hesitantly.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Hinrichs bases his account on the Aktionsart of a tensed clause (i.e., its Vendlerian classification as an accomplishment, achievement, activity, or state—including progressives).","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"Assuming an initial reference point in a discourse, the event described by a tensed clause interpreted as an accomplishment or achievement will be included in that reference point and will also introduce a new reference point ordered after the old one.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
Events associated with the other Aktionsarten include the current reference point in the event time.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"This means that given a sequence of two clauses interpreted as accomplishments or achievements, their corresponding events will follow one another (cf.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
Example 9).,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"On the other hand, given a sequence with at least one tensed clause interpreted as an activity or state (including progressive), their corresponding events will be interpreted as overlapping each other (cf.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
Example 10).,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
Hinrichs relates his reference point to that of Reichenbach.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"(Thus, the anaphoric character of tense is based on RT and not on the events directly.)","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"However, Hinrichs's notion and Reichenbach's differ with respect to the time of the event described in the tensed clause.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"While Reichenbach talks about ET and RT being the same for nonprogressive past-tense clauses, in Hinrichs's account the reference point can fall after the event if a nonprogressive past is interpreted as an accomplishment or an achievement.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
This is necessary to achieve the forward movement of narrative that Hinrichs assumes is always the case (his simplifying assumption) but it is not the same as Reichenbach's RT.,"{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
"It also leads to problems in cases where this simplifying assumption is just wrong—where in a sequence of simple past tenses, there is what appears to be a &quot;backward&quot; movement of time, as in 11. a.","{'title': '3 TENSE AS ANAPHOR', 'number': '4'}"
