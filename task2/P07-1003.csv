Extracting tree transducer rules for syntactic MT systems can be hindered by word alignment errors that violate syntactic correspondences.,{}
"We propose a novel model for unsupervised word alignment which explicitly takes into account target language constituent structure, while retaining the robustness and efficiency of the HMM alignment model.",{}
"Our model’s predictions improve the yield of a tree transducer extraction system, without sacrificing alignment quality.",{}
We also discuss the impact of various posteriorbased methods of reconciling bidirectional alignments.,{}
"Syntactic methods are an increasingly promising approach to statistical machine translation, being both algorithmically appealing (Melamed, 2004; Wu, 1997) and empirically successful (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, despite recent progress, almost all syntactic MT systems, indeed statistical MT systems in general, build upon crude legacy models of word alignment.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This dependence runs deep; for example, Galley et al. (2006) requires word alignments to project trees from the target language to the source, while Chiang (2005) requires alignments to induce grammar rules.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Word alignment models have not stood still in recent years.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"However, few of these methods have explicitly addressed the tension between word alignments and the syntactic processes that employ them (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005; Lopez and Resnik, 2005).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We are particularly motivated by systems like the one described in Galley et al. (2006), which constructs translations using tree-to-string transducer rules.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
These rules are extracted from a bitext annotated with both English (target side) parses and word alignments.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Rules are extracted from target side constituents that can be projected onto contiguous spans of the source sentence via the word alignment.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Constituents that project onto non-contiguous spans of the source sentence do not yield transducer rules themselves, and can only be incorporated into larger transducer rules.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Thus, if the word alignment of a sentence pair does not respect the constituent structure of the target sentence, then the minimal translation units must span large tree fragments, which do not generalize well.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We present and evaluate an unsupervised word alignment model similar in character and computation to the HMM model (Ney and Vogel, 1996), but which incorporates a novel, syntax-aware distortion component which conditions on target language parse trees.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"These trees, while automatically generated and therefore imperfect, are nonetheless (1) a useful source of structural bias and (2) the same trees which constrain future stages of processing anyway.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In our model, the trees do not rule out any alignments, but rather softly influence the probability of transitioning between alignment positions.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In particular, transition probabilities condition upon paths through the target parse tree, allowing the model to prefer distortions which respect the tree structure.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our model generates word alignments that better respect the parse trees upon which they are conditioned, without sacrificing alignment quality.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Using the joint training technique of Liang et al. (2006) to initialize the model parameters, we achieve an AER superior to the GIZA++ implementation of IBM model 4 (Och and Ney, 2003) and a reduction of 56.3% in aligned interior nodes, a measure of agreement between alignments and parses.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The root nodes of such constituents – denoted frontier nodes – serve as the roots and leaves of tree fragments that form minimal transducer rules.,"{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
Frontier nodes are distinguished by their compatibility with the word alignment.,"{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"For a constituent c of t, we consider the set of source words sc that are aligned to c. If none of the source words in the linear closure s* (the words between the leftmost and rightmost members of sc) aligns to a target word outside of c, then the root of c is a frontier node.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"The remaining interior nodes do not generate rules, but can play a secondary role in a translation system.1 The roots of null-aligned constituents are not frontier nodes, but can attach productively to multiple minimal rules.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"Two transducer rules, t1 —* s1 and t2 —* s2, can be combined to form larger translation units by composing t1 and t2 at a shared frontier node and appropriately concatenating s1 and s2.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"However, no technique has yet been shown to robustly extract smaller component rules from a large transducer rule.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, for the purpose of maximizing the coverage of the extracted translation model, we prefer to extract many small, minimal rules and generate larger rules via composition.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"

"While alignment errors are undesirable in general, this error is particularly problematic for a syntax-based translation system.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"In a phrase-based system, this link would block extraction of the phrases [ax´es sur la carri`er ==>. career oriented] and [les emplois ==>. the jobs] because the error overlaps with both.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"However, the intervening phrase [emplois sont ==>. jobs are] would still be extracted, at least capturing the transfer of subject-verb agreement.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
"By contrast, the tree transducer extraction method fails to extract any of these fragments: the alignment error causes all non-terminal nodes in the parse tree to be interior nodes, excluding preterminals and the root.","{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
Figure 1B exposes the consequences: a wide array of desired rules are lost during extraction.,"{'title': '2 Translation with Tree Transducers', 'number': '2'}"
