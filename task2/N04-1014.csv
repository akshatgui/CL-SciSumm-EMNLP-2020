We now build a trainable xRS tree-to-string transducer that embodies the same P(Japanese string  |English tree).,"{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
"First, we need start productions like these, where q is the start state: - q x:S → q.TOP.S x - q x:VP → q.TOP.VP x These set up states like q.TOP.S, which means “translate this tree, whose root is S.” Then every q.parent.child pair gets its own set ofthree insert-function-wordproductions, e.g.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
": - q.TOP.S x → i x, r x - q.TOP.S x → r x, i x - q.TOP.S x → r x - q.NP.NN x → i x, r x - q.NP.NN x → r x, i x - q.NP.NN x → r x State i means “produce a Japanese function word out of thin air.” We include an i production for every Japanese word in the vocabulary, e.g.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
": State r means “re-order my children and then recurse.” For internal nodes, we include a production for every parent/child-sequence and every permutation thereof, e.g.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
": - r NP(x0:CD, x1:NN) → q.NP.CD x0, q.NP.NN x1 - r NP(x0:CD, x1:NN) → q.NP.NN x1, q.NP.CD x0 The rhs sends the child subtrees back to state q for recursive processing.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
"However, for English leaf nodes, we instead transition to a different state t, so as to prohibit any subsequent Japanese function word insertion: - r NN(x0:car) → t x0 State t means “translate this word,” and we have a production for every pair of co-occurring English and Japanese words: - t car → kuruma - t car → wa - t car → *e* This follows (Yamada and Knight, 2001) in also allowing English words to disappear, or translate to epsilon.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
Every production in the xRS transducer has an associated weight and corresponds to exactly one of the model parameters.,"{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
There are several benefits to this xRS formulation.,"{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
"First, it clarifies the model, in the same way that (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Kumar and Byrne, 2003) elucidate other machine translation models in easily-grasped FST terms.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
"Second, the model can be trained with generic, off-the-shelf tools—versus the alternative of working out model-specific re-estimation formulae and implementing custom training software.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
"Third, we can easily extend the model in interesting ways.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
"For example, we can add productions for multi-level and lexical re-ordering: - r NP(x0:NP, PP(IN(of), x1:NP)) → q x1, no, q x0 We can add productions for phrasal translations: - r NP(JJ(big), NN(cars)) → ooki, kuruma This can now include crucial non-constituent phrasal translations: - r S(NP(PRO(there),VP(VB(are), x0:NP) → q x0, ga, arimasu We can also eliminate many epsilon word-translation rules in favor of more syntactically-controlled ones, e.g.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
": - r NP(DT(the),x0:NN) → q x0 We can make many such changes without modifying the training procedure, as long as we stick to tree automata.","{'title': '9 Example', 'number': '11'}"
"Tree substitution grammars or TSG (Schabes, 1990) are equivalent to regular tree grammars. xR transducers are similar to (weighted) Synchronous TSG, except that xR can copy input trees (and transform the copies differently), but does not model deleted input subtrees.","{'title': '10 Related Work', 'number': '12'}"
"(Eisner, 2003) discusses training for Synchronous TSG.","{'title': '10 Related Work', 'number': '12'}"
"Our training algorithm is a generalization of forwardbackward EM training for finite-state (string) transducers, which is in turn a generalization of the original forwardbackward algorithm for Hidden Markov Models.","{'title': '10 Related Work', 'number': '12'}"
