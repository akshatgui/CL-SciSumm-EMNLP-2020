"Consider the following examples, suggested by Ritchie 1979: To map the temporal relations expressed in these examples onto linear time, and to try to express the semantics of when in terms of points or intervals (possibly associated with events), would appear to imply either that when is multiply ambiguous, allowing these points or intervals to be temporally related in at least three different ways, or that the relation expressed between main and when-clauses is one of approximate coincidence.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"
"However, neither of these tactics explains the peculiarity of utterances like the following: The unusual character of this statement seems to arise because the when-clause predicates something more than mere temporal coincidence, that is, some contingent relation such as a causal link or an enablement relation between the two events.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"

"We shall claim that the different temporal relations conveyed in examples (1) and (2) do not arise from any sense-ambiguity of when, or from any &quot;fuzziness&quot; in the relation that it expresses between the times referred to in the clauses it conjoins, but from the fact that the meaning of when is not primarily temporal at all.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"

"The apparent diversity of meanings arises from the nature of this referent and the organisation of events and states of affairs in episodic memory under a relation we shall call contingency, a term related, but not identical to a notion like causality, rather than mere temporal sequentiality.","{'title': '1 INTRODUCTION', 'number': '2'}"

"Dowty 1979, and the introduction to the present collection).","{'title': '2 TEMPORAL AND ASPECTUAL CATEGORIES', 'number': '3'}"
"The term aspectual type refers to the relation that a speaker predicates of the particular happening that their utterance describes, relative to other happenings in the domain of the discourse.","{'title': '2 TEMPORAL AND ASPECTUAL CATEGORIES', 'number': '3'}"
What the speaker says about those relations is of course quite distinct from what those relations objectively are.,"{'title': '2 TEMPORAL AND ASPECTUAL CATEGORIES', 'number': '3'}"

"For want of some established term to cover this very general class of dependencies between events, we will use the term contingency.","{'title': '2 TEMPORAL AND ASPECTUAL CATEGORIES', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus an utterance of is usually typical of what we will call a culmination— informally, an event which the speaker views as punctual or instantaneous, and as accompanied by a transition to a new state of the world.'","{'title': '2 TEMPORAL AND ASPECTUAL CATEGORIES', 'number': '3'}"

Harry is at the top.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"Part of the appeal of Vendler's account, and such descendants as the present proposal, is that it suggests that part of the meaning of any utterance of a sentence is one of a small number of temporal/aspectual profiles distinguished on a small number of dimensions.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"In present terms, the event-types can be distinguished on just two dimensions, one concerned with the contrast between punctuality and temporal extension, the other with the association with a consequent state.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
This subcategorisation can be summarized as in Figure 1.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"EVENTS STATES atomic extended understand, love, know, resemble +conseq CULMINATION CULMINATED recognize, spot, PROCESS win the race build a house, eat a sandwich -conseq POINT PROCESS hiccup, run, swim, walk, tap, wink play the piano We have included in Figure 1 examples of verbs which typically yield propositions of the relevant types, and we shall assume that such verbs (or, strictly speaking, the associated uninstantiated propositions) are lexically specified as bearing that type.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"However, it cannot be stressed too often that these aspectual profiles are properties of sentences used in a context: sense-meanings of sentences or verbs in isolation are usually compatible with several (or even all possible) Vendlerian profiles, as Dowty and Verkuyl have pointed out— hence the frequent use of words like &quot;typically&quot; and &quot;readily&quot; above.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"The details of this taxonomy and the criteria according to which utterances can be categorised are less important than the observation that each primitive entity of a given type, such as the culmination event of Harry's reaching the top, carries intimations of other associated events and states, such as the process by which the culmination was achieved and the consequent state that followed.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"What linguistic devices like tenses, aspects, and temporal/aspectual adverbials appear to do is to transform entities of one type into these other contingently related entities, or to turn them into composites with those related entities.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, we shall argue below that the progressive auxiliary demands that its argument be a process, which it predicates as ongoing.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"If it is combined with an event type that isn't a process, say with a punctual event as in Harry was hiccupping, then it will cause that original event to be reinterpreted as a process, in this case the process of iteration or repetition of the basic event.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"Similarly, we shall argue that a perfect auxiliary demands a culmination, predicating of the time referred to that the associated consequent state holds.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
The notion of &quot;time referred to&quot; is related to Reichenbach's reference time in Section 4.1 below.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"If the perfect is combined with an event description for which world knowledge provides no obvious culmination, then the ensemble will tend to be anomalous.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"So, for example, Harry has reached the top is fine, but The clock has ticked, and Harry has hummed, to the extent that they are acceptable at all, seem to demand rather special scenarios in which the tick of the clock and the mere act of humming have a momentousness that they usually lack.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"The phenomenon of change in the aspectual type of a proposition under the influence of modifiers like tenses, temporal adverbials, and aspectual auxiliaries is of central importance to the present account.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"We shall talk of such modifiers as functions which &quot;coerce&quot; their inputs to the appropriate type, by a loose analogy with type-coercion in programming languages (cf.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
Ait-Kaci 1984).,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
Thus the effect on meaning of the combination of the progressive with an expression denoting an atomic punctual event as in Sandra was hiccupping occurs in two stages: first the point proposition is coerced into a process of iteration of that point.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"Only then can this process be defined as ongoing, and hence as a progressive state.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"

"(point (Sandra hiccup)) (process (iteration (point (Sandra hiccup)))) (progressive (process (iteration (point (Sandra hiccup))))) The temporal/aspectual ontology that underlies the phenomenon of aspectual type coercion can be defined in terms of the transition network shown in Figure 2, in which each transition is associated with a change in the content and where, in addition, the felicity of any particular transition for a given proposition is conditional on support from knowledge and context. of discrete steps of climbing, resting, having lunch, or whatever.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"The consequent state may also be compound; most importantly, it includes the further events, if any, that are in the same sequence of contingently related events as the culmination.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"
"Similarly, the culmination itself may be a complex event.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '4'}"

"Rather than attempting to explain this diagram from first principles, we present below a number of examples of each transition.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"However, it is worth noting first that many of the permissible transitions between aspectual categories illustrated in Figure 2 appear to be related to a single elementary contingency-based event structure which we call a nucleus.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"A nucleus is defined as a structure comprising a culmination, an associated preparatory process, and a consequent state.2 It can be represented pictorially as in Figure 3: Any or all of these elements may be compound: for example, the preparation leading to the culmination of reaching the top of Mt.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"

"There is another route through the network in Figure 2, where the point is coerced into a culmination, i.e., as constituting an atomic event that does have consequences associated with it.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"In this case, the interpretation for (15) parallels the one given for Harry was reaching the top, below.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"

"When a culmination expression like reach the top is used with a progressive, it must be coerced to become a process in a slightly more complicated way.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"The most obvious path through the network in Figure 2 from the culmination node to the process node involves first adding a preparatory process to the culmination to make it a culminated process, then stripping off the culmination point as before.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
Thus sentences like the following describe this preparatory process as ongoing at the past reference time: 18.,"{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"

"Again, an iterated reading is possible in principle, but pragmatically unlikely here.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"As a result of the coercions implicit in the last two examples, it is no longer asserted that the culminations in question ever in fact occurred, but only that the associated preparatory processes did.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus there is no contradiction in continuations that explicitly deny the culmination, like: 19. a. Harry was running a mile, but he gave up after two laps. b. Harry was reaching the top when he slipped and fell to the bottom.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"The fact that, according to the present theory, progressives coerce their input to be a process so that any associated culmination is stripped away and no longer contributes to truth conditions provides a resolution of the imperfective paradox (Dowty 1979), without appealing to theory-external constructs like inertia worlds.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"

It is merely by accident that English uses the same device to convey these different meanings.,"{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"
"In French or German, for example, the two constructions are clearly distinct, as shown in the following translations of (35) and (32): Not all aspectual/temporal adverbials expressing a time span have the same functional type.","{'title': '3 ASPECT', 'number': '5'}"

"Tense is widely regarded as an anaphoric category, requiring a previously established temporal referent.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

Most accounts of the anaphoric nature of tense have invoked Reichenbach's (1947) trinity of underlying times and his concept of the positional use of the reference time.,"{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"Under these accounts, temporal adjuncts establish a referent to which the reference time of a main clause and subsequent same-tensed clauses may attach or refer, in much the same way that various species of full noun phrases establish referents for pronouns and definite anaphors (see foreword).","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"Reichenbach's account is somewhat inexplicit as far as extended, noninstantaneous events go.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"In particular, he makes it look as though the reference time is always an instant.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

McCawley 1971; Partee 1973; Isard 1974).,"{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"However, in one respect, the past tense does not behave like a pronoun: use of a pronoun such as &quot;she&quot; does not change the referent to which a subsequent use of the same pronoun may refer, whereas using a past tense may.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

"However, such a stipulation (besides creating problems for the theory vis-à-vis those narratives where reference time seems not to advance) seems to be unnecessary, since the amount by which the reference time advances still has to be determined by context.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

The definite nature of tense together with the notion of the nucleus as the knowledge structure that tensed expressions conjure up explain the apparent ambiguity of when-clauses with which this paper began.,"{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"A whenclause behaves rather like one of those phrases that are used to explicitly change topic, such as and your father in the following example (cf.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"Isard 1975): A when-clause does not require a previously established temporal focus, but rather brings into focus a novel temporal referent whose unique identifiability in the hearer's memory is presupposed.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"Again, the focused temporal referent is associated with an entire nucleus, and again an event main clause can refer to any part of this structure conditional on support from general or discourse specific knowledge.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, consider again Example 1 with which we began (repeated here): Once the core event of the when-clause has been identified in memory, the hearer has two alternative routes to construct a complete nucleus: a) to decompose the core event into a nucleus and to make a transition to one of the components, such as the preparatory activity of building or to the consequent state of having built the bridge; or b) to treat the entire event as a single culmination and compose it into a nucleus with whatever preparation and consequences the context provides for the activity of building a bridge, and to make the transition to either one of those.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"Either way, once the nucleus is established, the reference time of the main clause has to be situated somewhere within it—the exact location being determined by knowledge of the entities involved and the episode in question.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"So in Example 48a, the entire culminated process of building the bridge tends to become a culmination (via a path in Figure 2 that passes through the point node), which is associated in a nucleus with preparations for, and consequences of, the entire business, as in Figure 5: they prepare they have built to build the bridge The drawing up of the plans is then, for reasons to do with knowledge of the world, situated in the preparatory phase.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"In Example b, in contrast, people tend to see the building of the bridge as decomposed into a quite different preparatory process of building, a quite different culmination of completing the bridge and some consequences that we take to be also subtly distinct from those in the previous case as was argued in Section 3.2.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
The resulting nucleus is given in Figure 6.,"{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

"Thus a main clause event can potentially be situated anywhere along this nucleus, subject to support from knowledge about the precise events involved.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

"It is not clear where along this nucleus the culmination of the sun set could be situated: it is not easy to imagine that it is a functional part of the preparatory process typically associated with a breakdown, and it is similarly hard to imagine that it can be a part of the consequent state, so under most imaginable circumstances, the utterance remains bizarre.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
The constraints when places on possible interpretations of the relation between subordinate and main clause are therefore quite strong.,"{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

"Secondly, world knowledge also has to support the contingency relation between the events in subordinate and main clauses.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"As a result, many constructed examples sound strange or are. considered to be infelicitous, because too much context has to be imported to make sense of them.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"In all of the cases discussed so far, the main clause has been an event of some variety.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
"With stative main clauses, as in the following examples, the interpretation strategy is somewhat different.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

"The imperfective progressive decomposes the core event into a nucleus and makes a transition to the preparatory process, indicating that it is in progress at the time of reference.","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

"The progressive then indicates that the preparation leading up to the event as a whole was in progress at the time of reference (as usual, without asserting that that event or even its onset was ever reached).","{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"
The futurate progressive thus resembles the perfect in saying something about a (past or present) reference time that is entirely separate from the event time.,"{'title': '4 TENSE AND TEMPORAL Focus', 'number': '6'}"

"A full analysis of the modals would go beyond the scope of this paper, so the following remarks will be sketchy.","{'title': 'PAST', 'number': '7'}"
"The modal future clearly has a reference time not coincident with speech time, like the nonmodal future but unlike the futurate progressive.","{'title': 'PAST', 'number': '7'}"
"Nevertheless, Bennett and Partee are quite right that the modal future says something about the present as well as the past.","{'title': 'PAST', 'number': '7'}"
The source of its relevance to the time of speech must therefore have to do with the relation between modals and the time of speech.,"{'title': 'PAST', 'number': '7'}"
We make the following tentative suggestion about this relation.,"{'title': 'PAST', 'number': '7'}"
"Palmer 1974 pointed out a systematic ambiguity within the epistemic modals as between a futurate and a strictly present meaning, and Steedman 1977 related this to the similar ambiguity of a present-tensed sentence.","{'title': 'PAST', 'number': '7'}"
"What needs to be added seems to be the idea that these (suspiciously untensed looking) modals define properties of the time of speech (as is implied by the speech-act theoretic analysis of Boyd and Thorne 1969) and do not of themselves have anything to do with reference time and event time, unlike the true tensed and aspectual auxiliaries.","{'title': 'PAST', 'number': '7'}"

"We have argued in this paper that a principled and unified semantics of natural-language categories like tense, aspect, and aspectual/temporal adverbials requires an ontology based on contingency rather than temporality.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
The notion of nucleus plays a crucial role in this ontology.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"The process of temporal reference involves reference to the appropriate part of a nucleus, where appropriateness is a function of the inherent meaning of the core expression, of the coercive nature of co-occurring linguistic expressions, and of particular and general knowledge about the area of discourse.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
The identification of the correct ontology is also a vital preliminary to the construction and management of temporal databases.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
Effective exchange of information between people and machines is easier if the datastructures that are used to organise the information in the machine correspond in a natural way to the conceptual structures people use to organise the same information.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"In fact, the penalties for a bad fit between data-structures and human concepts are usually crippling for any attempt to provide natural language interfaces for database systems.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Information extracted from natural-language text can only be stored to the extent that it fits the preconceived formats, usually resulting in loss of information.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Conversely, such data-structures cannot easily be queried using natural language if there is a bad fit between the conceptual structure implicit in the query and the conceptual structure of the database.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
The contingency-based ontology that we are advocating here has a number of implications for the construction and management of such temporal databases.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Rather than a homogeneous database of dated points or intervals, we should partition it into distinct sequences of causally or otherwise contingently related sequences of events, which we might call episodes, each leading to the satisfaction of a particular goal or intention.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"This partition will quite incidentally define a partial temporal ordering on the events, but the primary purpose of such sequences is more related to the notion of a plan of action or an explanation of an event's occurrence than to anything to do with time itself.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
It follows that only events that are contingently related necessarily have well-defined temporal relations in memory.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"A first attempt to investigate this kind of system was reported in Steedman 1982, using a program that verified queries against a database structured according to some of the principles outlined above; a more recent extension of this work was reported in Moens 1987.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Events are stored as primitives in the database, possibly but not necessarily associated with a time point.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Extended events are represented in terms of a pair of punctual events, identifying their starting point as well as the point at which they end (in the case of processes) or culminate (in the case of culminated processes).","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Apart from the obvious accessibility relations of temporal precedence and simultaneity, events can also enter into the relation of contingency introduced above.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
It is significant that the relation used in the implementation is identical to the notion of causality used by Lansky 1986 in an entirely different problem area.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
She developed a knowledge representation scheme for use in planners in which events are reified and modeled with an explicit representation of their temporal as well as causal relations.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"In this scheme, a mechanism is provided for structuring events into so-called &quot;locations of activity&quot;, the boundaries of which are boundaries of &quot;causal&quot; access.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"As a result, two events with no causal relation between them cannot belong to the same location of activity—as in the episodes introduced above.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Because we follow Lansky in making the contingency relation intransitive, we avoid certain notorious problems in the treatment of when-clauses and perfects, which arise because the search for possible consequences of an event has to be restricted to the first event on the chain of contingencies.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Thus, when (3) is asserted, repeated here as (63a) and (b), it would be wrong to infer (c): 63. a.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"When John left, Sue cried. b.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"When Sue cried, her mother got upset. c. When John left, Sue's mother got upset.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"The reason is exactly the same as the reason that it would be wrong to infer that Sue's mother got upset because John left, and has nothing to do with the purely temporal relations of these events.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"It should also be noted that the notion of contingency used here (in line with Lansky's proposals) is weaker than the notion of causality used in other representation schemes (for example, that of McDermott 1982 or Allen 1984): if Event A stands in a contingent relation to Event B, then an occurrence of A will not automatically lead to an occuirence of B: John laying the foundations of the house is a prerequisite for or enables him to build the walls and roof, but does not cause it in the more traditional sense of the word and does not automatically or inevitably lead to him building the walls.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
The transitions in the network are implemented as inference procedures in the database.,"{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
"Answering a query involving the aspectual auxiliaries and adverbials discussed before consists of finding a matching event description in the database and checking its aspectual type; if the event description is found not to have the required aspectual type, it can be changed by means of the inference procedures, provided such a change is supported by knowledge in the database about the event in question.","{'title': '6 TOWARD A FORMAL REPRESENTATION', 'number': '8'}"
Many of the apparent anomalies and ambiguities that plague current semantic accounts of temporal expressions in natural language stem from the assumption that a linear model of time is the one that our linguistic categories are most directly related to.,"{'title': '7 CONCLUSION', 'number': '9'}"
"A more principled semantics is possible on the assumption that the temporal categories of tense, aspect, aspectual adverbials, and of propositions themselves refer to a mental representation of events that is structured on other than purely temporal principles, and to which the notion of a nucleus, or contingently related sequence of preparatory process, goal event, and consequent state, is central.","{'title': '7 CONCLUSION', 'number': '9'}"
