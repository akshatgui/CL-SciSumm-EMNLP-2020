"Efficient decoding has been a fundamental problem in machine translation, especially with an integrated language model which is essential for achieving good translation quality.",{}
We develop faster approaches for problem based on parsing algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on both phrase-based and syntax-based MT systems.,{}
"In both cases, our methods achieve significant speed improvements, often by more than a factor of ten, over the conventional beam-search method at the same levels of search error and translation accuracy.",{}
"Recent efforts in statistical machine translation (MT) have seen promising improvements in output quality, especially the phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, efficient decoding under these paradigms, especially with integrated language models (LMs), remains a difficult problem.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Part of the complexity arises from the expressive power of the translation model: for example, a phrase- or word-based model with full reordering has exponential complexity (Knight, 1999).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The language model also, if fully integrated into the decoder, introduces an expensive overhead for maintaining target-language boundary words for dynamic programming (Wu, 1996; Och and Ney, 2004).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In practice, one must prune the search space aggressively to reduce it to a reasonable size.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A much simpler alternative method to incorporate the LM is rescoring: we first decode without the LM (henceforth −LM decoding) to produce a k-best list of candidate translations, and then rerank the k-best list using the LM.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This method runs much faster in practice but often produces a considerable number of search errors since the true best translation (taking LM into account) is often outside of the k-best list.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) is a compromise between rescoring and full-integration: it rescores k subtranslations at each node of the forest, rather than only at the root node as in pure rescoring.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"By adapting the k-best parsing Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005), it achieves significant speed-up over full-integration on Chiang’s Hiero system.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We push the idea behind this method further and make the following contributions in this paper: Cube pruning and cube growing are collectively called forest rescoring since they both approximately rescore the packed forest of derivations from −LM decoding.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In practice they run an order of magnitude faster than full-integration with beam search, at the same level of search errors and translation accuracy as measured by BLEU.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We establish in this section a unified framework for translation with an integrated n-gram language model in both phrase-based systems and syntaxbased systems based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs).,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"An SCFG (Lewis and Stearns, 1968) is a context-free rewriting system for generating string pairs.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Each rule A → α, Q rewrites a pair of nonterminals in both languages, where α and Q are the source and target side components, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonterminal occurrences in α and the nonterminal occurrences in Q.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, the following rule captures the swapping of VP and PP between Chinese (source) and English (target).","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"We will use the following example from Chinese to English for both systems described in this section: yˇu Sh¯al´ong jˇuxing le huit´an with Sharon hold [past] meeting ‘held a meeting with Sharon’ A typical phrase-based decoder generates partial target-language outputs in left-to-right order in the form of hypotheses (Koehn, 2004).","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Each hypothesis has a coverage vector capturing the source-language words translated so far, and can be extended into a longer hypothesis by a phrase-pair translating an uncovered segment.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
This process can be formalized as a deductive system.,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, the following deduction step grows a hypothesis by the phrase-pair hyˇu Sh¯al´ong, with Sharoni: where a • in the coverage vector indicates the source word at this position is “covered” (for simplicity we omit here the ending position of the last phrase which is needed for distortion costs), and where w and w + c are the weights of the two hypotheses, respectively, with c being the cost of the phrase-pair.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Similarly, the decoding problem with SCFGs can also be cast as a deductive (parsing) system (Shieber et al., 1995).","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Basically, we parse the input string using the source projection of the SCFG while building the corresponding subtranslations in parallel.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"A possible deduction of the above example is notated: where the subscripts denote indices in the input sentence just as in CKY parsing, w1, w2 are the scores of the two antecedent items, and t1 and t2 are the corresponding subtranslations.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
The resulting translation t2t1 is the inverted concatenation as specified by the target-side of the SCFG rule with the additional cost c′ being the cost of this rule.,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
These two deductive systems represent the search space of decoding without a language model.,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"When one is instantiated for a particular input string, it defines a set of derivations, called a forest, represented in a compact structure that has a structure of a graph in the phrase-based case, or more generally, a hypergraph in both cases.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Accordingly we call items like (•••••) and (VP1,6) nodes in the forest, and instantiated deductions like we call hyperedges that connect one or more antecedent nodes to a consequent node.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"To integrate with a bigram language model, we can use the dynamic-programming algorithms of Och and Ney (2004) and Wu (1996) for phrase-based and SCFG-based systems, respectively, which we may think of as doing a finer-grained version of the deductions above.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Each node v in the forest will be split into a set of augmented items, which we call +LM items.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"For phrase-based decoding, a +LM item has the form (v a) where a is the last word of the hypothesis.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
Thus a +LM version of Deduction (1) might be: where the score of the resulting +LM item w′ = w + c − log Plm(with  |talk) now includes a combination cost due to the bigrams formed when applying the phrase-pair.,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Similarly, a +LM item in SCFG-based models has the form (va*b), where a and b are boundary words of the hypothesis string, and ⋆ is a placeholder symbol for an elided part of that string, indicating that a possible translation of the part of the input spanned by v starts with a and ends with b.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
An example +LM version of Deduction (2) is: where w = w1 +w2 +c′−log Plm(with  |talk) with a similar combination cost formed in combining adjacent boundary words of antecedents.,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"This scheme can be easily extended to work with a general ngram model (Chiang, 2007).","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
The experiments in this paper use trigram models.,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
The conventional full-integration approach traverses the forest bottom-up and explores all possible +LM deductions along each hyperedge.,"{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"The theoretical running time of this algorithm is O(|F||T|(m−1)) for phrase-based models, and O(|F||T|4(m−1)) for binary-branching SCFG-based models, where |F |is the size of the forest, and |T| is the number of possible target-side words.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Even if we assume a constant number of translations for each word in the input, with a trigram model, this still amounts to O(n11) for SCFG-based models and O(2nn2) for phrase-based models.","{'title': '2 Preliminaries', 'number': '2'}"
"Cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) reduces the search space significantly based on the observation that when the above method is combined with beam search, only a small fraction of the possible +LM items at a node will escape being pruned, and moreover we can select with reasonable accuracy those top-k items without computing all possible items first.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"In a nutshell, cube pruning works on the −LM forest, keeping at most k +LM items at each node, and uses the k-best parsing Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005) to speed up the computation.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"For simplicity of presentation, we will use concrete SCFG-based examples, but the method applies to the general hypergraph framework in Section 2.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
Consider Figure 1(a).,"{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Here k = 3 and we use D(v) to denote the top-k +LM items (in sorted order) of node v. Suppose we have computed D(u1) and D(u2) for the two antecedent nodes u1 = (VP3,6) and u2 = (PP1,3) respectively.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Then for the consequent node v = (VP1,6) we just need to derive the top-3 from the 9 combinations of (Di(u1), Dj(u2)) with i, j E [1, 3].","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Since the antecedent items are sorted, it is very likely that the best consequent items in this grid lie towards the upper-left corner.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
This situation is very similar to kbest parsing and we can adapt the Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005) here to explore this grid in a best-first order.,"{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Suppose that the combination costs are negligible, and therefore the weight of a consequent item is just the product of the weights of the antecedent items.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Then we know that D1(v) = (D1(u1),D1(u2)), the upper-left corner of the grid.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Moreover, we know that D2(v) is the better of (D1(u1), D2(u2)) and (D2(u1),D1(u2)), the two neighbors of the upper-left corner.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"We continue in this way (see Figure 1(b)–(d)), enumerating the consequent items best-first while keeping track of a relatively small number of candidates (shaded cells in Figure 1(b), cand in Figure 2) for the next-best item.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"However, when we take into account the combination costs, this grid is no longer monotonic in general, and the above algorithm will not always enumerate items in best-first order.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"We can see this in the first iteration in Figure 1(b), where an item with score 2.5 has been enumerated even though there is an item with score 2.4 still to come.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus we risk making more search errors than the full-integration method, but in practice the loss is much less significant than the speedup.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Because of this disordering, we do not put the enumerated items directly into D(v); instead, we collect items in a buffer (buf in Figure 2) and re-sort the buffer into D(v) after it has accumulated k items.1 In general the grammar may have multiple rules that share the same source side but have different target sides, which we have treated here as separate k-best +LM rescoring.. . only at the root node on-the-fly at each node on-the-fly at each node hyperedges in the −LM forest.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"In Hiero, these hyperedges are processed as a single unit which we call a hyperedge bundle.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"The different target sides then constitute a third dimension of the grid, forming a cube of possible combinations (Chiang, 2007).","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Now consider that there are many hyperedges that derive v, and we are only interested the top +LM items of v over all incoming hyperedges.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Following Algorithm 2, we initialize the priority queue cand with the upper-left corner item from each hyperedge, and proceed as above.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
See Figure 2 for the pseudocode for cube pruning.,"{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"We use the notation (e, j) to identify the derivation of v via the hyperedge e and the jith best subderivation of antecedent ui (1 < i < |j|).","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, we let 1 stand for a vector whose elements are all 1, and W for the vector whose members are all 0 except for the ith whose value is 1 (the dimensionality of either should be evident from the context).","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
The heart of the algorithm is lines 10–12.,"{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Lines 10–11 move the best derivation (e, j) from cand to buf , and then line 12 pushes its successors {(e, j + W)  |i E 1... |e|I into cand.","{'title': '3 Cube Pruning', 'number': '3'}"
"Although much faster than full-integration, cube pruning still computes a fixed amount of +LM items at each node, many of which will not be useful for arriving at the 1-best hypothesis at the root.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
It would be more efficient to compute as few +LM items at each node as are needed to obtain the 1-best hypothesis at the root.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"This new method, called cube growing, is a lazy version of cube pruning just as Algorithm 3 of Huang and Chiang (2005), is a lazy version of Algorithm 2 (see Table 1).","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"Instead of traversing the forest bottom-up, cube growing visits nodes recursively in depth-first order from the root node (Figure 4).","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"First we call LAZYJTHBEST(TOP,1), which uses the same algorithm as cube pruning to find the 1-best +LM item of the root node using the best +LM items of assuming hcombo(e) = 0.1 for this hyperedge; (b) cube growing prevents early ranking of the top-left cell (2.5) as the best item in this grid. the antecedent nodes.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"However, in this case the best +LM items of the antecedent nodes are not known, because we have not visited them yet.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
So we recursively invoke LAZYJTHBEST on the antecedent nodes to obtain them as needed.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"Each invocation of LAZYJTHBEST(v, j) will recursively call itself on the antecedents of v until it is confident that the jth best +LM item for node v has been found.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"Consider again the case of one hyperedge e. Because of the nonmonotonicity caused by combination costs, the first +LM item ((e,1)) popped from cand is not guaranteed to be the best of all combinations along this hyperedge (for example, the top-left cell of 2.5 in Figure 1 is not the best in the grid).","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"So we cannot simply enumerate items just as they come off of cand.2 Instead, we need to store up popped items in a buffer buf , just as in cube pruning, and enumerate an item only when we are confident that it will never be surpassed in the future.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"In other words, we would like to have an estimate of the best item not explored yet (analogous to the heuristic function in A* search).","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"If we can establish a lower bound hcombo(e) on the combination cost of any +LM deduction via hyperedge e, then we can form a monotonic grid (see Figure 3(a)) of lower bounds on the grid of combinations, by using hcombo(e) in place of the true combination cost for each +LM item x in the grid; call this lower bound h(x).","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
Now suppose that the gray-shaded cells in Figure 3(a) are the members of cand.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"Then the minimum of h(x) over the items in cand, in this example, min{2.2, 5.1} = 2.2 is a lower bound on the cost of any item in the future for the hyperedge e. Indeed, if cand contains items from multiple hyperedges for a single consequent node, this is still a valid lower bound.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
More formally: Lemma 1.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"For each node v in the forest, the term is a lower bound on the true cost of any future item that is yet to be explored for v. Proof.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"For any item x that is not explored yet, the true cost c(x) > h(x), by the definition of h. And there exists an item y E cand[v] along the same hyperedge such that h(x) > h(y), due to the monotonicity of h within the grid along one hyperedge.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
We also have h(y) > bound by the definition of bound.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
Therefore c(x) > bound.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"Now we can safely pop the best item from buf if its true cost MIN(buf ) is better than bound and pass it up to the consequent node (lines 21–23); but otherwise, we have to wait for more items to accumulate in buf to prevent a potential search error, for example, in the case of Figure 3(b), where the top-left cell current bin (#2) into longer ones.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"(b) In Cubit, hypotheses in previous bins are fed via hyperedge bundles (solid arrows) into a priority queue (shaded triangle), which empties into the current bin (#5).","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"

The update of bound in each iteration (line 10) can be efficiently implemented by using another heap with the same contents as cand but prioritized by h instead.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
In practice this is a negligible overhead on top of cube pruning.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"We now turn to the problem of estimating the heuristic function h,o,,,bo.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"In practice, computing true lower bounds of the combination costs is too slow and would compromise the speed up gained from cube growing.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
So we instead use a much simpler method that just calculates the minimum combination cost of each hyperedge in the top-i derivations of the root node in −LM decoding.,"{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"This is just an approximation of the true lower bound, and bad estimates can lead to search errors.","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
"However, the hope is that by choosing the right value of i, these estimates will be accurate enough to affect the search quality only slightly, which is analogous to “almost admissible” heuristics in A* search (Soricut, 2006).","{'title': '4 Cube Growing', 'number': '4'}"
