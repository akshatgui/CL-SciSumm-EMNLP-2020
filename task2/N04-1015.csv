"We consider the problem of modeling the content structure of texts within a specific do main, in terms of the topics the texts address and the order in which these topics appear.",{}
"We first present an effective knowledge-leanmethod for learning content models from unannotated documents, utilizing a novel adaptation of algorithms for Hidden Markov Models.",{}
We then apply our method to two complementary tasks: information ordering and ex tractive summarization.,{}
Our experiments showthat incorporating content models in these ap plications yields substantial improvement over previously-proposed methods.,{}

"Previous research has sought to characterize texts in terms of domain-independent rhetorical elements, such as schema items (McKeown, 1985) or rhetorical relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Marcu, 1997).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The focus of ourwork, however, is on an equally fundamental but domain dependent dimension of the structure of text: content.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Our use of the term ?content?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
corresponds roughly to the notions of topic and topic change.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We desire models that can specify, for example, that articles about earthquakes typically contain information about quake strength, location, and casualties, and that descriptions of casualties usually precede those of rescue efforts.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"But rather than manually determine the topics for a given domain, we take a distributional view, learning them directly from un-annotated texts via analysis of word distribution patterns.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
