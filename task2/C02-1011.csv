We propose a new method to perform the task.,{}
"For a given Base NP, we first search its translation candidates from the web.",{}
We next determine the possible translation(s) from among the candidates using one of the two methods that we have developed.,{}
"In one method, we employ an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers constructed with the EM Algorithm.",{}

Experimental results indicate that the coverage and accuracy of our method are significantly better than those of the baseline methods relying on existing technologies.,{}
"We address here the problem of Base NP translation, in which for a given Base Noun Phrase in a source language (e.g., ?information age?","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"in English), we are to find out its possible translation(s) in a target language (e.g., ?","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"In many cases, Base NPs represent holistic and non-divisible concepts, and thus accurate translation of them from one language to another is extremely important in applications like machine translation, cross language information retrieval, and foreign language writing assistance.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"In translation candidate collection, for a given Base NP in the source language, we look for its translation candidates in the target language.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"In the first method, we view the problem as that of classification and employ an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers constructed with the EM Algorithm.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

2.1 Translation with Non-parallel.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Corpora A straightforward approach to word or phrase translation is to perform the task by using parallel bilingual corpora (e.g., Brown et al 1993).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Parallel corpora are, however, difficult to obtain in practice.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"To deal with this difficulty, a number of methods have been proposed, which make use of relatively easily obtainable non-parallel corpora (e.g., Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Within these methods, it is usually assumed that a number of translation candidates for a word or phrase are given (or can be easily collected) and the problem is focused on translation selection.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"All of the proposed methods manage to find out the translation(s) of a given word or phrase, on the basis of the linguistic phenomenon that the contexts of a translation tend to be similar to the contexts of the given word or phrase.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Fung and Yee (1998), for example, proposed to represent the contexts of a word or phrase with a real-valued vector (e.g., a TF-IDF vector), in which one element corresponds to one word in the contexts.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In translation selection, they select the translation candidates whose context vectors are the closest to that of the given word or phrase.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Since the context vector of the word or phrase to be translated corresponds to words in the source language, while the context vector of a translation candidate corresponds to words in the target language, and further the words in the source language and those in the target language have a many-to-many relationship (i.e., translation ambiguities), it is necessary to accurately transform the context vector in the source language to a context vector in the target language before distance calculation.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The vector-transformation problem was not, however, well-resolved previously.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
Fung and Yee assumed that in a specific domain there is only one-to-one mapping relationship between words in the two languages.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The assumption is reasonable in a specific domain, but is too strict in the general domain, in which we presume to perform translation here.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
A straightforward extension of Fung and Yee?s assumption to the general domain is to restrict the many-to-many relationship to that of many-to-one mapping (or one-to-one mapping).,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This approach, however, has a drawback of losing information in vector transformation, as will be described.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For other methods using non-parallel corpora, see also (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Kikui, 1999, Koehn and Kevin 2000; Sumita 2000; Nakagawa 2001; Gao et al 2001).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
2.2 Translation Using Web Data.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Web is an extremely rich source of data for natural language processing, not only in terms of data size but also in terms of data type (e.g., multilingual data, link data).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Recently, a new trend arises in natural language processing, which tries to bring some new breakthroughs to the field by effectively using web data (e.g., Brill et al 2001).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Nagata et al(2001), for example, proposed to collect partial parallel corpus data on the web to create a translation dictionary.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '2'}"
"They observed that there are many partial parallel corpora between English and Japanese on the web, and most typically English translations of Japanese terms (words or phrases) are parenthesized and inserted immediately after the Japanese terms in documents written in Japanese.","{'title': 'Related Work.
