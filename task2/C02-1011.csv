We consider here the problem of Base Noun Phrase translation.,Introduction
We propose a new method to perform the task.,Introduction
"For a given Base NP, we first search its translation candidates from the web.",Introduction
We next determine the possible translation(s) from among the candidates using one of the two methods that we have developed.,Introduction
"In one method, we employ an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers constructed with the EM Algorithm.",Introduction
"In the other method, we use TF-IDF vectors also constructed with the EM Algorithm.",Introduction
Experimental results indicate that the coverage and accuracy of our method are significantly better than those of the baseline methods relying on existing technologies.,Introduction
"We address here the problem of Base NP translation, in which for a given Base Noun Phrase in a source language (e.g., ?information age?",Experiment/Discussion
"in English), we are to find out its possible translation(s) in a target language (e.g., ?",Experiment/Discussion
in Chinese).,Experiment/Discussion
We define a Base NP as a simple and non-recursive noun phrase.,Experiment/Discussion
"In many cases, Base NPs represent holistic and non-divisible concepts, and thus accurate translation of them from one language to another is extremely important in applications like machine translation, cross language information retrieval, and foreign language writing assistance.",Experiment/Discussion
"In this paper, we propose a new method for Base NP translation, which contains two steps: (1) translation candidate collection, and (2) translation selection.",Experiment/Discussion
"In translation candidate collection, for a given Base NP in the source language, we look for its translation candidates in the target language.",Experiment/Discussion
"To do so, we use a word-to-word translation dictionary and corpus data in the target language on the web.",Experiment/Discussion
"In translation selection, we determine the possible translation(s) from among the candidates.",Experiment/Discussion
We use non-parallel corpus data in the two languages on the web and employ one of the two methods which we have developed.,Experiment/Discussion
"In the first method, we view the problem as that of classification and employ an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers constructed with the EM Algorithm.",Experiment/Discussion
We will use ?EM-NBC-Ensemble?,Experiment/Discussion
"to denote this method, hereafter.",Experiment/Discussion
"In the second method, we view the problem as that of calculating similarities between context vectors and use TF-IDF vectors also constructed with the EM Algorithm.",Experiment/Discussion
We will use ?EM-TF-IDF?,Experiment/Discussion
to denote this method.,Experiment/Discussion
"Experimental results indicate that our method is very effective, and the coverage and top 3 accuracy of translation at the final stage are 91.4% and 79.8%, respectively.",Experiment/Discussion
The results are significantly better than those of the baseline methods relying on existing technologies.,Experiment/Discussion
The higher performance of our method can be attributed to the enormity of the web data used and the employment of the EM Algorithm.,Experiment/Discussion
2.1 Translation with Non-parallel.,Experiment/Discussion
"Corpora A straightforward approach to word or phrase translation is to perform the task by using parallel bilingual corpora (e.g., Brown et al 1993).",Experiment/Discussion
"Parallel corpora are, however, difficult to obtain in practice.",Experiment/Discussion
"To deal with this difficulty, a number of methods have been proposed, which make use of relatively easily obtainable non-parallel corpora (e.g., Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000).",Experiment/Discussion
"Within these methods, it is usually assumed that a number of translation candidates for a word or phrase are given (or can be easily collected) and the problem is focused on translation selection.",Experiment/Discussion
"All of the proposed methods manage to find out the translation(s) of a given word or phrase, on the basis of the linguistic phenomenon that the contexts of a translation tend to be similar to the contexts of the given word or phrase.",Experiment/Discussion
"Fung and Yee (1998), for example, proposed to represent the contexts of a word or phrase with a real-valued vector (e.g., a TF-IDF vector), in which one element corresponds to one word in the contexts.",Experiment/Discussion
"In translation selection, they select the translation candidates whose context vectors are the closest to that of the given word or phrase.",Experiment/Discussion
"Since the context vector of the word or phrase to be translated corresponds to words in the source language, while the context vector of a translation candidate corresponds to words in the target language, and further the words in the source language and those in the target language have a many-to-many relationship (i.e., translation ambiguities), it is necessary to accurately transform the context vector in the source language to a context vector in the target language before distance calculation.",Experiment/Discussion
"The vector-transformation problem was not, however, well-resolved previously.",Experiment/Discussion
Fung and Yee assumed that in a specific domain there is only one-to-one mapping relationship between words in the two languages.,Experiment/Discussion
"The assumption is reasonable in a specific domain, but is too strict in the general domain, in which we presume to perform translation here.",Experiment/Discussion
A straightforward extension of Fung and Yee?s assumption to the general domain is to restrict the many-to-many relationship to that of many-to-one mapping (or one-to-one mapping).,Experiment/Discussion
"This approach, however, has a drawback of losing information in vector transformation, as will be described.",Experiment/Discussion
"For other methods using non-parallel corpora, see also (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Kikui, 1999, Koehn and Kevin 2000; Sumita 2000; Nakagawa 2001; Gao et al 2001).",Experiment/Discussion
2.2 Translation Using Web Data.,Experiment/Discussion
"Web is an extremely rich source of data for natural language processing, not only in terms of data size but also in terms of data type (e.g., multilingual data, link data).",Experiment/Discussion
"Recently, a new trend arises in natural language processing, which tries to bring some new breakthroughs to the field by effectively using web data (e.g., Brill et al 2001).",Experiment/Discussion
"Nagata et al(2001), for example, proposed to collect partial parallel corpus data on the web to create a translation dictionary.",Experiment/Discussion
"They observed that there are many partial parallel corpora between English and Japanese on the web, and most typically English translations of Japanese terms (words or phrases) are parenthesized and inserted immediately after the Japanese terms in documents written in Japanese.",Experiment/Discussion
Our method for Base NP translation comprises of two steps: translation candidate collection and translation selection.,Experiment/Discussion
"In translation candidate collection, we look for translation candidates of a given Base NP.",Experiment/Discussion
"In translation selection, we find out possible translation(s) from the translation candidates.",Experiment/Discussion
"In this paper, we confine ourselves to translation of noun-noun pairs from English to Chinese; our method, however, can be extended to translations of other types of Base NPs between other language pairs.",Experiment/Discussion
3.1 Translation Candidate Collection.,Experiment/Discussion
We use heuristics for translation candidate collection.,Experiment/Discussion

EM-NBC-Ensemble We view the translation selection problem as that of classification and employ EM-NBC-Ensemble to perform the task.,Experiment/Discussion
"For the ease of explanation, we first describe the algorithm of using only EM-NBC and next extend it to that of using EM-NBC-Ensemble.",Experiment/Discussion
Basic Algorithm Let e~ denote the Base NP to be translated and C~ the set of its translation candidates (phrases).,Experiment/Discussion

"Algorithm of EM-NBC-Ensemble Context Information As input data, we use ?contexts?",Experiment/Discussion
in English which contain the phrase to be translated.,Experiment/Discussion
We also use contexts in Chinese which contain the translation candidates.,Experiment/Discussion
"Here, a context containing a phrase is defined as the surrounding words within a window of a predetermined size, which window covers the phrase.",Experiment/Discussion
We can easily obtain the data by searching for them on the web.,Experiment/Discussion
"Actually, the contexts containing the candidates are obtained at the same time when we conduct translation candidate collection (Step 4 in Figure 1).",Experiment/Discussion

"EM-NBC-Ensemble To further improve performance, we use an ensemble (i.e., a linear combination) of EM-NBCs (EM-NBC-Ensemble), while the classifiers are constructed on the basis of the data in different contexts with different window sizes.",Experiment/Discussion
"More specifically, we calculate where s),1,(i, L=iD denotes the data in different contexts.",Experiment/Discussion
3.3 Translation Selection -- EM-TF-IDF.,Experiment/Discussion
We view the translation selection problem as that of calculating similarities between context vectors and use as context vectors TF-IDF vectors constructed with the EM Algorithm.,Experiment/Discussion

Algorithm of EM-TF-IDF 3.4 Advantage of Using EM Algorithm.,Experiment/Discussion
The uses of EM-NBC-Ensemble and EM-TF-IDF can be viewed as extensions of existing methods for word or phrase translation using non-parallel corpora.,Experiment/Discussion
"Particularly, the use of the EM Algorithm can help to accurately transform a frequency vector from one language to another.",Experiment/Discussion
Suppose that we are to determine if ?,Experiment/Discussion
is a translation of ?information age?,Experiment/Discussion
(actually it is).,Experiment/Discussion
The frequency vectors of context words for ?information age?,Experiment/Discussion
and ?,Experiment/Discussion
"are given in A and D in Figure 5, respectively.",Experiment/Discussion
"If for each English word we only retain the link connecting to the Chinese translation with the largest frequency (a link represented as a solid line) to establish a many-to-one mapping and transform vector A from English to Chinese, we obtain vector B. It turns out, however, that vector B is quite different from vector D, although they should be similar to each other.",Experiment/Discussion
We will refer to this method as ?Major Translation?,Experiment/Discussion
hereafter.,Experiment/Discussion
"With EM, vector A in Figure 5 is transformed into vector C, which is much closer to vector D, as expected.",Experiment/Discussion
"Specifically, EM can split the frequency of a word in English and distribute them into its translations in Chinese in a theoretically sound way (cf., the distributed frequencies of ?internet?).",Experiment/Discussion
"Note that if we assume a many-to-one (or one-to-one) mapping ? = = s i icP s cP 1 )|~(1)|~( DD (5) relationship, then the use of EM turns out to be equivalent to that of Major Translation.",Experiment/Discussion
3.5 Combination.,Experiment/Discussion
"In order to further boost the performance of translation, we propose to also use the translation method proposed in Nagata et al Specifically, we combine our method with that of Nagata et alby using a back-off strategy.",Experiment/Discussion
Figure 6 illustrates the process of collecting Chinese translation candidates for an English Base NP ?information asymmetry?,Experiment/Discussion
with Nagata et al?s method.,Experiment/Discussion
"In the combination of the two methods, we first use Nagata et als method to perform translation; if we cannot find translations, we next use our method.",Experiment/Discussion
We will denote this strategy ?Back-off?.,Experiment/Discussion

"The key components are (1) distance calculation by KL divergence (2) EM, (3) prior probability, and (4) ensemble.",Results/Conclusion
"The variants, thus, respectively make use of (1) the baseline method ?Prior?, (2) an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers based on Major Translation (MT-NBC-Ensemble), (3) an ensemble of EM-based KL divergence calculations (EM-KL-Ensemble), and (4) EM-NBC.",Results/Conclusion
