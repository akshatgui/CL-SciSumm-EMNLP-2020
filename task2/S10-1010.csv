"The ultimate aim of temporal processing is the automatic identification of all temporal referring expressions, events and temporal relations within a text.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"The 2007 SemEval task, TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007; Verhagen et al., 2009), was an initial evaluation exercise based on three limited temporal ordering and anchoring tasks that were considered realistic both from the perspective of assembling resources for development and testing and from the perspective of developing systems capable of addressing the tasks.1 TempEval-2 is based on TempEval-1, but is more elaborate in two respects: (i) it is a multilingual task, and (ii) it consists of six subtasks rather than three.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In the rest of this paper, we first introduce the data that we are dealing with.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Which gets us in a position to present the list of task introduced by TempEval-2, including some motivation as to why we feel that it is a good idea to split up temporal relation classification into sub tasks.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We proceed by shortly describing the data resources and their creation, followed by the performance of the systems that participated in the tasks.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The TempEval annotation language is a simplified version of TimeML.2 using three TimeML tags: TIMEX3, EVENT and TLINK.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
TIMEX3 tags the time expressions in the text and is identical to the TIMEX3 tag in TimeML.,"{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Times can be expressed syntactically by adverbial or prepositional phrases, as shown in the following example.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"The two main attributes of the TIMEX3 tag are TYPE and VAL, both shown in the example (2). type=&quot;DATE&quot; val=&quot;2004-11-22&quot; For TempEval-2, we distinguish four temporal types: TIME (at 2:45 p.m.), DATE (January 27, 1920, yesterday), DURATION (two weeks) and SET (every Monday morning).","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"The VAL attribute assumes values according to an extension of the ISO 8601 standard, as enhanced by TIMEX2.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Each document has one special TIMEX3 tag, the Document Creation Time (DCT), which is interpreted as an interval that spans a whole day.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
The EVENT tag is used to annotate those elements in a text that describe what is conventionally referred to as an eventuality.,"{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"Syntactically, events are typically expressed as inflected verbs, although event nominals, such as ”crash” in killed by the crash, should also be annotated as EVENTS.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"The most salient event attributes encode tense, aspect, modality and polarity information.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"

"For TempEval, the set of labels was simplified to aid data preparation and to reduce the complexity of the task.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
"We use only six relation types including the three core relations BEFORE, AFTER, and OVERLAP, the two less specific relations BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP and OVERLAP-OR-AFTER for ambiguous cases, and finally the relation VAGUE for those cases where no particular relation can be established.","{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"
Temporal relations come in two broad flavours: anchorings of events to time expressions and orderings of events.,"{'title': '2 TempEval Annotation', 'number': '2'}"

"Of these tasks, C, D and E were also defined for TempEval-1.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"
"However, the syntactic locality restriction in task C was not present in TempEval-1.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"
"Task participants could choose to either do all tasks, focus on the time expression task, focus on the event task, or focus on the four temporal relation tasks.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"
"In addition, participants could choose one or more of the six languages for which we provided data: Chinese, English, French, Italian, Korean, and Spanish.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"
"We feel that well-defined tasks allow us to structure the workflow, allowing us to create taskspecific guidelines and using task-specific annotation tools to speed up annotation.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"
"More importantly, each task can be evaluated in a fairly straightforward way, contrary to for example the problems that pop up when evaluating two complex temporal graphs for the same document.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"
"In addition, tasks can be ranked, allowing systems to feed the results of one (more precise) task as a feature into another task.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"
"Splitting the task into substask reduces the error rate in the manual annotation, and that merging the different sub-task into a unique layer as a postprocessing operation (see figure 1) provides better and more reliable results (annotated data) than doing a complex task all at once.","{'title': '3 TempEval-2 Tasks', 'number': '3'}"

"Most languages used BAT, the Brandeis Annotation Tool (Verhagen, 2010), a generic webbased annotation tool that is centered around the notion of annotation tasks.","{'title': '4 Data Preparation', 'number': '4'}"
"With the task decomposition allowed by BAT, it is possible to structure the complex task of temporal annotation by splitting it up in as many sub tasks as seems useful.","{'title': '4 Data Preparation', 'number': '4'}"
"As 3Seehttp://www.timeml.org. such, BAT was well-suited for TempEval-2 annotation.","{'title': '4 Data Preparation', 'number': '4'}"
"We now give a few more details on the English and Spanish data, skipping the other languages for reasons that will become obvious at the beginning of section 6.","{'title': '4 Data Preparation', 'number': '4'}"
"The English data sets were based on TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Boguraev et al., 2007), a hand-built gold standard of annotated texts using the TimeML markup scheme.4 However, all event annotation was reviewed to make sure that the annotation complied with the latest guidelines and all temporal relations were added according to the Tempeval-2 relation tasks, using the specified relation types.","{'title': '4 Data Preparation', 'number': '4'}"

"For the extents of events and time expressions (tasks A and B), precision, recall and the f1-measure are used as evaluation metrics, using the following formulas: Where tp is the number of tokens that are part of an extent in both key and response, fp is the number of tokens that are part of an extent in the response but not in the key, and fn is the number of tokens that are part of an extent in the key but not in the response.","{'title': '5 Evaluation Metrics', 'number': '5'}"

"Such a difference in performance of the systems could be due to differences in annotation accurateness, or it could be due to some particularities of how the two languages express certain temporal aspects, or perhaps the one corpus is more homogeneous than the other.","{'title': '6 System Results', 'number': '6'}"
"Again, there are not enough data points, but the issue deserves further attention.","{'title': '6 System Results', 'number': '6'}"
