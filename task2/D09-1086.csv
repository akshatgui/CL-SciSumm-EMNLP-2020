"Consider the problem of learning a dependency parser, which must produce a directed tree whose vertices are the words of a given sentence.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
There are many differing conventions for representing syntactic relations in dependency trees.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Say that we wish to output parses in the Prague style and so have annotated a small target corpus—e.g., 100 sentences—with those conventions.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
A parser trained on those hundred sentences will achieve mediocre dependency accuracy (the proportion of words that attach to their correct parent).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
But what if we also had a large number of trees in the CoNLL style (the source corpus)?,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Ideally they should help train our parser.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"But unfortunately, a parser that learned to produce perfect CoNLL-style trees would, for example, get both links “wrong” when its coordination constructions were evaluated against a Prague-style gold standard (Figure 1).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"If it were just a matter of this one construction, the obvious solution would be to write a few rules by hand to transform the large source training corpus into the target style.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Suppose, however, that there were many more ways that our corpora differed.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Then we would like to learn a statistical model to transform one style of tree into another.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We may not possess hand-annotated training data for this tree-to-tree transformation task.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
That would require the two corpora to annotate some of the same sentences in different styles.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"But fortunately, we can automatically obtain a noisy form of the necessary paired-tree training data.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A parser trained on the source corpus can parse the sentences in our target corpus, yielding trees (or more generally, probability distributions over trees) in the source style.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We will then learn a tree transformation model relating these noisy source trees to our known trees in the target style.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This model should enable us to convert the original large source corpus to target style, giving us additional training data in the target style.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For many target languages, however, we do not have the luxury of a large parsed “source corpus” in the language, even one in a different style or domain as above.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Thus, we may seek other forms of data to augment our small target corpus.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"One option would be to leverage unannotated text (McClosky et al., 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2007).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
But we can also try to transfer syntactic information from a parsed source corpus in another language.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This is an extreme case of out-of-domain data.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This leads to the second task of this paper: learning a statistical model to transform a syntactic analysis of a sentence in one language into an analysis of its translation.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Tree transformations are often modeled with synchronous grammars.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Suppose we are given a sentence w' in the “source” language and its translation w into the “target” language.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Their syntactic parses t' and t are presumably not independent, but will tend to have some parallel or at least correlated structure.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"So we could jointly model the parses t', t and the alignment a between them, with a model of the form p(t, a, t' I w, w').","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Such a joint model captures how t, a, t' mutually constrain each other, so that even partial knowledge of some of these three variables can help us to recover the others when training or decoding on bilingual text.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This idea underlies a number of recent papers on syntax-based alignment (using t and t' to better recover a), grammar induction from bitext (using a to better recover t and t'), parser projection (using t' and a to better recover t), as well as full joint parsing (Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we condition on the 1-best source tree t'.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As for the alignment a, our models either condition on the 1-best alignment or integrate the alignment out.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our models are thus of the form p(t w, w', t', a) or, in the generative case, p(w, t, a w', t').","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We intend to consider other formulations in future work.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"So far, this is very similar to the monolingual parser adaptation scenario, but there are a few key differences.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Since the source and target sentences in the bitext are in different languages, there is no longer a trivial alignment between the words of the source and target trees.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Given word alignments, we could simply try to project dependency links in the source tree onto the target text.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A link-by-link projection, however, could result in invalid trees on the target side, with cycles or disconnected words.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Instead, our models learn the necessary transformations that align and transform a source tree into a target tree by means of quasisynchronous grammar (QG) features.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Figure 2 shows an example of bitext helping disambiguation when a parser is trained with only a small number of Chinese trees.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"With the help of the English tree and alignment, the parser is able to recover the correct Chinese dependencies using QG features.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Incorrect edges from the monolingual parser are shown with dashed lines.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"(The bilingual parser corrects additional errors in the second half of this sentence, which has been removed to improve legibility.)","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The parser is able to recover the long-distance dependency from the first Chinese word (China) to the last (begun), while skipping over the intervening noun phrase that confused the undertrained monolingual parser.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Although, due to the auxiliary verb, “China” and “begun” are siblings in English and not in direct dependency, the QG features still leverage this indirect projection.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We start by describing the features we use to augment conditional and generative parsers when scoring pairs of trees (§2).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Then we discuss in turn monolingual (§3) and cross-lingual (§4) parser adaptation.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Finally, we present experiments on cross-lingual parser projection in conditions when no target language trees are available for training (§5) and when some trees are available (§6).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
What should our model of source and target trees look like?,"{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"In our view, traditional approaches based on synchronous grammar are problematic both computationally and linguistically.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
Full inference takes O(n6) time or worse (depending on the grammar formalism).,"{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"Yet synchronous models only consider a limited hypothesis space: e.g., parses must be projective, and alignments must decompose according to the recursive parse structure.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"(For example, two nodes can be aligned only if their respective parents are also aligned.)","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"The synchronous model’s probability mass function is also restricted to decompose in this way, so it makes certain conditional independence assumptions; put another way, it can evaluate only certain properties of the triple (t, a, t0).","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"We instead model (t, a, t0) as an arbitrary graph that includes dependency links among the words of each sentence as well as arbitrary alignment links between the words of the two sentences.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
This permits non-synchronous and many-to-many alignments.,"{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"The only hard constraint we impose is that the dependency links within each sentence must constitute a valid monolingual parse—a directed projective spanning tree.1 Given the two sentences w, w0, our probability distribution over possible graphs considers local features of the parses, the alignment, and both jointly.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, we learn what local syntactic configurations tend to occur in each language and how they correspond across languages.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"As a result, we might learn that parses are “mostly synchronous,” but that there are some systematic cross-linguistic 1Non-projective parsing would also be possible. divergences and some instances of sloppy (nonparallel or inexact) translation.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"Our model is thus a form of quasi-synchronous grammar (QG) (Smith and Eisner, 2006a).","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"In that paper, QG was applied to word alignment and has since found applications in question answering (Wang et al., 2007), paraphrase detection (Das and Smith, 2009), and machine translation (Gimpel and Smith, 2009).","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
All the models in this paper are conditioned on the source tree t0.,"{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"Conditionally-trained models of adaptation and projection also condition on the target string w and its alignment a to w0 and thus have the form p(t  |w, w0, t0, a); the unsupervised, generative projection models in §5 have the form p(w, t, a  |w0, t0).","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"The score s of a given tuple of trees, words, and alignment can thus be written as a dot product of weights w with features f and g: � wjgj(t,t0,a,w,w0) + j The features f look only at target words and dependencies.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"In the conditional models of §3 and §6, these features are those of an edge-factored dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005).","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"In the generative models of §5, f has the form of a dependency model with valence (Klein and Manning, 2004).","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"All models, for instance, have a feature template that considers the parts of speech of a potential parent-child relation.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to benefit from the source language, we also need to include bilingual features g. When scoring a candidate target dependency link from word x → y, these features consider the relationship of their corresponding source words x0 and y0.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
(The correspondences are determined by the alignment a.),"{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"For instance, the source tree t0 may contain the link x0 → y0, which would cause a feature for monotonic projection to fire for the x → y edge.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"If, on the other hand, y0 → x0 E t0, a head-swapping feature fires.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"

"Similar features fire when x0 and y0 are in grandparent-grandchild, sibling, c-command, or none-of-the above relationships, or when y aligns to NULL.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"These alignment classes are called configurations (Smith and Eisner, 2006a, and following).","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"
"When training is conditioned on the target words (see §3 and §6 below), we conjoin these configuration features with the part of speech and coarse part of speech of one or both of the source and target words, i.e. the feature template has from one to four tags.","{'title': '2 Form of the Model', 'number': '2'}"

"To test our handling of QG features, we performed experiments in which training saw the correct parse trees in both source and target domains, and the mapping between them was simple and regular.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"We also performed experiments where the source trees were replaced by the noisy output of a trained parser, making the mapping more complex and harder to learn.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"We used the subset of the Penn Treebank from the CoNLL 2007 shared task and converted it to dependency representation while varying two parameters: (1) CoNLL vs. Prague coordination style (Figure 1), and (2) preposition the head vs. the child of its nominal object.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"We trained an edge-factored dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005) on “source” domain data that followed one set of dependency conventions.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"

"We can thus measure the contribution of adaptation loss alone, and the combined loss of imperfect source-domain parsing with adaptation (Table 1).","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"When no target domain trees are available, we simply have the performance of the source domain parser on this out-of-domain data.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
Training a target-domain parser on as few as 10 sentences shows substantial improvements in accuracy.,"{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"In the “gold” conditions, where the target parser starts with perfect source trees, accuracy approaches 100%; in the realistic “parse” conditions, where the target-domain parser gets noisy source-domain parses, the improvements are quite significant but approach a lower ceiling imposed by the performance of the source parser.2 The adaptation problem in this section is a simple proof of concept of the QG approach; however, more complex and realistic adaptation problems exist.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
Monolingual adaptation is perhaps most obviously useful when the source parser is a blackbox or rule-based system or is trained on unavailable data.,"{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"One might still want to use such a parser in some new context, which might require new data or a new annotation standard.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
We are also interested in scenarios where we want to avoid expensive retraining on large reannotated treebanks.,"{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
We would like a linguist to be able to annotate a few trees according to a hypothesized theory and then quickly use QG adaptation to get a parser for that theory.,"{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
One example would be adapting a constituency parser to produce dependency parses.,"{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"We have concentrated here on adapting between two dependency parse styles, in order to line up with the cross-lingual tasks to which we now turn.","{'title': '3 Adaptation', 'number': '3'}"
"As in the adaptation scenario above, many syntactic structures can be transferred from one language to another.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"In this section, we evaluate the extent of this direct projection on a small handannotated corpus.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"

"Finally, in §6,we show how QG features can augment a target-language parser trained on a small set of labeled trees.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"For syntactic annotation projection to work at all, we must hypothesize, or observe, that at least some syntactic structures are preserved in translation.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"Hwa et al. (2005) have called this intuition the Direct Correspondence Assumption (DCA, with slight notational changes): Given a pair of sentences w and w' that are translations of each other with syntactic structure t and t', if nodes x' and y' of t' are aligned with nodes x and y of t, respectively, and if syntactic relationship R(x', y') holds in t', then R(x, y) holds in t. The validity of this assumption clearly depends on the node-to-node alignment of the two trees.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"We again work in a dependency framework, where syntactic nodes are simply lexical items.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
This allows us to use existing work on word alignment.,"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
Hwa et al. (2005) tested the DCA under idealized conditions by obtaining hand-corrected dependency parse trees of a few hundred sentences of Spanish-English and Chinese-English bitext.,"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
They also used human-produced word alignments.,"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"Since their word alignments could be many-tomany, they gave a heuristic Direct Projection Algorithm (DPA) for resolving them into component dependency relations.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"It should be noted that this process introduced empty words into the projected target language tree and left words that are unaligned to English detached from the tree; as a result, they measured performance in dependency Fscore rather than accuracy.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"With manual English parses and word alignments, this DPA achieved 36.8% F-score in Spanish and 38.1% in Chinese.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"With Collins-model English parses and GIZA++ word alignments, F-score was 33.9% for Spanish and 26.3% for Chinese.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
Compare this to the Spanish attach-left baseline of 31.0% and the Chinese attach-right baselines of 35.9%.,"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
These discouragingly low numbers led them to write languagespecific transformation rules to fix up the projected trees.,"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"After these rules were applied to the projections of automatic English parses, F-score was 65.7% for English and 52.4% for Chinese.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"While these F-scores were low, it is useful to look at a subset of the alignment: dependencies projected across one-to-one alignments before the heuristic fix-ups had a much higher precision, if lower recall, than Hwa et al.’s final results.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"Using Hwa et al.’s data, we calculated that the precision of projection to Spanish and Chinese via these one-to-one links was ≈ 65% (Table 2).","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
There is clearly more information in these direct links than one would think from the F-scores.,"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"To exploit this information, however, we need to overcome the problems of (1) learning from partial trees, when not all target words are attached, and (2) learning in the presence of the still considerable noise in the projected one-to-one dependencies—e.g., at least 28% error for Spanish non-punctuation dependencies.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
What does this noise consist of?,"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
"Some errors reflect fairly arbitrary annotation conventions in treebanks, e.g. should the auxiliary verb govern the main verb or vice versa.","{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
(Examples like this suggest that the projection problem contains the adaptation problem above.),"{'title': '4 Cross-Lingual Projection: Background', 'number': '4'}"
