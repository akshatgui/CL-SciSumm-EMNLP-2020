"This paper describes TextTiling, an algorithm for partitioning expository texts into coherent multi-paragraph discourse units which reflect the subtopic structure of the texts.",{}
The algorithm uses domain-independent lexical frequency and distribution information to recognize the interactions of multiple simultaneous themes.,{}
Two fully-implemented versions of the algorithm are described and shown to produce segmentation that corresponds well to human judgments of the major subtopic boundaries of thirteen lengthy texts.,{}
The structure of expository texts can be characterized as a sequence of subtopical discussions that occur in the context of a few main topic discussions.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, a popular science text called Stargazers, whose main topic is the existence of life on earth and other planets, can be described as consisting of the following subdiscussions (numbers indicate paragraph numbers): Subtopic structure is sometimes marked in technical texts by headings and subheadings which divide the text into coherent segments; Brown & Yule (1983:140) state that this kind of division is one of the most basic in discourse.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"

Skorochod'ko (1972) suggests discovering a text's structure by dividing it up into sentences and seeing how much word overlap appears among the sentences.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"The overlap forms a kind of intra-structure; fully connected graphs might indicate dense discussions of a topic, while long spindly chains of connectivity might indicate a sequential account (see Figure 1).","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
The central idea is that of defining the structure of a text as a function of the connectivity patterns of the terms that comprise it.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"

"This assumption, as will be seen, is not always valid, but is nevertheless quite useful.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"This theoretical stance bears a close resemblance to Chafe's notion of The Flow Model of discourse (Chafe 1979), in description of which he writes (pp 179-180): Our data.., suggest that as a speaker moves from focus to focus (or from thought to thought) there are certain points at which there may be a more or less radical change in space, time, character configuration, event structure, or, even, world.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"... At points where all of these change in a maximal way, an episode boundary is strongly present.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"But often one or another will change considerably while others will change less radically, and all kinds of varied interactions between these several factors are possible.2 Although Chafe's work concerns narrative text, the same kind of observation applies to expository text.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
The TextTiling algorithms are designed to recognize episode boundaries by determining where thematic components like those listed by Chafe change in a maximal way.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Many researchers have studied the patterns of occurrence of characters, setting, time, and the other thematic factors that Chafe mentions, usually in the context of narrative.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"In contrast, I attempt to determine where a relatively large set of active themes changes simultaneously, regardless of the type of thematic factor.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"This is especially important in expository text in which the subject matter tends to structure the discourse more so than characters, setting, etc.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, in the Stargazers text, a discussion of continental movement, shoreline acreage, and habitability gives way to a discussion of binary and unary star systems.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
This is not so much a change in setting or character as a change in subject matter.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Therefore, to recognize where the subtopic changes occur, I make use of lexical cohesion relations (Halliday & Hasan 1976) in a manner similar to that suggested by Skorochod'ko.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Morris and Hirst's pioneering work on computing discourse structure from lexical relations (Morris & Hirst 1991), (Morris 1988) is a precursor to the work reported on here.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Influenced by Halliday & Hasan's (1976) theory of lexical coherence, Morris developed an algorithm that finds chains of related terms via a comprehensive thesaurus (Roget's Fourth Edition).3 For example, the 2Interestingly, Chafe arrived at the Flow Model after working extensively with, and then becoming dissatisfied with, a hierarchical model of paragraph structure like that of Longacre (1979). words residential and apartment both index the same thesaural category and can thus be considered to be in a coherence relation with one another.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"The chains are used to structure texts according to the attentional/intentional theory of discourse structure (Grosz Sidner 1986), and the extent of the chains correspond to the extent of a segment.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
The algorithm also incorporates the notion of &quot;chain returns&quot; โ repetition of terms after a long hiatus โ to close off an intention that spans over a digression.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Since the Morris St Hirst (1991) algorithm attempts to discover attentional/intentional structure, their goals are different than those of TextTiling.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Specifically, the discourse structure they attempt to discover is hierarchical and more fine-grained than that discussed here.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
Thus their model is not set up to take advantage of the fact that multiple simultaneous chains might occur over the same intention.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Furthermore, chains tend to overlap one another extensively in long texts.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Figure 2 shows the distribution, by sentence number, of selected terms from the Stargazers text.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
The first two terms have fairly uniform distribution and so should not be expected to provide much information about the divisions of the discussion.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"

From the diagram it is evident that simply looking for chains of repeated terms is not sufficient for determining subtopic breaks.,"{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Even combining terms that are closely related semantically into single chains is insufficient, since often several different themes are active in the same segment.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, sentences 37 - 51 contain dense interaction among the terms move, continent, shoreline, time, species, and life, and all but the latter occur only in this region.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"However, it is the case that the interlinked terms of sentences 57 - 71 (space, star, binary, trinary, astronomer, orbit) are closely related semantically, assuming the appropriate senses of the terms have been determined.","{'title': 'THE DISCOURSE MODEL', 'number': '2'}"
"Many researchers (e.g., Halliday St Hasan (1976), Tannen (1989), Walker (1991)) have noted that term repetition is a strong cohesion indicator.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"I have found in this work that term repetition alone is a very useful indicator of subtopic structure, when analyzed in terms of multiple simultaneous information threads.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
This section describes two algorithms for discovering subtopic structure using term repetition as a lexical cohesion indicator.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"The first method compares, for a given window size, each pair of adjacent blocks of text according to how similar they are lexically.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"This method assumes that the more similar two blocks of text are, the more likely it is that the current subtopic continues, and, conversely, if two adjacent blocks of text are dissimilar, this implies a change in subtopic flow.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"The second method, an extension of Morris Si Hirst's (1991) approach, keeps track of active chains of repeated terms, where membership in a chain is determined by location in the text.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
The method determines subtopic flow by recording where in the discourse the bulk of one set of chains ends and a new set of chains begins.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
The core algorithm has three main parts: Tokenization refers to the division of the input text into individual lexical units.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"For both versions of the algorithm, the text is subdivided into psuedosentences of a pre-defined size w (a parameter of the algorithm) rather than actual syntactically-determined sentences, thus circumventing normalization problems.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
For the purposes of the rest of the discussion these groupings of tokens will be referred to as token-seguences.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"In practice, setting w to 20 tokens per token-sequence works best for many texts.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"The morphologically-analyzed token is stored in a table along with a record of the tokensequence number it occurred in, and how frequently it appeared in the token-sequence.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
A record is also kept of the locations of the paragraph breaks within the text.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
Closed-class and other very frequent words are eliminated from the analysis.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"After tokenization, the next step is the comparison of adjacent pairs of blocks of token-sequences for overall lexical similarity.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
Another important parameter for the algorithm is the blocksize: the number of tokensequences that are grouped together into a block to be compared against an adjacent group of token-sequences.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"This value, labeled k, varies slightly from text to text; as a heuristic it is the average paragraph length (in token-sequences).","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"In practice, a value of k = 6 works well for many texts.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"Actual paragraphs are not used because their lengths can be highly irregular, leading to unbalanced comparisons.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"Similarity values are computed for every tokensequence gap number; that is, a score is assigned to token-sequence gap i corresponding to how similar the token-sequences from token-sequence iโk through i are to the token-sequences from i +1 to i+ k +1.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
Note that this moving window approach means that each tokensequence appears in k * 2 similarity computations.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"Similarity between blocks is calculated by a cosine measure: given two text blocks b1 and 62, each with k token-sequences, E, uh,b1wi,b2 VE, '4,bl Ent-1 '14,b2 where t ranges over all the terms that have been registered during the tokenization step, and wt,bi is the weight assigned to term t in block 61.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"In this version of the algorithm, the weights on the terms are simply their frequency within the block.4 Thus if the similarity score between two blocks is high, then the blocks have many terms in common.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"This formula yields a score between 0 and 1, inclusive.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"These scores can be plotted, token-sequence number against similarity score.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"However, since similarity is measured between blocks b1 and 62, where b1 spans token-sequences i k through i and 62 spans i + 1 to i + k +1, the measurement's x-axis coordinate falls between token-sequences i and i + 1.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"Rather than plotting a token-sequence number on the x-axis, we plot token-sequence gap number i.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
The plot is smoothed with average smoothing; in practice one round of average smoothing with a window size of three works best for most texts.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
Boundaries are determined by changes in the sequence of similarity scores.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"The token-sequence gap numbers are ordered according to how steeply the slopes of the plot are to either side of the token-sequence gap, rather than by their absolute similarity score.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"For a given token-sequence gap i, the algorithm looks at the scores of the token-sequence gaps to the left of i as long are their values are increasing.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"When the values to the left peak out, the difference between the score at the peak and the score at i is recorded.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
The same procedure takes place with the token-sequence gaps to the right of i; their scores are examined as long as they continue to rise.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
The relative height of the peak to the right of i is added to the relative height of the peak to the left.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
(A gap occurring at a peak will have a score of zero since neither of its neighbors is higher than it.),"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"These new scores, called depth scores, corresponding to how sharp a change occurs on both sides of the tokensequence gap, are then sorted.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"Segment boundaries are assigned to the token-sequence gaps with the largest corresponding scores, adjusted as necessary to correspond to true paragraph breaks.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
A proviso check is done that prevents assignment of very close adjacent segment boundaries.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
Currently there must be at least three intervening token-sequences between boundaries.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
This helps control for the fact that many texts have spurious header information and single-sentence paragraphs.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"The algorithm must determine how many segments to assigned to a document, since every paragraph is a potential segment boundary.","{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
Any attempt to make an absolute cutoff is problematic since there would need to be some correspondence to the document style and length.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
A cutoff based on a particular valley depth is similarly problematic.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
I have devised a method for determining the number of boundaries to assign that scales with the size of the document and is sensitive to the patterns of similarity scores that it produces: the cutoff is a function of the average and standard deviations of the depth scores for the text under analysis.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
Currently a boundary is drawn only if the depth score exceeds g โ a/2.,"{'title': 'ALGORITHMS FOR DISCOVERING SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE', 'number': '3'}"
"One way to evaluate these segmentation algorithms is to compare against judgments made by human readers, another is to compare the algorithms against texts premarked by authors, and a third way is to see how well the results improve a computational task.","{'title': 'EVALUATION', 'number': '4'}"
"This section compares the algorithm against reader judgments, since author markups are fallible and are usually applied to text types that this algorithm is not designed for, and Hearst (1994) shows how to use TextTiles in a task (although it does not show whether or not the results of the algorithms used here are better than some other algorithm with similar goals).","{'title': 'EVALUATION', 'number': '4'}"

"However, it isn't clear how useful this significance information is, since a simple majority does not provide overwhelming proof about the objective reality of the subtopic break.","{'title': 'EVALUATION', 'number': '4'}"
"Since readers often disagree about where to draw a boundary marking for a topic shift, one can only use the general trends as a basis from which to compare different algorithms.","{'title': 'EVALUATION', 'number': '4'}"
"Since the goals of TextTiling are better served by algorithms that produce more rather than fewer boundaries, I set the cutoff for &quot;true&quot; boundaries to three rather than four judges per paragraph.6 The remaining gaps are considered nonboundaries.","{'title': 'EVALUATION', 'number': '4'}"

These scores appear in Table 1 (results at 33% are also shown for comparison purposes).,"{'title': 'Results', 'number': '5'}"

This work does not incorporate the notion of multiple simultaneous themes but instead just tries to find breaks in semantic similarity among a small number of terms.,"{'title': 'SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK', 'number': '6'}"
A good strategy may be to substitute this kind of similarity information for term repetition in algorithms like those described here.,"{'title': 'SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK', 'number': '6'}"
"Another possibility would be to use semantic similarity information as computed in Schiitze (1993), Resnik (1993), or Dagan et al. (1993).","{'title': 'SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK', 'number': '6'}"
"The use of discourse cues for detection of segment boundaries and other discourse purposes has been extensively researched, although predominantly on spoken text (see Hirschberg & Litman (1993) for a summary of six research groups' treatments of 64 cue words).","{'title': 'SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK', 'number': '6'}"
It is possible that incorporation of such information may provide a relatively simple way improve the cases where the algorithm is off by one paragraph.,"{'title': 'SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK', 'number': '6'}"
