"In this paper, we present and compare various single-word based alignment models for statistical machine translation.",{}
"We discuss the five IBM alignment models, the Hidden- Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques and various modifications.",{}
We present different methods to combine alignments.,{}
As evaluation criterion we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment.,{}
"We show that models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model lead to significantly better results than the simple models IBM-1 or IBM-2, which are not able to go beyond zero-order dependencies.",{}
In statistical machine translation we set up a statistical translation model Pr(fillef) which describes the relationship between a source language (SL) string f and a target language (TL) string ef.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

An alignment Ã¢ for which holds = arg max Pr(fil for a specific model is called Viterbi alignment of this model.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"So far, no well established evaluation criterion exists in the literature for these alignment models.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For various reasons (nonunique reference translation, over-fitting and statistically deficient models) it seems hard to use training/test perplexity as in language modeling.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Using translation quality is problematic, as translation quality is not well defined and as there are additional influences such as language model or decoder properties.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We propose in this paper to measure the quality of an alignment model using the quality of the Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced alignment.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This allows an automatic evaluation, once a reference alignment has been produced.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In addition, it results in a very precise and reliable evaluation criterion that is well suited to assess various design decisions in modeling and training of statistical alignment models.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper we use the models IBM-1 to IBM-5 from (Brown et al., 1993b) and the Hidden-Markov alignment model (HMM) from (Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2000).","{'title': '2 Models', 'number': '2'}"

The alignment a may contain alignments ai = 0 with the 'empty' word co to account for French words that are not aligned to any English word.,"{'title': '2 Models', 'number': '2'}"

IBM-5 is a reformulation of IBM-4 with a suitably refined alignment model in order to avoid deficiency.,"{'title': '2 Models', 'number': '2'}"
"So the main differences of these models lie in the alignment model (which may be zeroorder or first-order), in the existence of an explicit fertility model and whether the model is deficient or not.","{'title': '2 Models', 'number': '2'}"
"For HMM, IBM-4 and IBM-5 it is straightforward to extend the alignment parameters to include a dependence on the word classes of the words around the alignment position.","{'title': '2 Models', 'number': '2'}"
"In the HMM alignment model we allow for a dependence from the class E = C(ea,_,).","{'title': '2 Models', 'number': '2'}"
"Correspondingly, we can include similar dependencies on French and English word classes in IBM-4 and IBM-5 (Brown et al., 1993b).","{'title': '2 Models', 'number': '2'}"

"Since there is no efficient way in the fertility models IBM-3 to 5 to avoid the explicit summation over all alignments in the EMalgorithm, the counts are collected only over a subset of promising alignments.","{'title': ""3 Training'"", 'number': '3'}"
