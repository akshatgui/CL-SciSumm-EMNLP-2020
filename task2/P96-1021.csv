"The statistical translation model introduced by IBM (Brown et al., 1990) views translation as a noisy channel process.",Experiment/Discussion
"Assume, as we do throughout this paper, that the input language is Chinese and the task is to translate into English.",Experiment/Discussion
"The underlying generative model, shown in Figure 1, contains a stochastic English sentence generator whose output is &quot;corrupted&quot; by the translation channel to produce Chinese sentences.",Experiment/Discussion
"In the IBM system, the language model employs simple n-grams, while the translation model employs several sets of parameters as discussed below.",Experiment/Discussion
"Estimation of the parameters has been described elsewhere (Brown et al., 1993).",Experiment/Discussion
"Translation is performed in the reverse direction from generation, as usual for recognition under generative models.",Experiment/Discussion
"For each Chinese sentence e that is to be translated, the system must attempt to find the English sentence e* such that: In the IBM model, the search for the optimal e* is performed using a best-first heuristic &quot;stack search&quot; similar to A* methods.",Experiment/Discussion
"One of the primary obstacles to making the statistical translation approach practical is slow speed of translation, as performed in A* fashion.",Experiment/Discussion
This price is paid for the robustness that is obtained by using very flexible language and translation models.,Experiment/Discussion
The language model allows sentences of arbitrary order and the translation model allows arbitrary word-order permutation.,Experiment/Discussion
"The models employ no structural constraints, relying instead on probability parameters to assign low probabilities to implausible sentences.",Experiment/Discussion
"This exhaustive space, together with massive number of parameters, permits greater modeling accuracy.",Experiment/Discussion
"But while accuracy is enhanced, translation efficiency suffers due to the lack of structure in the hypothesis space.",Experiment/Discussion
The translation channel is characterized by two sets of parameters: translation and alignment probabilities.',Experiment/Discussion
"The translation probabilities describe lexical substitution, while alignment probabilities describe word-order permutation.",Experiment/Discussion
"The key problem is that the formulation of alignment probabilities a(il j, V, T) permits the Chinese word in position j of a length-T sentence to map to any position i of a length-V English sentence.",Experiment/Discussion
"So VT alignments are possible, yielding an exponential space with correspondingly slow search times.",Experiment/Discussion
Note there are no explicit linguistic grammars in the IBM channel model.,Experiment/Discussion
"Useful methods do exist for incorporating constraints fed in from other preprocessing modules, and some of these modules do employ linguistic grammars.",Experiment/Discussion
"For instance, we previously reported a method for improving search times in channel translation models that exploits bracketing information (Wu and Ng, 1995).",Experiment/Discussion
"If any brackets for the Chinese sentence can be supplied as additional input information, produced for example by a preprocessing stage, a modified version of the A*based algorithm can follow the brackets to guide the search heuristically.",Experiment/Discussion
This strategy appears to produces moderate improvements in search speed and slightly better translations.,Experiment/Discussion
"Such linguistic-preprocessing techniques could 'Various models have been constructed by the IBM team (Brown et al., 1993).",Experiment/Discussion
"This description corresponds to one of the simplest ones, &quot;Model 2&quot;; search costs for the more complex models are correspondingly higher. also be used with the new model described below, but the issue is independent of our focus here.",Experiment/Discussion
In this paper we address the underlying assumptions of core channel model itself which does not directly use linguistic structure.,Experiment/Discussion
"A slightly different model is employed for a word alignment application by Dagan et al. (Dagan, Church, and Gale, 1993).",Experiment/Discussion
"Instead of alignment probabilities, offset probabilities o(k) are employed, where k is essentially the positional distance between the English words aligned to two adjacent Chinese words: wherepr e v is the position of the immediately preceding Chinese word and N is a constant that normalizes for average sentence lengths in different languages.",Experiment/Discussion
The motivation is that words that are close to each other in the Chinese sentence should tend to be close in the English sentence as well.,Experiment/Discussion
"The size of the parameter set is greatly reduced from the x x (TI x I VI parameters of the alignment probabilities, down to a small set of jkl parameters.",Experiment/Discussion
"However, the search space remains the same.",Experiment/Discussion
The A*-style stack-decoding approach is in some ways a carryover from the speech recognition architectures that inspired the channel translation model.,Experiment/Discussion
"It has proven highly effective for speech recognition in both accuracy and speed, where the search space contains no order variation since the acoustic and text streams can be assumed to be linearly aligned.",Experiment/Discussion
"But in contrast, for translation models the stack search alone does not adequately compensate for the combinatorially more complex space that results from permitting arbitrary order variations.",Experiment/Discussion
"Indeed, the stack-decoding approach remains impractically slow for translation, and has not achieved the same kind of speed as for speech recognition.",Experiment/Discussion
"The model we describe in this paper, like Dagan et al. 's model, encourages related words to stay together, and reduces the number of parameters used to describe word-order variation.",Experiment/Discussion
"But more importantly, it makes structural assumptions that eliminate large portions of the space of alignments, based on linguistic motivatations.",Experiment/Discussion
This greatly reduces the search space and makes possible a polynomial-time optimization algorithm.,Experiment/Discussion
The new translation model is based on the recently introduced bilingual language modeling approach.,Experiment/Discussion
"Specifically, the model employs a bracketing transduction grammar or BTG (Wu, 1995a), which is a special case of inversion transduction grammars or ITGs (Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995b; Wu, 1995d).",Experiment/Discussion
"These formalisms were originally developed for the purpose of parallel corpus annotation, with applications for bracketing, alignment, and segmentation.",Experiment/Discussion
This paper finds they are also useful for the translation system itself.,Experiment/Discussion
In this section we summarize the main properties of BTGs and ITGs.,Experiment/Discussion
"An ITG consists of context-free productions where terminal symbols come in couples, for example x I y, where x is a Chinese word and y is an English translation of x.2 Any parse tree thus generates two strings, one on the Chinese stream and one on the English stream.",Experiment/Discussion
"Thus, the tree: An additional mechanism accommodates a conservative degree of word-order variation between the two languages.",Experiment/Discussion
"With each production of the grammar is associated either a straight orientation or an inverted orientation, respectively denoted as follows:",Experiment/Discussion
"In the case of a production with straight orientation, the right-hand-side symbols are visited leftto-right for both the Chinese and English streams.",Experiment/Discussion
"But for a production with inverted orientation, the 2 Readers of the papers cited above should note that we have switched the roles of English and Chinese here, which helps simplify the presentation of the new translation algorithm. right-hand-side symbols are visited left-to-right for Chinese and right-to-left for English.",Experiment/Discussion
"Thus, the tree: In the special case of BTGs which are employed in the model presented below, there is only one undifferentiated nonterminal category (aside from the start symbol).",Experiment/Discussion
"Designating this category A, this means all non-lexical productions are of one of these two forms: The degree of word-order flexibility is the critical point.",Experiment/Discussion
"BTGs make a favorable trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness: constraints are strong enough to allow algorithms to operate efficiently, but without so much loss of expressiveness as to hinder useful translation.",Experiment/Discussion
"We summarize here; details are given elsewhere (Wu, 1995b).",Experiment/Discussion
"With regard to efficiency, Figure 2 demonstrates the kind of reduction that BTGs obtain in the space of possible alignments.",Experiment/Discussion
"The number of possible alignments, compared against the unrestricted case where any English word may align to any Chinese position, drops off dramatically for strings longer than four words.",Experiment/Discussion
(This table makes the simplification of counting only 1-1 matchings and is merely representative.),Experiment/Discussion
"With regard to expressiveness, we believe that almost all variation in the order of arguments in a syntactic frame can be accommodated.3 Syntactic frames generally contain four or fewer subconstituents.",Experiment/Discussion
"Figure 2 shows that for the case of four subconstituents, BTGs permit 22 out of the 24 possible alignments.",Experiment/Discussion
"The only prohibited arrangements are &quot;inside-out&quot; transformations (Wu, 1995b), which we have been unable to find any examples of in our corpus.",Experiment/Discussion
"Moreover, extremely distorted alignments can be handled by BTGs (Wu, 1995c), without resorting to the unrestricted-alignment model.",Experiment/Discussion
The translation expressiveness of BTGs is by no means perfect.,Experiment/Discussion
They are nonetheless proving very useful in applications and are substantially more feasible than previous models.,Experiment/Discussion
"In our previous corpus analysis applications, any expressiveness limitations were easily tolerable since degradation was graceful.",Experiment/Discussion
"In the present translation application, any expressiveness limitation simply means that certain translations are not considered.",Experiment/Discussion
"For the remainder of the paper, we take advantage of a convenient normal-form theorem (Wu, 1995a) that allows us to assume without loss of generality that the BTG only contains the binary-branching form for the non-lexical productions.4",Experiment/Discussion
A first approach to improving the translation search is to limit the allowed word alignment patterns to those permitted by a BTG.,Experiment/Discussion
"In this case, Equation (2) is kept as the objective function and the translation channel can be parameterized similarly to Dagan ei al. (Dagan, Church, and Gale, 1993).",Experiment/Discussion
The effect of the BTG restriction is just to constrain the shapes of the word-order distortions.,Experiment/Discussion
"A BTG rather than ITG is used since, as we discussed earlier, pure channel translation models operate without explicit grammars, providing no constituent categories around which a more sophisticated ITG could be structured.",Experiment/Discussion
"But the structural constraints of the BTG can improve search efficiency, even without differentiated constituent categories.",Experiment/Discussion
"Just as in the baseline system, we rely on the language and translation models to take up the slack in place of an explicit grammar.",Experiment/Discussion
"In this approach, an 0(T7) algorithm similar to the one described later can be constructed to replace A* search.",Experiment/Discussion
However we do not feel it is worth preserving offset (or alignment or distortion) parameters simply for the sake of preserving the original translation channel model.,Experiment/Discussion
These parameterizations were only intended to crudely model word-order variation.,Experiment/Discussion
"Instead, the BTG itself can be used directly to probabilistically rank alternative alignments, as described next.",Experiment/Discussion
"The second possibility is to use a stochastic bracketing transduction grammar (SBTG) in the channel model, replacing the translation model altogether.",Experiment/Discussion
"In a SBTG, a probability is associated with each production.",Experiment/Discussion
"Thus for the normal-form BTG, we have: The translation lexicon is encoded in productions of the third kind.",Experiment/Discussion
The latter two kinds of productions allow words of either Chinese or English to go unmatched.,Experiment/Discussion
"The SBTG assigns a probability Pr(c, e, q) to all generable trees q and sentence-pairs.",Experiment/Discussion
In principle it can be used as the translation channel model by normalizing with Pr(e) and integrating out Pr(q) to give Pr(cle) in Equation (2).,Experiment/Discussion
"In practice, a strong language model makes this unnecessary, so we can instead optimize the simpler Viterbi approximation To complete the picture we add a bigram model get—let = g(e.i 1e3_ Pr(e).",Experiment/Discussion
"1) for the English language model Offset, alignment, or distortion parameters are entirely eliminated.",Experiment/Discussion
"A large part of the implicit function of such parameters—to prevent alignments where too many frame arguments become separated—is rendered unnecessary by the BTG's structural constraints, which prohibit many such configurations altogether.",Experiment/Discussion
"Another part of the parameters' purpose is subsumed by the SBTG's probabilities all and a0, which can be set to prefer straight or inverted orientation depending on the language pair.",Experiment/Discussion
"As in the original models, the language model heavily influences the remaining ordering decisions.",Experiment/Discussion
"Matters are complicated by the presence of the bigram model in the objective function (which wordalignment models, as opposed to translation models, do not need to deal with).",Experiment/Discussion
"As in our word-alignment model, the translation algorithm optimizes Equation (4) via dynamic programming, similar to chart parsing (Earley, 1970) but with a probabilistic objective function as for HMMs (Viterbi, 1967).",Experiment/Discussion
"But unlike the word-alignment model, to accommodate the bigram model we introduce indexes in the recurrence not only on subtrees over the source Chinese string, but also on the delimiting words of the target English substrings.",Experiment/Discussion
Another feature of the algorithm is that segmentation of the Chinese input sentence is performed in parallel with the translation search.,Experiment/Discussion
"Conventional architectures for Chinese NLP generally attempt to identify word boundaries as a preprocessing stage.5 Whenever the segmentation preprocessor prematurely commits to an inappropriate segmentation, difficulties are created for later stages.",Experiment/Discussion
"This problem is particularly acute for translation, since the decision as to whether to regard a sequence as a single unit depends on whether its components can be translated compositionally.",Experiment/Discussion
This in turn often depends on what the target language is.,Experiment/Discussion
"In other words, the Chinese cannot be appropriately segmented except with respect to the target language of translation—a task-driven definition of correct segmentation.",Experiment/Discussion
The algorithm is given below.,Experiment/Discussion
"A few remarks about the notation used: cs,.t denotes the subsequence of Chinese tokens cs+1, cs+2, , ct. We use E(s..t) to denote the set of English words that are translations the Chinese word created by taking all tokens in c, t together.",Experiment/Discussion
"E(s, t) denotes the set of English words that are translations of any of the Chinese words anywhere within e, ..t. Note also that we assume the explicit sentence-start and sentenceend tokens co = <s> and cT+1 = <Is>, which makes the algorithm description more parsimonious.",Experiment/Discussion
"Finally, the argmax operator is generalized to vector notation to accomodate multiple indices.",Experiment/Discussion
"= 0 if etyz > Olslyz and 4yz > 451)tyz where of the parse tree to qo =_- (-1,T— 1, <s>, </ s>).",Experiment/Discussion
"The remaining descendants in the optimal parse tree are then given recursively for any q = (s,t,y, z) by: a probabilistic optimization problem.",Experiment/Discussion
"But perhaps most importantly, our goal is to constrain as tightly as possible the space of possible transduction relationships between two languages with fixed wordorder, making no other language-specific assumptions; we are thus driven to seek a kind of languageuniversal property.",Experiment/Discussion
"In contrast, the ID/LP work was directed at parsing a single language with free word-order.",Experiment/Discussion
"As a consequence, it would be necessary to enumerate a specific set of linear-precedence (LP) relations for the language, and moreover the immediate-dominance (ID) productions would typically be more complex than binary-branching.",Experiment/Discussion
"This significantly increases time complexity, compared to our BTG model.",Experiment/Discussion
"Although it is not mentioned in their paper, the time complexity for ID/LP parsing rises exponentially with the length of production right-hand-sides, due to the number of permutations.",Experiment/Discussion
"ITGs avoid this with their restriction to inversions, rather than permutations, and BTGs further minimize the grammar size.",Experiment/Discussion
We have also confirmed empirically that our models would not be feasible under general permutations.,Experiment/Discussion
Assume the number of translations per word is bounded by some constant.,Experiment/Discussion
"Then the maximum size of E(s,t) is proportional to t — s. The asymptotic time complexity for the translation algorithm is thus bounded by 0(T7).",Experiment/Discussion
"Note that in practice, actual performance is improved by the sparseness of the translation matrix.",Experiment/Discussion
"An interesting connection has been suggested to direct parsing for ID/LP grammars (Shieber, 1984), in which word-order variations would be accommodated by the parser, and related ideas for generation of free word-order languages in the TAG framework (Joshi, 1987).",Experiment/Discussion
Our work differs from the ID/LP work in several important respects.,Experiment/Discussion
"First, we are not merely parsing, but translating with a bigram language model.",Experiment/Discussion
"Also, of course, we are dealing with",Experiment/Discussion
The algorithm above was tested in the SILC translation system.,Experiment/Discussion
"The translation lexicon was largely constructed by training on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, which consists of governmental transcripts.",Experiment/Discussion
"The corpus was sentence-aligned statistically (Wu, 1994); Chinese words and collocations were extracted (Fung and Wu, 1994; Wu and Fung, 1994); then translation pairs were learned via an EM procedure (Wu and Xia, 1995).",Experiment/Discussion
"The resulting English vocabulary is approximately 6,500 words and the Chinese vocabulary is approximately 5,500 words, with a many-to-many translation mapping averaging 2.25 Chinese translations per English word.",Experiment/Discussion
"Due to the unsupervised training, the translation lexicon contains noise and is only at about 86% percent weighted precision.",Experiment/Discussion
"With regard to accuracy, we merely wish to demonstrate that for statistical MT, accuracy is not significantly compromised by substituting our efficient optimization algorithm.",Experiment/Discussion
It is not our purpose here to argue that accuracy can be increased with our model.,Experiment/Discussion
"No morphological processing has been used to correct the output, and until now we have only been testing with a bigram model trained on extremely limited samples.",Experiment/Discussion
