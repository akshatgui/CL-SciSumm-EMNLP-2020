One of the motivations of our work is to achieve desirable trade-off between model capability and search space through the use of the so called wellformed dependency structures in rule representation.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"As such, dependency trees are a desirable prior model of the target sentence.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We restrict ourselves to the so-called well-formed target dependency structures based on the following considerations.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In (Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005), there is no restriction on dependency treelets used in transfer rules except for the size limit.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This may result in a high dimensionality in hypothesis representation and make it hard to employ shared structures for efficient dynamic programming.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In (Galley et al., 2004), rules contain NT slots and combination is only allowed at those slots.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Furthermore, shared structures can be easily defined based on the labels of the slots.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"In this paper, we use well-formed dependency structures to handle the coverage of non-constituent rules.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The well-formedness of the dependency structures enables efficient decoding through dynamic programming.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A string-to-dependency grammar G is a 4-tuple G =< R, X, Tf, Te >, where R is a set of transfer rules.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"

"A string-to-dependency transfer rule R E R is a 4-tuple R =< 5f, 5e, D, A >, where 5f E (Tf U {X})+ is a source string, 5e E (Te U {X})+ is a target string, D represents the dependency structure for 5e, and A is the alignment between 5f and 5e.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Non-terminal alignments in A must be one-to-one.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to exclude undesirable structures, we only allow 5e whose dependency structure D is well-formed, which we will define below.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition, the same well-formedness requirement will be applied to partial decoding results.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, we will be able to employ shared structures to merge multiple partial results.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Based on the results in previous work (DeNeefe et al., 2007), we want to keep two kinds of dependency structures.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"In one kind, we keep dependency trees with a sub-root, where all the children of the sub-root are complete.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We call them fixed dependency structures because the head is known or fixed.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"In the other, we keep dependency structures of sibling nodes of a common head, but the head itself is unspecified or floating.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Each of the siblings must be a complete constituent.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We call them floating dependency structures.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Floating structures can represent many linguistically meaningful non-constituent structures: for example, like the red, a modifier of a noun.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Only those two kinds of dependency structures are well-formed structures in our system.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Furthermore, we operate over well-formed structures in a bottom-up style in decoding.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"However, the description given above does not provide a clear definition on how to combine those two types of structures.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"In the rest of this section, we will provide formal definitions of well-formed structures and combinatory operations over them, so that we can easily manipulate well-formed structures in decoding.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Formal definitions also allow us to easily extend the framework to incorporate a dependency language model in decoding.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Examples will be provided along with the formal definitions.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"

"For example, d4 = 2 means that w4 depends 'We ignore the left hand side here because there is only one non-terminal X.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Of course, this formalism can be extended to have multiple NTs.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Definition 1 A dependency structure di..j is fixed on head h, where h E [i, j], or fixed for short, if and only if it meets the following conditions In addition, we say the category of di..j is (−, h, −), where − means this field is undefined.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"We say the category of di..j is (C, −, −) if j < h, or (−, −, C) otherwise.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"A category is composed of the three fields (A, h, B), where h is used to represent the head, and A and B are designed to model left and right dependents of the head respectively.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
A dependency structure is well-formed if and only if it is either fixed or floating.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We can represent dependency structures with graphs.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Figure 2 shows examples of fixed structures, Figure 3 shows examples of floating structures, and Figure 4 shows ill-formed dependency structures.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
It is easy to verify that the structures in Figures 2 and 3 are well-formed.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
4(a) is ill-formed because boy does not have its child word the in the tree.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
4(b) is ill-formed because it is not a continuous segment.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"As for the example the red mentioned above, it is a well-formed floating dependency structure.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"One of the purposes of introducing floating dependency structures is that siblings having a common parent will become a well-defined entity, although they are not considered a constituent.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We always build well-formed partial structures on the target side in decoding.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Furthermore, we combine partial dependency structures in a way such that we can obtain all possible well-formed but no ill-formed dependency structures during bottom-up decoding.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
The solution is to employ categories introduced above.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Each well-formed dependency structure has a category.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We can apply four combinatory operations over the categories.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"If we can combine two categories with a certain category operation, we can use a corresponding tree operation to combine two dependency structures.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
The category of the combined dependency structure is the result of the combinatory category operations.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We first introduce three meta category operations.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Two of them are unary operations, left raising (LR) and right raising (RR), and one is the binary operation unification (UF).","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"First, the raising operations are used to turn a completed fixed structure into a floating structure.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
It is easy to verify the following theorem according to the definitions.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Therefore we can always raise a fixed structure if we assume it is complete, i.e.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
(1) holds.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Unification is well-defined if and only if we can unify all three elements and the result is a valid fixed or floating category.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, we can unify a fixed structure with a floating structure or two floating structures in the same direction, but we cannot unify two fixed structures.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Next we introduce the four tree operations on dependency structures.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Instead of providing the formal definition, we use figures to illustrate these operations to make it easy to understand.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Figure 1 shows a traditional dependency tree.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Figure 5 shows the four operations to combine partial dependency structures, which are left adjoining (LA), right adjoining (RA), left concatenation (LC) and right concatenation (RC).","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Child and parent subtrees can be combined with adjoining which is similar to the traditional dependency formalism.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We can either adjoin a fixed structure or a floating structure to the head of a fixed structure.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Complete siblings can be combined via concatenation.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"We can concatenate two fixed structures, one fixed structure with one floating structure, or two floating structures in the same direction.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
The flexibility of the order of operation allows us to take adWe use the same names for the operations on categories for the sake of convenience.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
We can easily use the meta category operations to define the four combinatory operations.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
The definition of the operations in the left direction is as follows.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Those in the right direction are similar.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
It is easy to verify the soundness and completeness of category operations based on one-to-one mapping of the conditions in the definitions of corresponding operations on dependency structures and on categories.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Suppose we have a dependency tree for a red apple, where both a and red depend on apple.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"There are two ways to compute the category of this string from the bottom up. cat(Da red apple) = LA(cat(Da),LA(cat(Dred),cat(Dapple))) = LA(LC(cat(Da), cat(Dred)), cat(Dapple)) Based on Theorem 2, it follows that combinatory operation of categories has the confluence property, since the result dependency structure is determined.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Corollary 1 (confluence) The category of a wellformed dependency tree does not depend on the order of category calculation.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"With categories, we can easily track the types of dependency structures and constrain operations in decoding.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, we have a rule with dependency structure find +— X, where X right adjoins to find.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Suppose we have two floating structures2, We can replace X by X2, but not by X1 based on the definition of category operations.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Now we explain how we get the string-todependency rules from training data.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"The procedure is similar to (Chiang, 2007) except that we maintain tree structures on the target side, instead of strings.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"Given sentence-aligned bi-lingual training data, we first use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to generate word level alignment.","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
"We use a statistical CFG parser to parse the English side of the training data, and extract dependency trees with Magerman’s rules (1995).","{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
Then we use heuristic rules to extract transferrules recursively based on the GIZA alignment and the target dependency trees.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"
The rule extraction procedure is as follows.,"{'title': '2 String-to-Dependency Translation', 'number': '2'}"

"Let (Pi,j f , Pm,n e , D1, A) be a valid rule template, and (Pp,q f , Ps,t e , D2, A) a valid phrase alignment, where [p, q] C [i, j], [s, t] C [m, n], D2 is a sub-structure of D1, and at least one word in Pi,j f but not in Pp,q f is aligned.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We create a new valid rule template (P0 f, P0e, D0, A), where we obtain Pf0 by replacing Pp,q f with label X in Pi,j f , and obtain Among all valid rule templates, we collect those that contain at most two NTs and at most seven elements in the source as transfer rules in our system.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Following previous work on hierarchical MT (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), we solve decoding as chart parsing.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
We view target dependency as the hidden structure of source fragments.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The parser scans all source cells in a bottom-up style, and checks matched transfer rules according to the source side.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Once there is a completed rule, we build a larger dependency structure by substituting component dependency structures for corresponding NTs in the target dependency structure of rules.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Hypothesis dependency structures are organized in a shared forest, or AND-OR structures.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"An ANDf aligned to Pm,n e , we mean all words in Pi,j f are either aligned to words in Pm,n e or unaligned, and vice versa.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Furthermore, at least one word in Pi,j structure represents an application of a rule over component OR-structures, and an OR-structure represents a set of alternative AND-structures with the same state.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
A state means a n-tuple that characterizes the information that will be inquired by up-level AND-structures.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Supposing we use a traditional tri-gram language model in decoding, we need to specify the leftmost two words and the rightmost two words in a state.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Since we only have a single NT X in the formalism described above, we do not need to add the NT label in states.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"However, we need to specify one of the three types of the dependency structure: fixed, floating on the left side, or floating on the right side.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
This information is encoded in the category of the dependency structure.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In the next section, we will explain how to extend categories and states to exploit a dependency language model during decoding.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For the dependency tree in Figure 1, we calculate the probability of the tree as follows ×PL(will|find-as-head) ×PL(boy|will, find-as-head) ×PL(the|boy-as-head) ×PR(it|find-as-head) ×PR(interesting|it, find-as-head) Here PT(x) is the probability that word x is the root of a dependency tree.","{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"

"Suppose we use a tri-gram dependency LM, wh-as-head represents wh used as the head, and it is different from wh in the dependency language model.","{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"
The right side probability is similar.,"{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"
"In order to calculate the dependency language model score, or depLM score for short, on the fly for partial hypotheses in a bottom-up decoding, we need to save more information in categories and states.","{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"
"We use a 5-tuple (LF, LN, h, RN, RF) to represent the category of a dependency structure. h represents the head.","{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"
LF and RF represent the farthest two children on the left and right sides respectively.,"{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"
"Similarly, LN and RN represent the nearest two children on the left and right sides respectively.","{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"
The three types of categories are as follows.,"{'title': '3 Dependency Language Model', 'number': '4'}"

Table 1 shows the number of transfer rules extracted from the training data for the tuning and test sets.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
The constraint of well-formed dependency structures greatly reduced the size of the rule set.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"Although the rule size increased a little bit after incorporating dependency structures in rules, the size of string-to-dependency rule set is less than 20% of the baseline rule set size.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
Table 2 shows the BLEU and TER scores on MT04.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"On decoding output, the string-todependency system achieved 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER compared to the baseline hierarchical stringto-string system.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"After 5-gram rescoring, it achieved 1.21 point improvement in BLEU and 1.19 improvement in TER.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
The filtered model does not show improvement on BLEU.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
The filtered string-to-string rules can be viewed the string projection of stringto-dependency rules.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
It means that just using dependency structure does not provide an improvement on performance.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"However, dependency structures allow the use of a dependency LM which gives rise to significant improvement.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"The well-formed dependency structures defined here are similar to the data structures in previous work on mono-lingual parsing (Eisner and Satta, 1999; McDonald et al., 2005).","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"However, here we have fixed structures growing on both sides to exploit various translation fragments learned in the training data, while the operations in mono-lingual parsing were designed to avoid artificial ambiguity of derivation.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
Charniak et al. (2003) described a two-step stringto-CFG-tree translation model which employed a syntax-based language model to select the best translation from a target parse forest built in the first step.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
Only translation probability P(FIE) was employed in the construction of the target forest due to the complexity of the syntax-based LM.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"Since our dependency LM models structures over target words directly based on dependency trees, we can build a single-step system.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
This dependency LM can also be used in hierarchical MT systems using lexicalized CFG trees.,"{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"The use of a dependency LM in MT is similar to the use of a structured LM in ASR (Xu et al., 2002), which was also designed to exploit long-distance relations.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"The depLM is used in a bottom-up style, while SLM is employed in a left-to-right style.","{'title': '6 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"In this paper, we propose a novel string-todependency algorithm for statistical machine translation.","{'title': '7 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '8'}"
"For comparison purposes, we replicated the Hiero system as described in (Chiang, 2005).","{'title': '7 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '8'}"
"Our string-to-dependency system generates 80% fewer rules, and achieves 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER on the decoding output on the NIST 04 Chinese-English evaluation set.","{'title': '7 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '8'}"
Dependency structures provide a desirable platform to employ linguistic knowledge in MT.,"{'title': '7 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '8'}"
"In the future, we will continue our research in this direction to carry out translation with deeper features, for example, propositional structures (Palmer et al., 2005).","{'title': '7 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '8'}"
We believe that the fixed and floating structures proposed in this paper can be extended to model predicates and arguments.,"{'title': '7 Conclusions and Future Work', 'number': '8'}"
