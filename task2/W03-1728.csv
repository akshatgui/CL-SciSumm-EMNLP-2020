"Unlike English text in which sentences are sequences of words delimited by white spaces, in Chinese text, sentences are represented as strings of Chinese characters or hanzi without similar natural delimiters.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"Therefore, the first step in a Chinese language processing task is to identify the sequence of words in a sentence and mark boundaries in appropriate places.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"This may sound simple enough but in reality identifying words in Chinese is a non-trivial problem that has drawn a large body of research in the Chinese language processing community (Fan and Tsai, 1988; Gan et al., 1996; Sproat et al., 1996; Wu, 2003; Xue, 2003).","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
The key to accurate automatic word identification in Chinese lies in the successful resolution of ambiguities and aproper way to handle out-of-vocabulary words.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"The ambiguities in Chinese word segmentation is due to the fact that a hanzi can occur in different word-internal positions (Xue, 2003).","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"Given the proper context, generally provided by the sentence in which it occurs, the position of a hanzi can be determined.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we model the Chinese word segmentation as a hanzi tagging problem and use a machine-learning algorithm to determine the appropriate position for a hanzi.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
There are several reasons why we may expect this approach to work.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"First, Chinese words generally have fewer than four characters.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"As a result, the number of positions is small.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"Second, although each hanzi can in principle occur in all possible positions, not all hanzi behave this way.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
A substantial number of hanzi are distributed in a constrained manner.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"For example, , the plural marker, almost always occurs in the word-final position.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"Finally, although Chinese words cannot be exhaustively listed and new words are bound to occur in naturally occurring text, the same is not true for hanzi.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
The number of hanzi stays fairly constant and we do not generally expect to see new hanzi.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"We represent the positions of a hanzi with four different tags (Table 1): LM for a hanzi that occurs on the left periphery of a word, followed by other hanzi, MM for a hanzi that occurs in the middle of a word, MR for a hanzi that occurs on the right periphery of word, preceded by other hanzi, and LR for hanzi that is a word by itself.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
We call this LMR tagging.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"With this approach, word segmentation is a process where each hanzi is assigned an LMR tag and sequences of hanzi are then converted into sequences of words based on the LMR tags.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"The use of four tags is linguistically intuitive in that LM tags morphemes that are prefixes or stems in the absence of prefixes, MR tags morphemes that are suffixes or stems in the absence of suffixes, MM tags stems with affixes and LR tags stems without affixes.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
"Representing the distributions of hanzi with LMR tags also makes it easy to use machine learning algorithms which has been successfully applied to other tagging problems, such as POS-tagging and IOB tagging used in text chunking.","{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
In this paper we present Chinese word segmentation algorithms based on the socalled LMR tagging.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"
Our LMR taggers are implemented with the Maximum Entropy Markov Model and we then use Transformation-Based Learning to combine the results of the two LMR taggers that scan the input in opposite directions.,"{'title': 'Abstract 1 Segmentation as Tagging', 'number': '1'}"

Our algorithm consists of two parts.,"{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"We first implement two Maximum Entropy taggers, one of which scans the input from left to right and the other scans the input from right to left.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
Then we implement a Transformation Based Algorithm to combine the results of the two taggers.,"{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
The Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) has been successfully used in some tagging problems.,"{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
MEMM models are capable of utilizing a large set of features that generative models cannot use.,"{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"On the other hand, MEMM approaches scan the input incrementally as generative models do.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"The Maximum Entropy Markov Model used in POS-tagging is described in detail in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and the LMR tagger here uses the same probability model.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"The probability model is defined over , where is the set of possible contexts or ”histories” and is the set of possible tags.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"The model’s joint probability of a history and a tag is defined as where is a normalization constant, are the model parameters and are known as features, where .","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"Each feature has a corresponding parameter , that effectively serves as a ”weight” of this feature.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"In the training process, given a sequence of characters and their LMR tags as training data, the purpose is to determine the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the training data using : The success of the model in tagging depends to a large extent on the selection of suitable features.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"Given , a feature must encode information that helps to predict .","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"

"It is noted in (Lafferty et al., 2001) that non-generative finite-state models, MEMM models included, share a weakness which they call the Label Bias Problem (LBP): a transition leaving a given state compete only against all other transitions in the model.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
They proposed Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as a solution to address this problem.,"{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
A partial solution to the LBP is to compute the probability of transitions in both directions.,"{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"This way we can use two MEMM taggers, one of which scans the input from left to right and the other scans the input from right to left.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"This strategy has been successfully used in (Shen and Joshi, 2003).","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"In that paper, pairwise voting (van Halteren et al., 1998) has been used to combine the results of two supertaggers that scan the input in the opposite directions.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
The pairwise voting is not suitable in this application because we must make sure that the LMR tags assigned to consecutive words are compatible.,"{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, an LM tag cannot immediately follow an MM.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
"Pairwise voting does not use any contextual information, so it cannot prevent incompatible tags from occurring.","{'title': '2 Tagging Algorithms', 'number': '2'}"
