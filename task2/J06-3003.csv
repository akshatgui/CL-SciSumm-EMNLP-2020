One application for relational similarity is classifying semantic relations in nounmodifier pairs (Turney and Littman 2005).,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 7, we evaluate the performance of LRA with a set of 600 noun-modifier pairs from Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"

"In this section, we explore connections between attributional and relational similarity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner (1990) distinguish attributes and relations as follows: Attributes are predicates taking one argument (e.g., X is red, X is large), whereas relations are predicates taking two or more arguments (e.g., X collides with Y, X is larger than Y).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Attributes are used to state properties of objects; relations express relations between objects or propositions.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Gentner (1983) notes that what counts as an attribute or a relation can depend on the context.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, large can be viewed as an attribute of X, LARGE(X), or a relation between X and some standard Y, LARGER THAN(X, Y).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The amount of attributional similarity between two words, A and B, depends on the degree of correspondence between the properties of A and B.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"A measure of attributional similarity is a function that maps two words, A and B, to a real number, sima(A,B) E R. The more correspondence there is between the properties of A and B, the greater their attributional similarity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, dog and wolf have a relatively high degree of attributional similarity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The amount of relational similarity between two pairs of words, A:B and C:D, depends on the degree of correspondence between the relations between A and B and the relations between C and D. A measure of relational similarity is a function that maps two pairs, A:B and C:D, to a real number, simr(A:B,C:D) E R. The more correspondence there is between the relations of A:B and C:D, the greater their relational similarity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, dog:bark and cat:meow have a relatively high degree of relational similarity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Cognitive scientists distinguish words that are semantically associated (bee–honey) from words that are semantically similar (deer–pony), although they recognize that some words are both associated and similar (doctor–nurse) (Chiarello et al. 1990).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Both of these are types of attributional similarity, since they are based on correspondence between attributes (e.g., bees and honey are both found in hives; deer and ponies are both mammals).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Budanitsky and Hirst (2001) describe semantic relatedness as follows: Recent research on the topic in computational linguistics has emphasized the perspective of semantic relatedness of two lexemes in a lexical resource, or its inverse, semantic distance.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"It’s important to note that semantic relatedness is a more general concept than similarity; similar entities are usually assumed to be related by virtue of their likeness (bank–trust company), but dissimilar entities may also be semantically related by lexical relationships such as meronymy (car–wheel) and antonymy (hot–cold), or just by any kind of functional relationship or frequent association (pencil–paper, penguin–Antarctica).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"As these examples show, semantic relatedness is the same as attributional similarity (e.g., hot and cold are both kinds of temperature, pencil and paper are both used for writing).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Here we prefer to use the term attributional similarity because it emphasizes the contrast with relational similarity.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
The term semantic relatedness may lead to confusion when the term relational similarity is also under discussion.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Resnik (1995) describes semantic similarity as follows: Semantic similarity represents a special case of semantic relatedness: for example, cars and gasoline would seem to be more closely related than, say, cars and bicycles, but the latter pair are certainly more similar.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Rada et al. (1989) suggest that the assessment of similarity in semantic networks can in fact be thought of as involving just taxonomic (IS-A) links, to the exclusion of other link types; that view will also be taken here, although admittedly it excludes some potentially useful information.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Thus semantic similarity is a specific type of attributional similarity.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The term semantic similarity is misleading, because it refers to a type of attributional similarity, yet relational similarity is not any less semantic than attributional similarity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"

The results support the claim that lexicon-based algorithms have no advantage over corpus-based algorithms for recognizing synonymy.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We may distinguish near analogies (mason:stone::carpenter:wood) from far analogies (traffic:street::water:riverbed) (Gentner 1983; Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner 1990).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In an analogy A:B::C:D, where there is a high degree of relational similarity between A:B and C:D, if there is also a high degree of attributional similarity between A and C, and between B and D, then A:B::C:D is a near analogy; otherwise, it is a far analogy.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"It seems possible that SAT analogy questions might consist largely of near analogies, in which case they can be solved using attributional similarity measures.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We could score each candidate analogy by the average of the attributional similarity, sima, between A and C and between B and D: This kind of approach was used in two of the thirteen modules in Turney et al. (2003) (see Section 3.1).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"

"The performance of the algorithms was measured by precision, recall, and F, defined as follows: Note that recall is the same as percent correct (for multiple-choice questions, with only zero or one guesses allowed per question, but not in general).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Table 4 shows the experimental results for our set of 374 analogy questions.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, using the algorithm of Hirst and St-Onge (1998), 120 questions were answered correctly, 224 incorrectly, and 30 questions were skipped.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"

"The first five algorithms in Table 4 are implemented in Pedersen’s WordNetSimilarity package.2 The sixth algorithm (Turney 2001) used the Waterloo MultiText System (WMTS), as described in Terra and Clarke (2003).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The difference between the lowest performance (Jiang and Conrath 1997) and random guessing is statistically significant with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"

"Each individual connection (e.g., from revolve(planet, sun) to revolve(electron, nucleus)) in an analogical mapping implies that the connected relations are similar; thus, SMT requires a measure of relational similarity in order to form maps.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"Early versions of SME only mapped identical relations, but later versions of SME allowed similar, nonidentical relations to match (Falkenhainer 1990).","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"However, the focus of research in analogy making has been on the mapping process as a whole, rather than measuring the similarity between any two particular relations; hence, the similarity measures used in SME at the level of individual connections are somewhat rudimentary.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"
"We believe that a more sophisticated measure of relational similarity, such as LRA, may enhance the performance of SME.","{'title': '3.', 'number': '4'}"

The parameter values were determined by trying a small number of possible values on a small set of questions that were set aside.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Since LRA is intended to be an unsupervised learning algorithm, we did not attempt to tune the parameter values to maximize the precision and recall on the 374 SAT questions.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"

"As mentioned in the introduction, LRA extends the VSM approach of Turney and Littman (2005) by (1) exploring variations on the analogies by replacing words with synonyms (step 1), (2) automatically generating connecting patterns (step 4), and (3) smoothing the data with SVD (step 9).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In this subsection, we ablate each of these three components to assess their contribution to the performance of LRA.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
Table 17 shows the results.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Without SVD (compare column 1 to 2 in Table 17), performance drops, but the drop is not statistically significant with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"However, we hypothesize that the drop in performance would be significant with a larger set of word pairs.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"More word pairs would increase the sample size, which would decrease the 95% confidence interval, which would likely show that SVD is making a significant contribution.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Furthermore, more word pairs would increase the matrix size, which would give SVD more leverage.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"For example, Landauer and Dumais (1997) apply SVD to a matrix of 30,473 columns by 60,768 rows, but our matrix here is 8,000 columns by 17,232 rows.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
We are currently gathering more SAT questions to test this hypothesis.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Without synonyms (compare column 1 to 3 in Table 17), recall drops significantly (from 56.1% to 49.5%), but the drop in precision is not significant.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"When the synonym component is dropped, the number of skipped questions rises from 4 to 22, which demonstrates the value of the synonym component of LRA for compensating for sparse data.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"When both SVD and synonyms are dropped (compare column 1 to 4 in Table 17), the decrease in recall is significant, but the decrease in precision is not significant.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Again, we believe that a larger sample size would show that the drop in precision is significant.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"If we eliminate both synonyms and SVD from LRA, all that distinguishes LRA from VSM-WMTS is the patterns (step 4).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"The VSM approach uses a fixed list of 64 patterns to generate 128 dimensional vectors (Turney and Littman 2005), whereas LRA uses a dynamically generated set of 4,000 patterns, resulting in 8,000 dimensional vectors.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
We can see the value of the automatically generated patterns by comparing LRA without synonyms and SVD (column 4) to VSM-WMTS (column 5).,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"The difference in both precision and recall is statistically significant with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"The ablation experiments support the value of the patterns (step 4) and synonyms (step 1) in LRA, but the contribution of SVD (step 9) has not been proven, although we believe more data will support its effectiveness.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Nonetheless, the three components together result in a 16% increase in F (compare column 1 to 5).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"We know a priori that, if A:B::C:D, then B:A::D:C. For example, mason is to stone as carpenter is to wood implies stone is to mason as wood is to carpenter.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Therefore, a good measure of relational similarity, simr, should obey the following equation: In steps 5 and 6 of the LRA algorithm (Section 5.5), we ensure that the matrix X is symmetrical, so that equation (8) is necessarily true for LRA.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
The matrix is designed so that the row vector for A:B is different from the row vector for B:A only by a permutation of the elements.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
The same permutation distinguishes the row vectors for C:D and D:C. Therefore the cosine of the angle between A:B and C:D must be identical to the cosine of the angle between B:A and D:C (see equation (7)).,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"To discover the consequences of this design decision, we altered steps 5 and 6 so that symmetry is no longer preserved.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In step 5, for each word pair A:B that appears in the input set, we only have one row.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
There is no row for B:A unless B:A also appears in the input set.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Thus the number of rows in the matrix dropped from 17,232 to 8,616.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In step 6, we no longer have two columns for each pattern P, one for “word1 P word2” and another for “word2 P word1.” However, to be fair, we kept the total number of columns at 8,000.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In step 4, we selected the top 8,000 patterns (instead of the top 4,000), distinguishing the pattern “word1 P word2” from the pattern “word2 P word1” (instead of considering them equivalent).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Thus a pattern P with a high frequency is likely to appear in two columns, in both possible orders, but a lower frequency pattern might appear in only one column, in only one possible order.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
These changes resulted in a slight decrease in performance.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
Recall dropped from 56.1% to 55.3% and precision dropped from 56.8% to 55.9%.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
The decrease is not statistically significant.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"However, the modified algorithm no longer obeys equation (8).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Although dropping symmetry appears to cause no significant harm to the performance of the algorithm on the SAT questions, we prefer to retain symmetry, to ensure that equation (8) is satisfied.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Note that, if A:B::C:D, it does not follow that B:A::C:D. For example, it is false that “stone is to mason as carpenter is to wood.” In general (except when the semantic relations between A and B are symmetrical), we have the following inequality: Therefore we do not want A:B and B:A to be represented by identical row vectors, although it would ensure that equation (8) is satisfied.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In step 12 of LRA, the relational similarity between A:B and C:D is the average of the cosines, among the (num filter + 1)2 cosines from step 11, that are greater than or equal to the cosine of the original pairs, A:B and C:D. That is, the average includes only those alternates that are “better” than the originals.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Taking all alternates instead of the better alternates, recall drops from 56.1% to 40.4% and precision drops from 56.8% to 40.8%.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Both decreases are statistically significant with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
Suppose a word pair A:B corresponds to a vector r in the matrix X.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
It would be convenient if inspection of r gave us a simple explanation or description of the relation between A and B.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"For example, suppose the word pair ostrich:bird maps to the row vector r. It would be pleasing to look in r and find that the largest element corresponds to the pattern “is the largest” (i.e., “ostrich is the largest bird”).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Unfortunately, inspection of r reveals no such convenient patterns.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
We hypothesize that the semantic content of a vector is distributed over the whole vector; it is not concentrated in a few elements.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"To test this hypothesis, we modified step 10 of LRA.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Instead of projecting the 8,000 dimensional vectors into the 300 dimensional space UkEk, we use the matrix UkEkVTk .","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"This matrix yields the same cosines as UkEk, but preserves the original 8,000 dimensions, making it easier to interpret the row vectors.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"For each row vector in UkEkVTk , we select the N largest values and set all other values to zero.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
The idea here is that we will only pay attention to the N most important patterns in r; the remaining patterns will be ignored.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"This reduces the length of the row vectors, but the cosine is the dot product of normalized vectors (all vectors are normalized to unit length; see equation (7)), so the change to the vector lengths has no impact; only the angle of the vectors is important.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"If most of the semantic content is in the N largest elements of r, then setting the remaining elements to zero should have relatively little impact.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Table 18 shows the performance as N varies from 1 to 3,000.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"The precision and recall are significantly below the baseline LRA until N ≥ 300 (95% confidence, Fisher Exact Test).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"In other words, for a typical SAT analogy question, we need to examine the top 300 patterns to explain why LRA selected one choice instead of another.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
We are currently working on an extension of LRA that will explain with a single pattern why one choice is better than another.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"We have had some promising results, but this work is not yet mature.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"However, we can confidently claim that interpreting the vectors is not trivial.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Turney and Littman (2005) used 64 manually generated patterns, whereas LRA uses 4,000 automatically generated patterns.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
We know from Section 6.5 that the automatically generated patterns are significantly better than the manually generated patterns.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
It may be interesting to see how many of the manually generated patterns appear within the automatically generated patterns.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"If we require an exact match, 50 of the 64 manual patterns can be found in the automatic patterns.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"If we are lenient about wildcards, and count the pattern not the as matching * not the (for example), then 60 of the 64 manual patterns appear within the automatic patterns.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"This suggests that the improvement in performance with the automatic patterns is due to the increased quantity of patterns, rather than a qualitative difference in the patterns.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
Turney and Littman (2005) point out that some of their 64 patterns have been used by other researchers.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"For example, Hearst (1992) used the pattern such as to discover hyponyms and Berland and Charniak (1999) used the pattern of the to discover meronyms.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Both of these patterns are included in the 4,000 patterns automatically generated by LRA.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"The novelty in Turney and Littman (2005) is that their patterns are not used to mine text for instances of word pairs that fit the patterns (Hearst 1992; Berland and Charniak 1999); instead, they are used to gather frequency data for building vectors that represent the relation between a given pair of words.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
The results in Section 6.8 show that a vector contains more information than any single pattern or small set of patterns; a vector is a distributed representation.,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"LRA is distinct from Hearst (1992) and Berland and Charniak (1999) in its focus on distributed representations, which it shares with Turney and Littman (2005), but LRA goes beyond Turney and Littman (2005) by finding patterns automatically.","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Riloff and Jones (1999) and Yangarber (2003) also find patterns automatically, but their goal is to mine text for instances of word pairs; the same goal as Hearst (1992) and Berland and Charniak (1999).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
"Because LRA uses patterns to build distributed vector representations, it can exploit patterns that would be much too noisy and unreliable for the kind of text mining instance extraction that is the objective of Hearst (1992), Berland and Charniak (1999), Riloff and Jones (1999), and Yangarber (2003).","{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"
Therefore LRA can simply select the highest frequency patterns (step 4 in Section 5.5); it does not need the more sophisticated selection algorithms of Riloff and Jones (1999) and Yangarber (2003).,"{'title': '6.', 'number': '7'}"

"For clarity, we decided not to include these relations in Table 19.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"In this table, H represents the head noun and M represents the modifier.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"For example, in flu virus, the head noun (H) is virus and the modifier (M) is flu (*).","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"In English, the modifier (typically a noun or adjective) usually precedes the head noun.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"In the description of purpose, V represents an arbitrary verb.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"In concert hall, the hall is for presenting concerts (V is present) or holding concerts (V is hold) (†).","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) organized the relations into groups.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
The five capitalized terms in the Relation column of Table 19 are the names of five groups of semantic relations.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"(The original table had a sixth group, but there are no examples of this group in the data set.)","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
We make use of this grouping in the following experiments.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
The following experiments use single nearest neighbor classification with leave-one-out cross-validation.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"For leave-one-out cross-validation, the testing set consists of a single noun-modifier pair and the training set consists of the 599 remaining noun-modifiers.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"The data set is split 600 times, so that each noun-modifier gets a turn as the testing word pair.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
The predicted class of the testing pair is the class of the single nearest neighbor in the training set.,"{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"As the measure of nearness, we use LRA to calculate the relational similarity between the testing pair and the training pairs.","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"
"The single nearest neighbor algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm (i.e., it requires a training set of labeled object property obj prop sunken ship H underwent M part part printer tray H is part of M possessor posr national debt M has H property prop blue book His M product prod plum tree H produces M source src olive oil M is the source of H stative st sleeping dog H is in a state of M whole whl daisy chain M is part of H","{'title': '7.', 'number': '8'}"

"Each SAT question has five choices, so answering 374 SAT questions required calculating 374 x 5 x 16 = 29,920 cosines.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"The factor of 16 comes from the alternate pairs, step 11 in LRA.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"With the noun-modifier pairs, using leave-one-out cross-validation, each test pair has 599 choices, so an exhaustive application of LRA would require calculating 600 x 599 x 16 = 5,750,400 cosines.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"To reduce the amount of computation required, we first find the 30 nearest neighbors for each pair, ignoring the alternate pairs (600 x 599 = 359,400 cosines), and then apply the full LRA, including the alternates, to just those 30 neighbors (600 x 30 x 16 = 288, 000 cosines), which requires calculating only 359,400 + 288, 000 = 647,400 cosines.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
There are 600 word pairs in the input set for LRA.,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"In step 2, introducing alternate pairs multiplies the number of pairs by four, resulting in 2,400 pairs.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"In step 5, for each pair A:B, we add B:A, yielding 4,800 pairs.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"However, some pairs are dropped because they correspond to zero vectors and a few words do not appear in Lin’s thesaurus.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"The sparse matrix (step 7) has 4,748 rows and 8,000 columns, with a density of 8.4%.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"Following Turney and Littman (2005), we evaluate the performance by accuracy and also by the macroaveraged F measure (Lewis 1991).","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"Macroaveraging calculates the precision, recall, and F for each class separately, and then calculates the average across all classes.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"Microaveraging combines the true positive, false positive, and false negative counts for all of the classes, and then calculates precision, recall, and F from the combined counts.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"Macroaveraging gives equal weight to all classes, but microaveraging gives more weight to larger classes.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"We use macroaveraging (giving equal weight to all classes), because we have no reason to believe that the class sizes in the data set reflect the actual distribution of the classes in a real corpus.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
Classification with 30 distinct classes is a hard problem.,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"To make the task easier, we can collapse the 30 classes to 5 classes, using the grouping that is given in Table 19.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"For example, agent and beneficiary both collapse to participant.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"On the 30 class problem, LRA with the single nearest neighbor algorithm achieves an accuracy of 39.8% (239/600) and a macroaveraged F of 36.6%.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
Always guessing the majority class would result in an accuracy of 8.2% (49/600).,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"On the 5 class problem, the accuracy is 58.0% (348/600) and the macroaveraged F is 54.6%.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
Always guessing the majority class would give an accuracy of 43.3% (260/600).,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"For both the 30 class and 5 class problems, LRA’s accuracy is significantly higher than guessing the majority class, with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
Table 20 shows the performance of LRA and VSM on the 30 class problem.,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
VSM-AV is VSM with the AltaVista corpus and VSM-WMTS is VSM with the WMTS corpus.,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
The results for VSM-AV are taken from Turney and Littman (2005).,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"All three pairwise differences in the three F measures are statistically significant at the 95% level, according to the Paired t-Test (Feelders and Verkooijen 1995).","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"The accuracy of LRA is significantly higher than the accuracies of VSM-AV and VSM-WMTS, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990), but the difference between the two VSM accuracies is not significant.","{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
Table 21 compares the performance of LRA and VSM on the 5 class problem.,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
The accuracy and F measure of LRA are significantly higher than the accuracies and,"{'title': 'QUALITY', 'number': '9'}"
"The experimental results in Sections 6 and 7 demonstrate that LRA performs significantly better than the VSM, but it is also clear that there is room for improvement.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"The accuracy might not yet be adequate for practical applications, although past work has shown that it is possible to adjust the trade-off of precision versus recall (Turney and Littman 2005).","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"For some of the applications, such as information extraction, LRA might be suitable if it is adjusted for high precision, at the expense of low recall.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
Another limitation is speed; it took almost 9 days for LRA to answer 374 analogy questions.,"{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"However, with progress in computer hardware, speed will gradually become less of a concern.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"Also, the software has not been optimized for speed; there are several places where the efficiency could be increased and many operations are parallelizable.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"It may also be possible to precompute much of the information for LRA, although this would require substantial changes to the algorithm.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
The difference in performance between VSM-AV and VSM-WMTS shows that VSM is sensitive to the size of the corpus.,"{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"Although LRA is able to surpass VSM-AV when the WMTS corpus is only about one tenth the size of the AV corpus, it seems likely that LRA would perform better with a larger corpus.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"The WMTS corpus requires one terabyte of hard disk space, but progress in hardware will likely make 10 or even 100 terabytes affordable in the relatively near future.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"For noun-modifier classification, more labeled data should yield performance improvements.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"With 600 noun-modifier pairs and 30 classes, the average class has only 20 examples.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
We expect that the accuracy would improve substantially with 5 or 10 times more examples.,"{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"Unfortunately, it is time consuming and expensive to acquire hand-labeled data.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
Another issue with noun-modifier classification is the choice of classification scheme for the semantic relations.,"{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
The 30 classes of Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) might not be the best scheme.,"{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"Other researchers have proposed different schemes (Vanderwende 1994; Barker and Szpakowicz 1998; Rosario and Hearst 2001; Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002).","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
It seems likely that some schemes are easier for machine learning than others.,"{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"For some applications, 30 classes may not be necessary; the 5 class scheme may be sufficient.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"LRA, like VSM, is a corpus-based approach to measuring relational similarity.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"Past work suggests that a hybrid approach, combining multiple modules, some corpusbased, some lexicon-based, will surpass any purebred approach (Turney et al. 2003).","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"In future work, it would be natural to combine the corpus-based approach of LRA with the lexicon-based approach of Veale (2004), perhaps using the combination method of Turney et al. (2003).","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"SVD is only one of many methods for handling sparse, noisy data.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"We have also experimented with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung 1999), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann 1999), Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) (Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller 1997), and Iterative Scaling (IS) (Ando 2000).","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"We had some interesting results with small matrices (around 2,000 rows by 1,000 columns), but none of these methods seemed substantially better than SVD and none of them scaled up to the matrix sizes we are using here (e.g., 17,232 rows and 8,000 columns; see Section 6.1).","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"In step 4 of LRA, we simply select the top num patterns most frequent patterns and discard the remaining patterns.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
Perhaps a more sophisticated selection algorithm would improve the performance of LRA.,"{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"We have tried a variety of ways of selecting patterns, but it seems that the method of selection has little impact on performance.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"We hypothesize that the distributed vector representation is not sensitive to the selection method, but it is possible that future work will find a method that yields significant improvement in performance.","{'title': '8.', 'number': '10'}"
"This article has introduced a new method for calculating relational similarity, Latent Relational Analysis.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
"The experiments demonstrate that LRA performs better than the VSM approach, when evaluated with SAT word analogy questions and with the task of classifying noun-modifier expressions.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
"The VSM approach represents the relation between a pair of words with a vector, in which the elements are based on the frequencies of 64 hand-built patterns in a large corpus.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
"LRA extends this approach in three ways: (1) The patterns are generated dynamically from the corpus, (2) SVD is used to smooth the data, and (3) a thesaurus is used to explore variations of the word pairs.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
"With the WMTS corpus (about 5 × 1010 English words), LRA achieves an F of 56.5%, whereas the F of VSM is 40.3%.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
We have presented several examples of the many potential applications for measures of relational similarity.,"{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
"Just as attributional similarity measures have proven to have many practical uses, we expect that relational similarity measures will soon become widely used.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
Gentner et al. (2001) argue that relational similarity is essential to understanding novel metaphors (as opposed to conventional metaphors).,"{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
Many researchers have argued that metaphor is the heart of human thinking (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Hofstadter and the Fluid Analogies Research Group 1995; Gentner et al. 2001; French 2002).,"{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
We believe that relational similarity plays a fundamental role in the mind and therefore relational similarity measures could be crucial for artificial intelligence.,"{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
"In future work, we plan to investigate some potential applications for LRA.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
"It is possible that the error rate of LRA is still too high for practical applications, but the fact that LRA matches average human performance on SAT analogy questions is encouraging.","{'title': '9.', 'number': '11'}"
