"Our sys tem uses the Viterbi search (Allen, 1995) instead of sequential determination.For training, we use ?CRL data?, which was prepared for IREX (Information Retrieval and Extrac tion Exercise1, Sekine and Eriguchi (2000)).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It has about 19,000 NEs in 1,174 articles.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Now, Japanese NE recognition is solved by theclassification of words (Sekine et al, 1998; Borth wick, 1999; Uchimoto et al, 2000).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For instance, the words in ?President George Herbert Bush saidClinton is . . .","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"If a word does not belong to any namedentities, it is labeled as OTHER.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Since IREX de fines eight NE classes, words are classified into 33 ( *UTWVEX!K# ) categories.Each sample is represented by 15 features be cause each word has three features (part-of-speech tag, character type, and the word itself), and two preceding words and two succeeding words are also used for context dependence.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
