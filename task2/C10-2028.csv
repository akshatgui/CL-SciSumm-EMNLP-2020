Automated identification of diverse sen timent types can be beneficial for manyNLP systems such as review summariza tion and public media analysis.,Introduction
In some ofthese systems there is an option of assign ing a sentiment value to a single sentence or a very short text.,Introduction
"In this paper we propose a supervised sentiment classification framework whichis based on data from Twitter, a popu lar microblogging service.",Introduction
"By utilizing50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys as sen timent labels, this framework avoids theneed for labor intensive manual annotation, allowing identification and classifi cation of diverse sentiment types of shorttexts.",Introduction
We evaluate the contribution of different feature types for sentiment classification and show that our framework successfully identifies sentiment types of untagged sentences.,Introduction
The quality of the senti ment identification was also confirmed byhuman judges.,Introduction
We also explore dependencies and overlap between different sen timent types represented by smileys and Twitter hashtags.,Introduction
"A huge amount of social media including news,forums, product reviews and blogs contain nu merous sentiment-based sentences.",Experiment/Discussion
Sentiment is defined as ?a personal belief or judgment that ?* Both authors equally contributed to this paper.is not founded on proof or certainty?1.,Experiment/Discussion
Senti ment expressions may describe the mood of thewriter (happy/sad/bored/grateful/...),Experiment/Discussion
"or the opin ion of the writer towards some specific entity (X is great/I hate X, etc.).",Experiment/Discussion
"Automated identification of diverse sentimenttypes can be beneficial for many NLP systems such as review summarization systems, dia logue systems and public media analysis systems.",Experiment/Discussion
Sometimes it is directly requested by the user toobtain articles or sentences with a certain senti ment value (e.g Give me all positive reviews of product X/ Show me articles which explain why movie X is boring).,Experiment/Discussion
In some other cases obtaining sentiment value can greatly enhance information extraction tasks like review summarization.,Experiment/Discussion
"Whilethe majority of existing sentiment extraction sys tems focus on polarity identification (e.g., positive vs. negative reviews) or extraction of a handful of pre-specified mood labels, there are many useful and relatively unexplored sentiment types.",Experiment/Discussion
Sentiment extraction systems usually require an extensive set of manually supplied sentiment words or a handcrafted sentiment-specific dataset.,Experiment/Discussion
"With the recent popularity of article tagging, some social media types like blogs allow users to add sentiment tags to articles.",Experiment/Discussion
This allows to use blogsas a large user-labeled dataset for sentiment learning and identification.,Experiment/Discussion
"However, the set of sentiment tags in most blog platforms is somewhat re stricted.",Experiment/Discussion
"Moreover, the assigned tag applies to the whole blog post while a finer grained sentiment extraction is needed (McDonald et al, 2007).With the recent popularity of the Twitter micro blogging service, a huge amount of frequently 1WordNet 2.1 definitions.",Experiment/Discussion
241self-standing short textual sentences (tweets) became openly available for the research community.,Experiment/Discussion
Many of these tweets contain a wide vari ety of user-defined hashtags.,Experiment/Discussion
Some of these tagsare sentiment tags which assign one or more senti ment values to a tweet.,Experiment/Discussion
In this paper we propose away to utilize such tagged Twitter data for classi fication of a wide variety of sentiment types from text.,Experiment/Discussion
We utilize 50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys assentiment labels which allow us to build a classifier for dozens of sentiment types for short tex tual sentences.,Experiment/Discussion
"In our study we use four different feature types (punctuation, words, n-grams and patterns) for sentiment classification and evaluate the contribution of each feature type for this task.We show that our framework successfully identi fies sentiment types of the untagged tweets.",Experiment/Discussion
We confirm the quality of our algorithm using human judges.,Experiment/Discussion
We also explore the dependencies and overlap between different sentiment types represented by smileys and Twitter tags.,Experiment/Discussion
Section 2 describes related work.,Experiment/Discussion
"Section 3 details classification features and the algorithm, while Section 4 describes the dataset and labels.",Experiment/Discussion
"Automated and manual evaluation protocols and results are presented in Section 5, followed by a short discussion.",Experiment/Discussion
"Sentiment analysis tasks typically combine twodifferent tasks: (1) Identifying sentiment expres sions, and (2) determining the polarity (sometimes called valence) of the expressed sentiment.",Experiment/Discussion
These tasks are closely related as the purpose of most works is to determine whether a sentence bears a positive or a negative (implicit or explicit) opinion about the target of the sentiment.,Experiment/Discussion
"Several works (Wiebe, 2000; Turney, 2002;Riloff, 2003; Whitelaw et al, 2005) use lexical re sources and decide whether a sentence expressesa sentiment by the presence of lexical items (sen timent words).",Experiment/Discussion
"Others combine additional feature types for this decision (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al, 2005; Bloom et al, 2007; McDonald et al, 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008a; Melville et al, 2009).",Experiment/Discussion
"It was suggested that sentiment words may havedifferent senses (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Wiebe and Mihal cea, 2006), thus word sense disambiguation can improve sentiment analysis systems (Akkaya et al., 2009).",Experiment/Discussion
All works mentioned above identifyevaluative sentiment expressions and their polar ity.,Experiment/Discussion
"Another line of works aims at identifying abroader range of sentiment classes expressing various emotions such as happiness, sadness, boredom, fear, and gratitude, regardless (or in addi tion to) positive or negative evaluations.",Experiment/Discussion
"Mihalcea and Liu (2006) derive lists of words and phrases with happiness factor from a corpus of blog posts, where each post is annotated by the blogger with a mood label.",Experiment/Discussion
Balog et al (2006) use the mood annotation of blog posts coupled with news datain order to discover the events that drive the dom inant moods expressed in blogs.,Experiment/Discussion
Mishne (2005) used an ontology of over 100 moods assigned to blog posts to classify blog texts according tomoods.,Experiment/Discussion
"While (Mishne, 2005) classifies a blog entry (post), (Mihalcea and Liu, 2006) assign a hap piness factor to specific words and expressions.",Experiment/Discussion
Mishne used a much broader range of moods.,Experiment/Discussion
"Strapparava and Mihalcea (2008) classify blogposts and news headlines to six sentiment cate gories.While most of the works on sentiment analysis focus on full text, some works address senti ment analysis in the phrasal and sentence level, see (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Wilson et al,2005; McDonald et al, 2007; Titov and McDon ald, 2008a; Titov and McDonald, 2008b; Wilson et al, 2009; Tsur et al, 2010) among others.",Experiment/Discussion
Only a few studies analyze the sentiment and polarity of tweets targeted at major brands.,Experiment/Discussion
Jansenet al (2009) used a commercial sentiment analyzer as well as a manually labeled corpus.,Experiment/Discussion
Davi dov et al (2010) analyze the use of the #sarcasmhashtag and its contribution to automatic recognition of sarcastic tweets.,Experiment/Discussion
"To the best of our knowledge, there are no works employing Twitter hashtags to learn a wide range of emotions and the re lations between the different emotions.",Experiment/Discussion
242,Experiment/Discussion
Below we propose a set of classification featuresand present the algorithm for sentiment classifica tion.,Experiment/Discussion
3.1 Classification features.,Experiment/Discussion
"We utilize four basic feature types for sentimentclassification: single word features, n-gram fea tures, pattern features and punctuation features.For the classification, all feature types are com bined into a single feature vector.",Experiment/Discussion
3.1.1 Word-based and n-gram-based features Each word appearing in a sentence serves as a binary feature with weight equal to the inverted count of this word in the Twitter corpus.,Experiment/Discussion
We also took each consecutive word sequence containing2?5 words as a binary n-gram feature using a similar weighting strategy.,Experiment/Discussion
"Thus n-gram features al ways have a higher weight than features of their component words, and rare words have a higher weight than common words.",Experiment/Discussion
Words or n-gramsappearing in less than 0.5% of the training set sen tences do not constitute a feature.,Experiment/Discussion
ASCII smileys and other punctuation sequences containing two or more consecutive punctuation symbols were used as single-word features.,Experiment/Discussion
"Word features alsoinclude the substituted meta-words for URLs, ref erences and hashtags (see Subsection 4.1).",Experiment/Discussion
3.1.2 Pattern-based featuresOur main feature type is based on surface pat terns.,Experiment/Discussion
"For automated extraction of patterns, we followed the pattern definitions given in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).",Experiment/Discussion
We classified words into high-frequency words (HFWs) and content words (CWs).,Experiment/Discussion
A word whose corpus frequency is more (less) than FH (FC) is considered to be a HFW(CW).We estimate word frequency from the train ing set rather than from an external corpus.,Experiment/Discussion
"Unlike (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), we consider allsingle punctuation characters or consecutive se quences of punctuation characters as HFWs.",Experiment/Discussion
"We also consider URL, REF, and HASHTAG tags as HFWs for pattern extraction.",Experiment/Discussion
We define a pattern as an ordered sequence of high frequency words and slots for content words.,Experiment/Discussion
"Following (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008), the FH and FC thresholds were set to 1000 words per million (upper bound for FC) and 100 words per million (lower bound for FH )2.",Experiment/Discussion
The patterns allow 2?6 HFWs and 1?5 slots forCWs.,Experiment/Discussion
"To avoid collection of patterns which capture only a part of a meaningful multiword ex pression, we require patterns to start and to end with a HFW.",Experiment/Discussion
Thus a minimal pattern is of the form [HFW] [CW slot] [HFW].,Experiment/Discussion
For each sentenceit is possible to generate dozens of different pat terns that may overlap.,Experiment/Discussion
"As with words and n-gram features, we do not treat as features any patterns which appear in less than 0.5% of the training set sentences.",Experiment/Discussion
"Since each feature vector is based on a singlesentence (tweet), we would like to allow approximate pattern matching for enhancement of learn ing flexibility.",Experiment/Discussion
The value of a pattern feature is estimated according the one of the following four scenarios3: ? ????????????????????????,Experiment/Discussion
1 count(p) : Exact match ? all the pattern components appear in the sentence in correct order without any additional words.,Experiment/Discussion
count(p) : Sparse match ? same as exact match but additional non-matching words can be inserted between pattern components.,Experiment/Discussion
"??n N?count(p) : Incomplete match ? only n > 1 of N pattern components appear in the sentence, while some non-matching words can be inserted in-between.",Experiment/Discussion
At least one of the appearing components should be a HFW.,Experiment/Discussion
0 : No match ? nothing or only a single pattern component appears in the sentence.,Experiment/Discussion
0 ? ?,Experiment/Discussion
1 and 0 ? ?,Experiment/Discussion
"1 are parameters we use to assign reduced scores for imperfect matches.Since the patterns we use are relatively long, ex act matches are uncommon, and taking advantageof partial matches allows us to significantly re duce the sparsity of the feature vectors.",Experiment/Discussion
"We used ? = ? = 0.1 in all experiments.This pattern based framework was proven effi cient for sarcasm detection in (Tsur et al, 2010; 2Note that the FH and FC bounds allow overlap between some HFWs and CWs.",Experiment/Discussion
"See (Davidov and Rappoport, 2008) for a short discussion.",Experiment/Discussion
"3As with word and n-gram features, the maximal featureweight of a pattern p is defined as the inverse count of a pat tern in the complete Twitter corpus.",Experiment/Discussion
"243 Davidov et al, 2010).",Experiment/Discussion
"3.1.3 Efficiency of feature selection Since we avoid selection of textual features which have a training set frequency below 0.5%, we perform feature selection incrementally, on each stage using the frequencies of the features obtained during the previous stages.",Experiment/Discussion
"Thus first we estimate the frequencies of single words in the training set, then we only consider creationof n-grams from single words with sufficient frequency, finally we only consider patterns composed from sufficiently frequent words and n grams.",Experiment/Discussion
"3.1.4 Punctuation-based features In addition to pattern-based features we used the following generic features: (1) Sentence length in words, (2) Number of ?!?",Experiment/Discussion
"characters in the sentence, (3) Number of ???",Experiment/Discussion
"characters in the sentence, (4) Number of quotes in the sentence, and (5) Number of capitalized/all capitals wordsin the sentence.",Experiment/Discussion
"All these features were normal ized by dividing them by the (maximal observed value times averaged maximal value of the other feature groups), thus the maximal weight of each of these features is equal to the averaged weight of a single pattern/word/n-gram feature.",Experiment/Discussion
3.2 Classification algorithm.,Experiment/Discussion
In order to assign a sentiment label to new exam ples in the test set we use a k-nearest neighbors(kNN)-like strategy.,Experiment/Discussion
We construct a feature vec tor for each example in the training and the test set.,Experiment/Discussion
We would like to assign a sentiment class toeach example in the test set.,Experiment/Discussion
"For each feature vec tor V in the test set, we compute the Euclidean distance to each of the matching vectors in the training set, where matching vectors are defined as ones which share at least one pattern/n-gram/word feature with v.Let ti, i = 1 . . .",Experiment/Discussion
"k be the k vectors with low est Euclidean distance to v4 with assigned labels Li, i = 1 . . .",Experiment/Discussion
"k. We calculate the mean distance d(ti, v) for this set of vectors and drop from the set up to five outliers for which the distance was more then twice the mean distance.",Experiment/Discussion
The label assigned 4We used k = 10 for all experiments.,Experiment/Discussion
to v is the label of the majority of the remaining vectors.,Experiment/Discussion
"If a similar number of remaining vectors have different labels, we assigned to the test vector the most frequent of these labels according to their frequency in the dataset.",Experiment/Discussion
"If there are no matching vectors found for v, we assigned the default ?no sentiment?",Experiment/Discussion
label since there is significantly more non-sentiment sentences than sentiment sentences in Twitter.,Experiment/Discussion
In our experiments we used an extensive Twit ter data collection as training and testing sets.,Experiment/Discussion
In our training sets we utilize sentiment hashtags andsmileys as classification labels.,Experiment/Discussion
Below we de scribe this dataset in detail.,Experiment/Discussion
4.1 Twitter dataset.,Experiment/Discussion
We have used a Twitter dataset generously pro vided to us by Brendan O?Connor.,Experiment/Discussion
"This dataset includes over 475 million tweets comprising roughly 15% of all public, non-?low quality?",Experiment/Discussion
tweets created from May 2009 to Jan 2010.Tweets are short sentences limited to 140 UTF 8 characters.,Experiment/Discussion
All non-English tweets and tweets which contain less than 5 proper English words5 were removed from the dataset.,Experiment/Discussion
"Apart of simple text, tweets may contain URLaddresses, references to other Twitter users (ap pear as @<user>) or a content tags (also called hashtags) assigned by the tweeter (#<tag>)which we use as labels for our supervised clas sification framework.",Experiment/Discussion
"Two examples of typical tweets are: ?#ipad #sucks and 6,510 people agree.",Experiment/Discussion
"See more on Ipad sucks page: http://j.mp/4OiYyg??, and ?Pay nomind to those who talk behind ur back, it sim ply means that u?re 2 steps ahead.",Experiment/Discussion
#ihatequotes?.,Experiment/Discussion
Note that in the first example the hashtagged words are a grammatical part of the sentence (itbecomes meaningless without them) while #ihate qoutes of the second example is a mere sentiment label and not part of the sentence.,Experiment/Discussion
Also note that hashtags can be composed of multiple words (with no spaces).,Experiment/Discussion
5Identification of proper English words was based on an available WN-based English dictionary 244 Category # of tags % agreement Strong sentiment 52 87 Likely sentiment 70 66 Context-dependent 110 61 Focused 45 75 No sentiment 3564 99 Table 1: Annotation results (2 judges) for the 3852 mostfrequent tweeter tags.,Experiment/Discussion
"The second column displays the av erage number of tags, and the last column shows % of tags annotated similarly by two judges.",Experiment/Discussion
"During preprocessing, we have replaced URL links, hashtags and references by URL/REF/TAG meta-words.",Experiment/Discussion
"This substitution obviously had some effect on the pattern recognition phase (see Section 3.1.2), however, our algorithm is robust enough to overcome this distortion.",Experiment/Discussion
4.2 Hashtag-based sentiment labels.,Experiment/Discussion
The Twitter dataset contains above 2.5 million dif ferent user-defined hashtags.,Experiment/Discussion
Many tweets include more than a single tag and 3852 ?frequent?,Experiment/Discussion
tags appear in more than 1000 different tweets.,Experiment/Discussion
"Two human judges manually annotated these frequenttags into five different categories: 1 ? strong sen timent (e.g #sucks in the example above), 2 ?most likely sentiment (e.g., #notcute), 3 ? contextdependent sentiment (e.g., #shoutsout), 4 ? fo cused sentiment (e.g., #tmobilesucks where the target of the sentiment is part of the hashtag), and 5 ? no sentiment (e.g. #obama).",Experiment/Discussion
Table 1 shows annotation results and the percentage of similarly assigned values for each category.,Experiment/Discussion
We selected 50 hashtags annotated ?1?,Experiment/Discussion
or ?2?by both judges.,Experiment/Discussion
For each of these tags we automatically sampled 1000 tweets resulting in 50000 la beled tweets.,Experiment/Discussion
We avoided sampling tweets which include more than one of the sampled hashtags.,Experiment/Discussion
As a no-sentiment dataset we randomly sampled 10000 tweets with no hashtags/smileys from thewhole dataset assuming that such a random sam ple is unlikely to contain a significant amount of sentiment sentences.,Experiment/Discussion
4.3 Smiley-based sentiment labels.,Experiment/Discussion
While there exist many ?official?,Experiment/Discussion
"lists of possibleASCII smileys, most of these smileys are infrequent or not commonly accepted and used as sen timent indicators by online communities.",Experiment/Discussion
We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) service in order to obtain a list of the most commonly used and unambiguous ASCII smileys.,Experiment/Discussion
We asked each of ten AMT human subjects to provide at least 6 commonly used ASCII mood-indicating smileystogether with one or more single-word descrip tions of the smiley-related mood state.,Experiment/Discussion
"From the obtained list of smileys we selected a subset of 15 smileys which were (1) provided by at least threehuman subjects, (2) described by at least two human subject using the same single-word descrip tion, and (3) appear at least 1000 times in our Twitter dataset.",Experiment/Discussion
"We then sampled 1000 tweets foreach of these smileys, using these smileys as sentiment tags in the sentiment classification frame work described in the previous section.",Experiment/Discussion
The purpose of our evaluation was to learn how well our framework can identify and distinguishbetween sentiment types defined by tags or smileys and to test if our framework can be successfully used to identify sentiment types in new un tagged sentences.,Results/Conclusion
5.1 Evaluation using cross-validation.,Results/Conclusion
In the first experiment we evaluated the consistency and quality of sentiment classification us ing cross-validation over the training set.,Results/Conclusion
"Fullyautomated evaluation allowed us to test the performance of our algorithm under several dif ferent feature settings: Pn+W-M-Pt-, Pn+W+M-Pt-, Pn+W+M+Pt-, Pn-W-M-Pt+ and FULL, where +/?",Results/Conclusion
"stands for utilization/omission of the followingfeature types: Pn:punctuation, W:Word, M:n grams (M stands for ?multi?), Pt:patterns.",Results/Conclusion
FULL stands for utilization of all feature types.,Results/Conclusion
"In this experimental setting, the training set was divided to 10 parts and a 10-fold cross validation test is executed.",Results/Conclusion
"Each time, we use 9 parts as thelabeled training data for feature selection and con struction of labeled vectors and the remaining part is used as a test set.",Results/Conclusion
The process was repeated tentimes.,Results/Conclusion
"To avoid utilization of labels as strong fea tures in the test set, we removed all instances of involved label hashtags/smileys from the tweets used as the test set.",Results/Conclusion
245 Setup Smileys Hashtags random 0.06 0.02 Pn+W-M-Pt- 0.16 0.06 Pn+W+M-Pt- 0.25 0.15 Pn+W+M+Pt- 0.29 0.18 Pn-W-M-Pt+ 0.5 0.26 FULL 0.64 0.31 Table 2: Multi-class classification results for smileys andhashtags.,Results/Conclusion
The table shows averaged harmonic f-score for 10 fold cross validation.,Results/Conclusion
51 (16) sentiment classes were used for hashtags (smileys).,Results/Conclusion
Multi-class classification.,Results/Conclusion
Under multi-class classification we attempt to assign a single label (51 labels in case of hashtags and 16 labels in case of smileys) to each of vectors in the test set.,Results/Conclusion
Note that the random baseline for this task is 0.02 (0.06)for hashtags (smileys).,Results/Conclusion
Table 2 shows the perfor mance of our framework for these tasks.,Results/Conclusion
Results are significantly above the random baseline and definitely nontrivial considering theequal class sizes in the test set.,Results/Conclusion
"While still relatively low (0.31 for hashtags and 0.64 for smi leys), we observe much better performance forsmileys which is expected due to the lower num ber of sentiment types.",Results/Conclusion
The relatively low performance of hashtags can be explained by ambiguity of the hashtags andsome overlap of sentiments.,Results/Conclusion
Examination of clas sified sentences reveals that many of them can be reasonably assigned to more than one of the available hashtags or smileys.,Results/Conclusion
Thus a tweet ?I?mreading stuff that I DON?T understand again!,Results/Conclusion
ha haha...wth am I doing?,Results/Conclusion
"may reasonably matchtags #sarcasm, #damn, #haha, #lol, #humor, #an gry etc. Close examination of the incorrectly classified examples also reveals that substantialamount of tweets utilize hashtags to explicitly in dicate the specific hashtagged sentiment, in these cases that no sentiment value could be perceived by readers unless indicated explicitly, e.g. ?De Blob game review posted on our blog.",Results/Conclusion
#fun?.,Results/Conclusion
"Obviously, our framework fails to process such cases and captures noise since no sentiment datais present in the processed text labeled with a spe cific sentiment label.Binary classification.",Results/Conclusion
"In the binary classification experiments, we classified a sentence as either appropriate for a particular tag or as not bear Hashtags Avg #hate #jealous #cute #outrageous Pn+W-M-Pt- 0.57 0.6 0.55 0.63 0.53 Pn+W+M-Pt- 0.64 0.64 0.67 0.66 0.6 Pn+W+M+Pt- 0.69 0.66 0.67 0.69 0.64 Pn-W-M-Pt+ 0.73 0.75 0.7 0.69 0.69 FULL 0.8 0.83 0.76 0.71 0.78 Smileys Avg :) ; ) X( : d Pn+W-M-Pt- 0.64 0.66 0.67 0.56 0.65 Pn+W+M-Pt- 0.7 0.73 0.72 0.64 0.69 Pn+W+M+Pt- 0.7 0.74 0.75 0.66 0.69 Pn-W-M-Pt+ 0.75 0.78 0.75 0.68 0.72 FULL 0.86 0.87 0.9 0.74 0.81Table 3: Binary classification results for smileys and hashtags.",Results/Conclusion

ing any sentiment6.,Results/Conclusion
For each of the 50 (15) labelsfor hashtags (smileys) we have performed a bi nary classification when providing as training/testsets only positive examples of the specific senti ment label together with non-sentiment examples.,Results/Conclusion
Table 3 shows averaged results for this case and specific results for selected tags.,Results/Conclusion
We can see thatour framework successfully identifies diverse sentiment types.,Results/Conclusion
"Obviously the results are much bet ter than those of multi-class classification, and the observed > 0.8 precision confirms the usefulnessof the proposed framework for sentiment classifi cation of a variety of different sentiment types.",Results/Conclusion
"We can see that even for binary classification settings, classification of smiley-labeled sentencesis a substantially easier task compared to classifi cation of hashtag-labeled tweets.",Results/Conclusion
"Comparing the contributed performance of different feature typeswe can see that punctuation, word and pattern features, each provide a substantial boost for classi fication quality while we observe only a marginalboost when adding n-grams as classification features.",Results/Conclusion
We can also see that pattern features contribute the performance more than all other fea tures together.,Results/Conclusion
5.2 Evaluation with human judges.,Results/Conclusion
"In the second set of experiments we evaluated our framework on a test set of unseen and untaggedtweets (thus tweets that were not part of the train 6Note that this is a useful application in itself, as a filter that extracts sentiment sentences from a corpus for further focused study/processing.",Results/Conclusion
"246 ing data), comparing its output to tags assigned by human judges.",Results/Conclusion
"We applied our framework with its FULL setting, learning the sentiment tags fromthe training set for hashtags and smileys (sepa rately) and executed the framework on the reduced Tweeter dataset (without untagged data) allowingit to identify at least five sentences for each senti ment class.In order to make the evaluation harsher, we re moved all tweets containing at least one of the relevant classification hashtags (or smileys).",Results/Conclusion
"For each of the resulting 250 sentences for hashtags,and 75 sentences for smileys we generated an ?as signment task?.",Results/Conclusion
Each task presents a human judgewith a sentence and a list of ten possible hash tags.,Results/Conclusion
"One tag from this list was provided by ouralgorithm, 8 other tags were sampled from the re maining 49 (14) available sentiment tags, and the tenth tag is from the list of frequent non-sentiment tags (e.g. travel or obama).",Results/Conclusion
The human judge was requested to select the 0-2 most appropriate tags from the list.,Results/Conclusion
Allowing assignment of multiple tags conforms to the observation that even short sentences may express several different sentimenttypes and to the observation that some of the selected sentiment tags might express similar senti ment types.,Results/Conclusion
We used the Amazon Mechanical Turk service to present the tasks to English-speaking subjects.Each subject was given 50 tasks for Twitter hash tags or 25 questions for smileys.,Results/Conclusion
"To ensure the quality of assignments, we added to each test fivemanually selected, clearly sentiment bearing, as signment tasks from the tagged Twitter sentences used in the training set.",Results/Conclusion
Each set was presented to four subjects.,Results/Conclusion
If a human subject failed to provide the intended ?correct?,Results/Conclusion
answer to at least two of the control set questions we reject him/her from the calculation.,Results/Conclusion
In our evaluation the algorithmis considered to be correct if one of the tags se lected by a human judge was also selected by thealgorithm.,Results/Conclusion
Table 4 shows results for human judge ment classification.,Results/Conclusion
The agreement score for this task was ? = 0.41 (we consider agreement when at least one of two selected items are shared).,Results/Conclusion
Table 4 shows that the majority of tags selectedby humans matched those selected by the algo rithm.,Results/Conclusion
Precision of smiley tags is substantially Setup % Correct % No sentiment Control Smileys 84% 6% 92% Hashtags 77% 10% 90%Table 4: Results of human evaluation.,Results/Conclusion

"higher than of hashtag labels, due to the lessernumber of possible smileys and the lesser ambi guity of smileys in comparison to hashtags.",Results/Conclusion
5.3 Exploration of feature dependencies.,Results/Conclusion
Our algorithm assigns a single sentiment type for each tweet.,Results/Conclusion
"However, as discussed above, some sentiment types overlap (e.g., #awesome and #amazing).",Results/Conclusion
"Many sentences may express several types of sentiment (e.g., #fun and #scary in ?Oh My God http://goo.gl/fb/K2N5z #entertainment #fun #pictures #photography #scary #teaparty?).",Results/Conclusion
We would like to estimate such inter-sentiment dependencies and overlap automatically from the labeled data.,Results/Conclusion
We use two different methods for overlap estimation: tag co-occurrence and feature overlap.,Results/Conclusion
5.3.1 Tag co-occurrenceMany tweets contain more than a single hashtag or a single smiley type.,Results/Conclusion
"As mentioned, we ex clude such tweets from the training set to reduce ambiguity.",Results/Conclusion
However such tag co-appearances canbe used for sentiment overlap estimation.,Results/Conclusion
We cal culated the relative co-occurrence frequencies of some hashtags and smileys.,Results/Conclusion
Table 5 shows some of the observed co-appearance ratios.,Results/Conclusion
As expected some of the observed tags frequently co-appear with other similar tags.,Results/Conclusion
247 Hashtags #happy #sad #crazy # bored#sad 12.8 - - #crazy 14.2 3.5 - #bored 2.4 11.1 2.1 #fun 19.6 2.1 15 4.4 Smileys :) ; ) : ( X(; ) 35.9 - - : ( 31.9 10.5 - X( 8.1 10.2 36 : S 10.5 12.6 21.6 6.1 Table 6: Percentage of shared features in feature vectors for different tags.,Results/Conclusion
"Interestingly, it appears that a relatively high ratio of co-appearance of tags is with opposite meanings (e.g., ?#ilove eating but #ihate feeling fat lol?",Results/Conclusion
or ?happy days of training going to end in a few days #sad #happy?).,Results/Conclusion
This is possibly due to frequently expressed contrast sentiment types in the same sentence ? a fascinating phenomenareflecting the great complexity of the human emo tional state (and expression).,Results/Conclusion
5.3.2 Feature overlapIn our framework we have created a set of fea ture vectors for each of the Twitter sentiment tags.,Results/Conclusion
Comparison of shared features in feature vector sets allows us to estimate dependencies betweendifferent sentiment types even when direct tag cooccurrence data is very sparse.,Results/Conclusion
A feature is considered to be shared between two different senti ment labels if for both sentiment labels there is at least a single example in the training set whichhas a positive value of this feature.,Results/Conclusion
In order to automatically analyze such dependencies we calcu late the percentage of sharedWord/n-gram/Pattern features between different sentiment labels.,Results/Conclusion
Table 6 shows the observed feature overlap values for selected sentiment tags.,Results/Conclusion
"We observe the trend of results obtained by comparison of shared feature vectors is similar to those obtained by means of label co-occurrence, although the numbers of the shared features arehigher.",Results/Conclusion
"These results, demonstrating the patternbased similarity of conflicting, sometimes contradicting, emotions are interesting from a psycho logical and cognitive perspective.",Results/Conclusion
We presented a framework which allows an au tomatic identification and classification of various sentiment types in short text fragments which isbased on Twitter data.,Results/Conclusion
Our framework is a su pervised classification one which utilizes Twitterhashtags and smileys as training labels.,Results/Conclusion
"The substantial coverage and size of the processed Twitter data allowed us to identify dozens of senti ment types without any labor-intensive manuallylabeled training sets or pre-provided sentiment specific features or sentiment words.We evaluated diverse feature types for senti ment extraction including punctuation, patterns,words and n-grams, confirming that each feature type contributes to the sentiment classifica tion framework.",Results/Conclusion
We also proposed two different methods which allow an automatic identification of sentiment type overlap and inter-dependencies.In the future these methods can be used for automated clustering of sentiment types and senti ment dependency rules.,Results/Conclusion
"While hashtag labels arespecific to Twitter data, the obtained feature vectors are not heavily Twitter-specific and in the fu ture we would like to explore the applicability ofTwitter data for sentiment multi-class identifica tion and classification in other domains.",Results/Conclusion
