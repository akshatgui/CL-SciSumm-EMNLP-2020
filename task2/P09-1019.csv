Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) and Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding are used in most current state-of-theart Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems.,{}
"The algorithms were originally to work with lists of translations, and recently extended to lattices that encode many more hypotheses typical lists.",{}
We here extend lattice-based MERT and MBR algorithms to work with hypergraphs that encode a vast number of translations produced by MT systems based on Synchronous Context Free Grammars.,{}
These algorithms are more efficient than the lattice-based versions presented earlier.,{}
We show how MERT can be employed to optimize parameters for MBR decoding.,{}
Our experiments show speedups from MERT and MBR as well as performance improvements from MBR decoding on several language pairs.,{}
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems have improved considerably by directly using the error criterion in both training and decoding.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"In this section, we present an extension of the algorithm described in Macherey et al. (2008) that allows us to efficiently compute and represent upper envelopes over all candidate translations encoded in hypergraphs.","{'title': '3 Minimum Error Rate Training', 'number': '3'}"

We first review Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding for statistical MT.,"{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"

"This reranking can be done for any sentencelevel loss function such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), Word Error Rate, or Position-independent Error Rate.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"Recently, Tromble et al. (2008) extended MBR decoding to translation lattices under an approximate BLEU score.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
They approximated log(BLEU) score by a linear function of n-gram matches and candidate length.,"{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"

"Under such a linear decomposition, the MBR decoder (Equation 1) can be written as Tromble et al. (2008) implement the MBR decoder using Weighted Finite State Automata (WFSA) operations.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"First, the set of n-grams is extracted from the lattice.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"Next, the posterior probability of each n-gram is computed.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
A new automaton is then created by intersecting each ngram with weight (from Equation 2) to an unweighted lattice.,"{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"Finally, the MBR hypothesis is extracted as the best path in the automaton.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
We will refer to this procedure as FSAMBR.,"{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
The above steps are carried out one n-gram at a time.,"{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"For a moderately large lattice, there can be several thousands of n-grams and the procedure becomes expensive.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
We now present an alternate approximate procedure which can avoid this where the posterior probability of an n-gram in the lattice is given by enumeration making the resulting algorithm much faster than FSAMBR.,"{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"The key idea behind this new algorithm is to rewrite the n-gram posterior probability (Equation 4) as follows: where f(e, w, E) is a score assigned to edge e on path E containing n-gram w: { 1 w ∈ e,p(e|G) > p(e'|G), e' precedes e on E 0 otherwise In other words, for each path E, we count the edge that contributes n-gram w and has the highest edge posterior probability relative to its predecessors on the path E; there is exactly one such edge on each lattice path E. We note that f(e, w, E) relies on the full path E which means that it cannot be computed based on local statistics.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"We therefore approximate the quantity f(e, w, E) with f*(e, w,G) that counts the edge e with n-gram w that has the highest arc posterior probability relative to predecessors in the entire lattice G. f*(e, w,G) can be computed locally, and the n-gram posterior probability based on f* can be determined as follows: Algorithm 3 MBR Decoding on Lattices (Algorithm 3).","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"However, there are important differences when computing the n-gram posterior probabilities (Step 3).","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"In this inside pass, we now maintain both n-gram prefixes and suffixes (up to the maximum order −1) on each hypergraph node.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"This is necessary because unlike a lattice, new ngrams may be created at subsequent nodes by concatenating words both to the left and the right side of the n-gram.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"When the arity of the edge is 2, a rule has the general form aX1bX2c, where X1 and X2 are sequences from tail nodes.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"As a result, we need to consider all new sequences which can be created by the cross-product of the n-grams on the two tail nodes.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"E.g. if X1 = {c, cd, d} and X2 = {f, g}, then a total of six sequences will result.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"In practice, such a cross-product is not prowhere P(e|G) is the posterior probability of a lattice edge.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
The algorithm to perform Lattice MBR is given in Algorithm 3.,"{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"
"For each node t in the lattice, we maintain a quantity Score(w, t) for each n-gram w that lies on a path from the source node to t. Score(w, t) is the highest posterior probability among all edges on the paths that terminate on t and contain n-gram w. The forward pass requires computing the n-grams introduced by each edge; to do this, we propagate n-grams (up to maximum order −1) terminating on each node.","{'title': '4 Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding', 'number': '4'}"

"In both tables, the following results are reported: Lattice/HGMBR with default parameters (−5,1.5, 2, 3, 4) computed using corpus statistics (Tromble et al., 2008), Lattice/HGMBR with parameters derived from MERT both without/with the baseline model cost feature (mert−b, mert+b).","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"For multi-language systems, we only show the # of language-pairs with gains/no-changes/drops for each MBR variant with respect to the MAP translation.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
We observed in the NIST systems that MERT resulted in short translations relative to MAP on the unseen test set.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"To prevent this behavior, we modify the MERT error criterion to include a sentence-level brevity scorer with parameter α: BLEU+brevity(α).","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"This brevity scorer penalizes each candidate translation that is shorter than the average length over its reference translations, using a penalty term which is linear in the difference between either length.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
We tune α on the development set so that the brevity score of MBR translation is close to that of the MAP translation.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"In the NIST systems, MERT yields small improvements on top of MBR with default parameters.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
This is the case for Arabic-English Hiero/SAMT.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"In all other cases, we see no change or even a slight degradation due to MERT.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"We hypothesize that the default MBR parameters (Tromble et al., 2008) are well tuned.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
Therefore there is little gain by additional tuning using MERT.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"In the multi-language systems, the results show a different trend.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"We observe that MBR with default parameters results in gains on 18 pairs, no differences on 9 pairs, and losses on 12 pairs.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"When we optimize MBR features with MERT, the number of language pairs with gains/no changes/drops is 22/5/12.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"Thus, MERT has a bigger impact here than in the NIST systems.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
We hypothesize that the default MBR parameters are sub-optimal for some language pairs and that MERT helps to find better parameter settings.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"In particular, MERT avoids the need for manually tuning these parameters by language pair.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"Finally, when baseline model costs are added as an extra feature (mert+b), the number of pairs with gains/no changes/drops is 26/8/5.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
This shows that this feature can allow MBR decoding to backoff to the MAP translation.,"{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"
"When MBR does not produce a higher BLEU score relative to MAP on the development set, MERT assigns a higher weight to this feature function.","{'title': '6 Experiments', 'number': '6'}"

"Lattice MBR decoding is obtained under a linear approximation to BLEU, where the weights are obtained using n-gram precisions derived from development data.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"This may not be optimal in practice for unseen test sets and language pairs, and the resulting linear loss may be quite different from the corpus level BLEU.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"In this paper, we have described how MERT can be employed to estimate the weights for the linear loss function to maximize BLEU on a development set.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
"On an experiment with 40 language pairs, we obtain improvements on 26 pairs, no difference on 8 pairs and drops on 5 pairs.","{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
This was achieved without any need for manual tuning for each language pair.,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
The baseline model cost feature helps the algorithm effectively back off to the MAP translation in language pairs where MBR features alone would not have helped.,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
MERT and MBR decoding are popular techniques for incorporating the final evaluation metric into the development of SMT systems.,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
We believe that our efficient algorithms will make them more widely applicable in both SCFG-based and phrase-based MT systems.,"{'title': '7 Discussion', 'number': '7'}"
