We present a system for the semantic role la beling task.,{}
The system combines a machine learning technique with an inference procedurebased on integer linear programming that supports the incorporation of linguistic and struc tural constraints into the decision process.,{}
Thesystem is tested on the data provided in CoNLL 2004 shared task on semantic role labeling and achieves very competitive results.,{}
"Semantic parsing of sentences is believed to be animportant task toward natural language understand ing, and has immediate applications in tasks such information extraction and question answering.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We study semantic role labeling(SRL).,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For each verb in a sentence, the goal is to identify all constituents that fill a semantic role, and to determine their roles,such as Agent, Patient or Instrument, and their ad juncts, such as Locative, Temporal or Manner.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The PropBank project (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) provides a large human-annotated corpus of semantic verb-argument relations.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Specifically, we use the data provided in the CoNLL-2004 shared task of semantic-role labeling (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2003) which consists of a portion of thePropBank corpus, allowing us to compare the per formance of our approach with other systems.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Previous approaches to the SRL task have madeuse of a full syntactic parse of the sentence in or der to define argument boundaries and to determine the role labels (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003;Pradhan et al, 2003; Pradhan et al, 2004; Sur deanu et al, 2003).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this work, following the CoNLL-2004 shared task definition, we assume thatthe SRL system takes as input only partial syn tactic information, and no external lexico-semantic knowledge bases.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Specifically, we assume as input resources a part-of-speech tagger, a shallow parser that can process the input to the level of basedchunks and clauses (Tjong Kim Sang and Buch holz, 2000; Tjong Kim Sang and De?jean, 2001), and a named-entity recognizer (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We do not assume a full parse as input.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"SRL is a difficult task, and one cannot expecthigh levels of performance from either purely man ual classifiers or purely learned classifiers.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Rather, supplemental linguistic information must be used to support and correct a learning system.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

features.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The key innovation in our ap proach is the development of a principled method tocombine machine learning techniques with linguistic and structural constraints by explicitly incorpo rating inference into the decision process.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In the machine learning part, the system we present here is composed of two phases.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"First, a set of argument candidates is produced using twolearned classifiers?one to discover beginning po sitions and one to discover end positions of each argument type.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Hopefully, this phase discovers a small superset of all arguments in the sentence (foreach verb).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In a second learning phase, the candi date arguments from the first phase are re-scored using a classifier designed to determine argument type, given a candidate argument.Unfortunately, it is difficult to utilize global prop erties of the sentence into the learning phases.However, the inference level it is possible to incorporate the fact that the set of possible rolelabelings is restricted by both structural and lin guistic constraints?for example, arguments cannotstructurally overlap, or, given a predicate, some ar gument structures are illegal.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The overall decision problem must produce an outcome that consistent with these constraints.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We encode the constraints aslinear inequalities, and use integer linear programming(ILP) as an inference procedure to make a final decision that is both consistent with the con straints and most likely according to the learningsystem.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Although ILP is generally a computationally hard problem, there are efficient implementations that can run on thousands of variables and constraints.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In our experiments, we used the commer cial ILP package (Xpress-MP, 2003), and were able to process roughly twenty sentences per second.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The goal of the semantic-role labeling task is to dis cover the verb-argument structure for a given input sentence.,"{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, given a sentence ? I left my pearls to my daughter-in-law in my will?, the goal is to identify different arguments of the verb left which yields the output:[A0 I] [V left ] [A1 my pearls] [A2 to my daughter in-law] [AM-LOC in my will].","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Here A0 represents the leaver, A1 represents the thing left, A2 represents the benefactor, AM-LOC is an adjunct indicating the location of the action, and V determines the verb.","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Following the definition of the PropBank, and CoNLL-2004 shared task, there are six different types of arguments labelled as A0-A5 and AA.","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
These labels have different semantics for each verbas specified in the PropBank Frame files.,"{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In addi tion, there are also 13 types of adjuncts labelled as AM-XXX where XXX specifies the adjunct type.In some cases, an argument may span over differ ent parts of a sentence, the label C-XXX is used to specify the continuity of the arguments, as shown in the example below.","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"[A1 The pearls] , [A0 I] [V said] , [C-A1 were left to my daughter-in-law].","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Moreover in some cases, an argument might be a relative pronoun that in fact refers to the actual agentoutside the clause.","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In this case, the actual agent is la beled as the appropriate argument type, XXX, while the relative pronoun is instead labeled as R-XXX.","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, [A1 The pearls] [R-A1 which] [A0 I] [V left] , [A2 to my daughter-in-law] are fake.","{'title': 'Task Description. ', 'number': '2'}"

Our semantic role labeling system consists of two phases.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
The first phase finds a subset of arguments from all possible candidates.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The goal here is tofilter out as many as possible false argument candidates, while still maintaining high recall.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
The sec ond phase focuses on identifying the types of thoseargument candidates.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Since the number of candi dates is much fewer, the second phase is able to use slightly complicated features to facilitate learning a better classifier.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
This section first introduces the learning system we use and then describes how we learn the classifiers in these two phases.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
3.1 SNoW Learning Architecture.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"The learning algorithm used is a variation of the Winnow update rule incorporated in SNoW (Roth, 1998; Roth and Yih, 2002), a multi-class classifier that is specifically tailored for large scale learningtasks.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"SNoW learns a sparse network of linear functions, in which the targets (argument border predic tions or argument type predictions, in this case) arerepresented as linear functions over a common fea ture space.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
It incorporates several improvements over the basic Winnow multiplicative update rule.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In particular, a regularization term is added, which has the effect of trying to separate the data with a thick separator (Grove and Roth, 2001; Hang et al,2002).","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
In the work presented here we use this regu larization with a fixed parameter.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Experimental evidence has shown that SNoW activations are monotonic with the confidence in the prediction.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, it can provide a goodsource of probability estimation.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"We use soft max (Bishop, 1995) over the raw activation values as conditional probabilities, and also the score of the target.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Specifically, suppose the number of classes is n, and the raw activation values of class i is acti.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
The posterior estimation for class i is derived by the following equation.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
score(i) = pi = e acti ? 1?j?n eactj The score plays an important role in different places.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the first phase uses the scoresto decide which argument candidates should be filtered out.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, the scores output by the second phase classifier are used in the inference procedure to reason for the best global labeling.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
3.2 First Phase: Find Argument Candidates.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
The first phase is to predict the argument candidates of a given sentence that correspond to the active verb.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Unfortunately, it turns out that it is difficult to predict the exact arguments accurately.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, the goal here is to output a superset of the correct arguments by filtering out unlikely candidates.Specifically, we learn two classifiers, one to de tect beginning argument locations and the otherto detect end argument locations.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Each multi class classifier makes predictions over forty-three classes?thirty-two argument types, ten continuousargument types, and one class to detect not begin ning/not end.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Features used for these classifiers are: ? Word feature includes the current word, two words before and two words after.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Part-of-speech tag (POS) feature includes the POS tags of all words in a window of size two.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Chunk feature includes the BIO tags for chunks of all words in a window of size two.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Predicate lemma & POS tag show the lemma form and POS tag of the active predicate.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Voice feature is the voice (active/passive) of the current predicate.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
This is extracted with a simple rule: a verb is identified as passive if it follows a to-be verb in the same phrase chunk and its POS tag is VBN(past participle) or it immediately follows a noun phrase.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Position feature describes if the current word is before or after the predicate.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Chunk pattern encodes the sequence of chunks from the current words to the predicate.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Clause tag indicates the boundary of clauses.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Clause path feature is a path formed from a semi-parsed tree containing only clauses and chunks.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Each clause is named with the chunk preceding it.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
The clause path is the path from predicate to target word in the semi-parse tree.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Clause position feature is the position of the target word relative to the predicate in the semi-parse tree containing only clauses.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Thereare four configurations ? target word and pred icate share the same parent, target word parent is an ancestor of predicate, predicate parent is an ancestor of target word, or otherwise.Because each argument consists of a single be ginning and a single ending, these classifiers can be used to construct a set of potential arguments (by combining each predicted begin with each predicted end after it of the same type).","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Although this phase identifies typed arguments (i.e. labeled with argument types), the second phasewill re-score each phrase using phrase-based classifiers ? therefore, the goal of the first phase is sim ply to identify non-typed phrase candidates.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In thistask, we achieves 98.96% and 88.65% recall (overall, without verb) on the training and the develop ment set, respectively.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Because these are the onlycandidates passed to the second phase, the final sys tem performance is upper-bounded by 88.65%.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
3.3 Second Phase: Argument Classification.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
The second phase of our system assigns the final argument classes to (a subset) of the argument can didates supplied from the first phase.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Again, theSNoW learning architecture is used to train a multi class classifier to label each argument to one of the argument types, plus a special class?no argument(null).","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Training examples are created from the argu ment candidates supplied from the first phase using the following features: ? Predicate lemma & POS tag, voice, position, clause Path, clause position, chunk pattern Same features as those in the first phase.?","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Word & POS tag from the argument, includ ing the first,last,and head1 word and tag.?","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Named entity feature tells if the target argu ment is, embeds, overlaps, or is embedded in a named entity with its type.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Chunk tells if the target argument is, embeds, overlaps, or is embedded in a chunk with its type.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Lengths of the target argument, in the numbers of words and chunks separately.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Verb class feature is the class of the active predicate described in PropBank Frames.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Phrase type uses simple heuristics to identify the target argument as VP, PP, or NP.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Sub-categorization describes the phrase structure around the predicate.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"We separate the clause where the predicate is in into three parts?the predicate chunk, segments before and after the predicate, and use the sequence of phrase types of these three segments.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Baseline features identified not in the main verb chunk as AM-NEG and modal verb in the main verb chunk as AM-MOD.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Clause coverage describes how much of the local clause (from the predicate) is covered by the target argument.?,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Chunk pattern length feature counts the num ber of patterns in the argument.?,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Conjunctions join every pair of the above fea tures as new features.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
Boundary words & POS tag include twowords/tags before and after the target argu ment.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Bigrams are pairs of words/tags in the window from two words before the target to the first word of the target, and also from the last word to two words after the argument.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"1We use simple rules to first decide if a candidate phrase type is VP, NP, or PP.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
The headword of an NP phrase is the right-most noun.,"{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Similarly, the left-most verb/proposition of a VP/PP phrase is extracted as the headword ? Sparse collocation picks one word/tag from the two words before the argument, the first word/tag, the last word/tag of the argument, and one word/tag from the two words after the argument to join as features.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Although the predictions of the second-phaseclassifier can be used directly, the labels of argu ments in a sentence often violate some constraints.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, we rely on the inference procedure to make the final predictions.","{'title': 'System Architecture. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Ideally, if the learned classifiers are perfect, arguments can be labeled correctly according to the classifiers?","{'title': 'Inference via ILP. ', 'number': '4'}"

"In reality, labels assigned to ar guments in a sentence often contradict each other,and violate the constraints arising from the struc tural and linguistic information.","{'title': 'Inference via ILP. ', 'number': '4'}"
"In order to resolve the conflicts, we design an inference procedure thattakes the confidence scores of each individual argument given by the second-phase classifier as in put, and outputs the best global assignment that also satisfies the constraints.","{'title': 'Inference via ILP. ', 'number': '4'}"
In this section we firstintroduce the constraints and the inference prob lem in the semantic role labeling task.,"{'title': 'Inference via ILP. ', 'number': '4'}"

4.1 Constraints over Argument Labeling.,"{'title': 'Inference via ILP. ', 'number': '4'}"
"Formally, the argument classifier attempts to assign labels to a set of arguments, S1:M , indexed from 1 to M . Each argument Si can take any label from a set of argument labels, P , and the indexed set of arguments can take a set of labels, c1:M ? PM . If we assume that the classifier returns a score, score(Si = ci), corresponding to the likelihood ofseeing label ci for argument Si, then, given a sentence, the unaltered inference task is solved by max imizing the overall score of the arguments, c?1:M = argmax c1:M?PM score(S1:M = c1:M ) = argmax c1:M?PM M?","{'title': 'Inference via ILP.
