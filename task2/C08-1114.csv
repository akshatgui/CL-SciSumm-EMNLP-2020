"Recognizing analogies, synonyms, anto nyms, and associations appear to be fourdistinct tasks, requiring distinct NLP al gorithms.",{}
"In the past, the four tasks have been treated independently, using a widevariety of algorithms.",{}
"These four seman tic classes, however, are a tiny sample of the full range of semantic phenomena, andwe cannot afford to create ad hoc algo rithms for each semantic phenomenon; weneed to seek a unified approach.",{}
We propose to subsume a broad range of phenom ena under analogies.,{}
"To limit the scope of this paper, we restrict our attention to the subsumption of synonyms, antonyms, and associations.",{}
"We introduce a supervised corpus-based machine learning algorithm for classifying analogous word pairs, and we show that it can solve multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, TOEFL synonymquestions, ESL synonym-antonym questions, and similar-associated-both ques tions from cognitive psychology.",{}

"There is past work on recognizing analogies(Reitman, 1965), synonyms (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), antonyms (Lin et al, 2003), and asso ciations (Lesk, 1969), but each of these four tasks has been examined separately, in isolation from the others.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As far as we know, the algorithm proposed here is the first attempt to deal with all four tasks using a uniform approach.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We believe that it isimportant to seek NLP algorithms that can han dle a broad range of semantic phenomena, becausedeveloping a specialized algorithm for each phe nomenon is a very inefficient research strategy.It might seem that a lexicon, such as Word Net (Fellbaum, 1998), contains all the information we need to handle these four tasks.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, weprefer to take a corpus-based approach to seman tics.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Veale (2004) used WordNet to answer 374 multiple-choice SAT analogy questions, achievingan accuracy of 43%, but the best corpus-based ap proach attains an accuracy of 56% (Turney, 2006).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Another reason to prefer a corpus-based approachto a lexicon-based approach is that the former re quires less human labour, and thus it is easier to extend to other languages.In Section 2, we describe our algorithm for rec ognizing analogies.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"An analogy, A:B::C:D, asserts that A is to B as C is to D; for example, traffic:street::water:riverbed asserts that traffic is to street as water is to riverbed; that is, the semantic relations between traffic and street are highly similar to the semantic relations between water and riverbed.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs.

We approach this as a standard classificationproblem for supervised machine learning.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
The al gorithm takes as input a training set of word pairs with class labels and a testing set of word pairs without labels.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
Each word pair is represented as a vector in a feature space and a supervised learning algorithm is used to classify the feature vectors.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
The elements in the feature vectors are based on the frequencies of automatically defined patterns in a large corpus.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
The output of the algorithm is anassignment of labels to the word pairs in the test ing set.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For some of the experiments, we selecta unique label for each word pair; for other ex periments, we assign probabilities to each possible label for each word pair.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For a given word pair, such as mason:stone, the first step is to generate morphological variations,such as masons:stones.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In the following experi ments, we use morpha (morphological analyzer)and morphg (morphological generator) for mor phological processing (Minnen et al, 2001).1 The second step is to search in a large corpus for all phrases of the following form: ?[0 to 1 words] X [0 to 3 words] Y [0 to 1 words]?","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs.

"In this template, X:Y consists of morphologicalvariations of the given word pair, in either order; for example, mason:stone, stone:mason, masons:stones, and so on.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
A typical phrase for ma son:stone would be ?the mason cut the stone with?.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"

"If a phrase contains n words, then it yields 2(n?2) patterns.Each pattern corresponds to a feature in the feature vectors that we will generate.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Since a typical input set of word pairs yields millions of pat terns, we need to use feature selection, to reduce the number of patterns to a manageable quantity.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"

The algorithm is not sensitive to the precise value of k.The reasoning behind the feature selection al gorithm is that shared patterns make more useful features than rare patterns.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The number of features (kN ) depends on the number of word pairs (N ), because, if we have more feature vectors, then we need more features to distinguish them.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Turney (2006) also selects patterns based on the numberof pairs that generate them, but the number of se lected patterns is a constant (8000), independent of the number of input word pairs.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The next step is to generate feature vectors, one vector for each input word pair.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Each of the N feature vectors has kN elements, one element for each selected pattern.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
The value of an element in a vector is given by the logarithm of the frequency in the corpus of the corresponding pattern for the given word pair.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, suppose the given pair is mason:stone and the pattern is ?* X cut * Y *?.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"

Each feature vector is then normal ized to unit length.,"{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The normalization ensures that features in vectors for high-frequency word pairs (traffic:street) are comparable to features in vectors for low-frequency word pairs (water:riverbed).Now that we have a feature vector for each in put word pair, we can apply a standard supervised learning algorithm.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs.

"In the following experiments, we use a sequential minimal optimization (SMO)support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel (Platt, 1998), as implemented in Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowl edge Analysis) (Witten and Frank, 1999).4 The algorithm generates probability estimates for each class by fitting logistic regression models to the outputs of the SVM.","{'title': 'Classifying Analogous Word Pairs.

Their features were based on 128 hand-coded patterns.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
They used a nearest-neighbour learning algorithm to classify general-domain noun-modifier pairsinto 30 different classes of semantic relations.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
"Tur ney (2006) later addressed the same problem using 8000 automatically generated patterns.One of the tasks in SemEval 2007 was the clas sification of semantic relations between nominals (Girju et al, 2007).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
The problem is to classifysemantic relations between nouns and noun com pounds in the context of a sentence.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
"The task attracted 14 teams who created 15 systems, all of which used supervised machine learning with features that were lexicon-based, corpus-based, or both.PairClass is most similar to the algorithm of Tur ney (2006), but it differs in the following ways:?","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
PairClass does not use a lexicon to find syn onyms for the input word pairs.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
One of our goals in this paper is to show that a pure corpus-based algorithm can handle synonymswithout a lexicon.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
This considerably simpli fies the algorithm.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
PairClass uses a support vector machine (SVM) instead of a nearest neighbour (NN) learning algorithm.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
PairClass does not use the singular value decomposition (SVD) to smooth the feature vectors.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
It has been our experience that SVD is not necessary with SVMs.,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
"PairClass generates probability estimates,whereas Turney (2006) uses a cosine mea sure of similarity.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
"Probability estimates canbe readily used in further downstream pro cessing, but cosines are less useful.?","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
The automatically generated patterns in PairClass are slightly more general than the pat terns of Turney (2006).,"{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
"The morphological processing in PairClass (Minnen et al, 2001) is more sophisticated than in Turney (2006).","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"

"However, we believe that the main contribution of this paper is not PairClass itself, but the extension of supervised word pair classification beyond theclassification of noun-modifier pairs and semantic relations between nominals, to analogies, syn onyms, antonyms, and associations.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
"As far as we know, this has not been done before.","{'title': 'Related Work. ', 'number': '5'}"
The main limitation of PairClass is the need for a large corpus.,"{'title': 'Limitations and Future Work. ', 'number': '6'}"
"Phrases that contain a pair of wordstend to be more rare than phrases that contain either of the members of the pair, thus a large cor pus is needed to ensure that sufficient numbers of phrases are found for each input word pair.","{'title': 'Limitations and Future Work. ', 'number': '6'}"
The size of the corpus has a cost in terms of disk spaceand processing time.,"{'title': 'Limitations and Future Work. ', 'number': '6'}"
"In the future, as hardware im proves, this will become less of an issue, but there may be ways to improve the algorithm, so that a smaller corpus is sufficient.Another area for future work is to apply Pair Class to more tasks.","{'title': 'Limitations and Future Work. ', 'number': '6'}"
"WordNet includes more thana dozen semantic relations (e.g., synonyms, hy ponyms, hypernyms, meronyms, holonyms, and antonyms).","{'title': 'Limitations and Future Work. ', 'number': '6'}"
PairClass should be applicable to allof these relations.,"{'title': 'Limitations and Future Work. ', 'number': '6'}"
"Other potential applications in clude any task that involves semantic relations, such as word sense disambiguation, informationretrieval, information extraction, and metaphor in terpretation.","{'title': 'Limitations and Future Work. ', 'number': '6'}"
"In this paper, we have described a uniform approach to analogies, synonyms, antonyms, and as sociations, in which all of these phenomena are subsumed by analogies.","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
We view the problem ofrecognizing analogies as the classification of se mantic relations between words.,"{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"We believe that most of our lexical knowledge is relational, not attributional.","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"That is, meaning is largely about relations among words, rather thanproperties of individual words, considered in isolation.","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"For example, consider the knowledge en coded in WordNet: much of the knowledge in WordNet is embedded in the graph structure that connects words.","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
Analogies of the form A:B::C:D are calledproportional analogies.,"{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"These types of lowerlevel analogies may be contrasted with higher level analogies, such as the analogy between the solar system and Rutherford?s model of the atom (Falkenhainer et al, 1989), which are sometimes called conceptual analogies.","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
We believe that the difference between these two types is largely a matter of complexity.,"{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
A higher-level analogy is composed of many lower-level analogies.,"{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
Progresswith algorithms for processing lower-level analo gies will eventually contribute to algorithms for higher-level analogies.The idea of subsuming a broad range of semantic phenomena under analogies has been sug gested by many researchers.,"{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"Minsky (1986) wrote, ?How do we ever understand anything?","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"Almost always, I think, by using one or another kind of analogy.?","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"Hofstadter (2007) claimed, ?all meaningcomes from analogies.?","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
"In NLP, analogical algo rithms have been applied to machine translation(Lepage and Denoual, 2005), morphology (Lep age, 1998), and semantic relations (Turney and Littman, 2005).","{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
Analogy provides a frameworkthat has the potential to unify the field of seman tics.,"{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
This paper is a small step towards that goal.,"{'title': 'Conclusion. ', 'number': '7'}"
