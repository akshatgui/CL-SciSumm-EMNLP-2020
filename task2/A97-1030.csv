Name identification requires resolution of a subset of the types of structural and semantic ambiguities encountered in the analysis of nouns and noun phrases (NPs) in natural language processing.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Like common nouns, ((Jensen and Binot 1987), (Hindle and Rooth 1993) and (Brill and Resnick 1994)), proper names exhibit structural ambiguity in prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and in conjunction scope.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"A PP may be attached to the preceding NP and form part of a single large name, as in NP [Midwest Center PP[for NP[Computer Research]]].","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Alternatively it may be independent of the preceding NP, as in NP[Carnegie Hall] PP[for NP[Irwin Berlin]], where for separates two distinct names, Carnegie Hall and Irwin Berlin.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"As with PP-attachment of common noun phrases, the ambiguity is not always resolved, even in human sentence parsing (cf. the famous example I saw the girl in the park with the telescope).","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"The location of an organization, for instance, could be part of its name (City University of New York) or an phrases.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"The components of Victoria and Albert Museum and IBM and Bell Laboratories look identical; however, and is part of the name of the museum in the first example, but a conjunction joining two computer company names in the second.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Although this problem is well known, a search of the computational literature shows that few solutions have been proposed, perhaps because the conjunct ambiguity problem is harder than PP attachment (though see (Agarwal and Boggess 1992) for a method of conjunct identification that relies on syntactic category and semantic label).","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Similar structural ambiguity exists with respect to the possessive pronoun, which may indicate a relationship between two names (e.g., Israel's Shimon Peres) or may constitute a component of a single name (e.g., Donoghue's Money Fund Report).","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
The resolution of structural ambiguity such as PP attachment and conjunction scope is required in order to automatically establish the exact boundaries of proper names.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Once these boundaries have been established, there is another type of well-known structural ambiguity, involving the internal structure of the proper name.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, Professor of Far Eastern Art John Blake is parsed as [[Professor [of Far Eastern Art]] John Blake] whereas Professor Art Klein is [[Professor] Art Klein].","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
Proper names also display semantic ambiguity.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Identification of the type of proper nouns resembles the problem of sense disambiguation for common nouns where, for instance, state taken out of context may refer either to a government body or the condition of a person or entity.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"A name variant taken out of context may be one of many types, e.g., Ford by itself could be a person (Gerald Ford), an organization (Ford Motors), a make of car (Ford), or a place (Ford, Michigan).","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Entity-type ambiguity is quite common, as places are named after famous people and companies are named after their owners or locations.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"

"In addition, proper names resemble definite noun phrases in that their intended referent may be ambiguous.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"The man may refer to more than one male individual previously mentioned in the discourse or present in the non-linguistic context; J. Smith may similarly refer to more than one individual named Joseph Smith, John Smith, Jane Smith, etc.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
Semantic ambiguity of names is very common because of the standard practice of using shorter names to stand for longer ones.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
Shared knowledge and context are crucial disambiguation factors.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Paris, usually refers to the capital of France, rather than a city in Texas or the Trojan prince, but in a particular context, such as a discussion of Greek mythology, the presumed referent changes.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Beyond the ambiguities that proper names share with common nouns, some ambiguities are particular to names: noun phrases may be ambiguous between a name reading and a common noun phrase, as in Candy, the person's name, versus candy the food, or The House as an organization versus a house referring to a building.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"In English, capitalization usually disambiguates the two, though not at sentence beginnings: at the beginning of a sentence, the components and capitalization patterns of New Coke and New Sears are identical; only world knowledge informs us that New Coke is a product and Sears is a company.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"Furthermore, capitalization does not always disambiguate names from non-names because what constitutes a name as opposed to a • non-name is not always clear.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"According to (Quirk et al. 1972) names, which consist of proper nouns (classified into personal names like Shakespeare, temporal names like Monday, or geographical names like Australia) have 'unique' reference.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
Proper nouns differ in their linguistic behavior from common nouns in that they mostly do not take determiners or have a plural form.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"However, some names do take determiners, as in The New York Times; in this case, they &quot;are perfectly regular in taking the definite article since they are basically premodified count nouns...","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"The difference between an ordinary common noun and an ordinary common noun turned name is that the unique reference of the name has been institutionalized, as is made overt in writing by initial capital letter.&quot; Quirk et al. 's description of names seems to indicate that capitalized words like Egyptian (an adjective) or Frenchmen (a noun referring to a set of individuals) are not names.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"It leaves capitalized sequences like Minimum Alternative Tax, Annual Report, and Chairman undetermined as to whether or not they are names.","{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
All of these ambiguities must be dealt with if proper names are to be identified correctly.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
In the rest of the paper we describe the resources and heuristics we have designed and implemented in Nominator and the extent to which they resolve these ambiguities.,"{'title': '2 The Ambiguity of Proper Names', 'number': '2'}"
"In general, two types of resources are available for disambiguation: context and world knowledge.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"Each of these can be exploited along a continuum, from 'cheaper' to computationally and manually more expensive usage.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"'Cheaper' models, which include no context or world knowledge, do very little disambiguation.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"More 'expensive' models, which use full syntactic parsing, discourse models, inference and reasoning, require computational and human resources that may not always be available, as when massive amounts of text have to be rapidly processed on a regular basis.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In addition, given the current state of the art, full parsing and extensive world knowledge would still not yield complete automatic ambiguity resolution.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In designing Nominator, we have tried to achieve a balance between high accuracy and speed by adopting a model which uses minimal context and world knowledge.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
Nominator uses no syntactic contextual information.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"It applies a set of heuristics to a list of (multi-word) strings, based on patterns of capitalization, punctuation and location within the sentence and the document.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
This design choice differentiates our approach from that of several similar projects.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"Most proper name recognizers that have been reported on in print either take as input text tagged by part-of-speech (e.g., the systems of (Paik et al. 1993) and (Mani et al.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"1993)) or perform syntactic and/or morphological analysis on all words, including capitalized ones, that are part of candidate proper names (e.g., (Coates-Stephens 1993) and (McDonald 1993)).","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"Several (e.g., (McDonald 1993), (Mani et al. 1993), (Paik et al.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"1993) and (Cowie et al. 1992)) look in the local context of the candidate proper name for external information such as appositives (e.g., in a sequence such as Robin Clark, president of Clark Co.) or for human-subject verbs (e.g., say, plan) in order to determine the category of the candidate proper name.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
Nominator does not use this type of external context.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"Instead, Nominator makes use of a different kind of contextual information — proper names cooccuring in the document.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
It is a fairly standard convention in an edited document for one of the first references to an entity (excluding a reference in the title) to include a relatively full form of its name.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In a kind of discourse anaphora, other references to the entity take the form of shorter, more ambiguous variants.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
Nominator identifies the referent of the full form (see below) and then takes advantage of the discourse context provided by the list of names to associate shorter more ambiguous name occurrences with their intended referents.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In terms of world knowledge, the most obvious resource is a database of known names.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In fact, this is what many commercially available name identification applications use (e.g., Hayes 1994).","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"A reliable database provides both accuracy and efficiency, if fast look-up methods are incorporated.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"A database also has the potential to resolve structural ambiguity; for example, if IBM and Apple Computers are listed individually in the database but IBM and Apple Computers is not, it may indicate a conjunction of two distinct names.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"A database may also contain default world knowledge information: e.g., with no other over-riding information, it may be safe to assume that the string McDonald's refers to an organization.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"But even if an existing database is reliable, names that are not yet in it must be discovered and information in the database must be over-ridden when appropriate.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, if a new name such as IBM Credit Corp. occurs in the text but not in the database, while IBM exists in the database, automatic identification of IBM should be blocked in favor of the new name IBM Credit Corp.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"If a name database exists, Nominator can take advantage of it.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"However, our goal has been to design Nominator to function optimally in the absence of such a resource.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In this case, Nominator consults a small authority file which contains information on about 3000 special 'name words' and their relevant lexical features.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"Listed are personal titles (e.g., Mr., King), organizational identifiers (including strong identifiers such as Inc. and weaker domain identifiers such as Arts) and names of large places (e.g., Los Angeles, California, but not Scarsdale, N.Y.).","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"Also listed are exception words, such as upper-case lexical items that are unlikely to be single-word proper names (e.g., Very, I or TV) and lower-case lexical items (e.g., and and van) that can be parts of proper names.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In addition, the authority file contains about 20,000 first names.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
Our choice of disambiguation resources makes Nominator fast and robust.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"The precision and recall of Nominator, operating without a database of pre-existing proper names, is in the 90's while the processing rate is over 40Mg of text per hour on a RISC/6000 machine.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
(See (Ravin and Wacholder 1996) for details.),"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
This efficient processing has been achieved at the cost of limiting the extent to which the program can 'understand' the text being analyzed and resolve potential ambiguity.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"Many wordsequences that are easily recognized by human readers as names are ambiguous for Nominator, given the restricted set of tools available to it.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In cases where Nominator cannot resolve an ambiguity with relatively high confidence, we follow the principle that 'noisy information' is to be preferred to data omitted, so that no information is lost.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In ambiguous cases, the module is designed to make conservative decisions, such as including non-names or non-name parts in otherwise valid name sequences.","{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
It assigns weak types such as ?HUMAN or fails to assign a type if the available information is not sufficient.,"{'title': '3 Disambiguation Resources', 'number': '3'}"
"In this section, we give an overview of the process by which Nominator identifies and classifies proper names.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"

"Finally, Nominator groups together name vanants that refer to the same entity.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
"After information about names and their referents has been extracted from individual documents, an aggregation process combines the names collected from all the documents into a dictionary, or database of names, representative of the document collection.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
"(For more details on the process, see (Ravin and Wacholder 1996)).","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"

"... Before the text is processed by Nominator, it is analyzed into tokens — sentences, words, tags, and punctuation elements.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
"Nominator forms a candidate name list by scanning the tokenized document and collecting sequences of capitalized tokens (or words) as well as some special lower-case tokens, such as conjunctions and prepositions.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
"The list of candidate names extracted from the sample document contains: Each candidate name is examined for the presence of conjunctions, prepositions or possessive 's.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
A set of heuristics is applied to determine whether each candidate name should be split into smaller independent names.,"{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
"For example, Mr. Jordan of Steptoe & Johnson is split into Mr. Jordan and Steptoe & Johnson.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"

"It may be one of the variants found in the document or it may be constructed from components of different ones As the links are formed, each group is assigned a type.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
"In the sample output shown below, each canonical name is followed by its entity type and by the variants linked to it.","{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"

In the following sections we describe how ambiguity is resolved as part of the name discovery process.,"{'title': '4 The Name Discovery Process', 'number': '4'}"
"We identify three indicators of potential structural ambiguity, prepositions, conjunctions and possessive pronouns, which we refer to as 'ambiguous operators'.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"In order to determine whether 'splitting' should occur, a name sequence containing an ambiguous operator is divided into three segments — the operator, the substring to its left and the substring to its right.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"The splitting process applies a set of heuristics based on patterns of capitalization, lexical features and the relative 'scope' of operators (see below) to name sequences containing these operators to determine whether or not they should be split into smaller names.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"We can describe the splitting heuristics as determining the scope of ambiguous operators, by analogy to the standard linguistic treatment of quantifiers.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"From Nominator's point of view, all three operator types behave in similar ways and often interact when they co-occur in the same name sequence, as in New York's MOMA and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"The scope of ambiguous operators also interacts with the 'scope' of NP-heads, if we define the scope of NP-heads as the constituents they dominate.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, in Victoria and Albert Museum, the conjunction is within the scope of the lexical head Museum because Museum is a noun that can take PP modification (Museum of Natural History) and hence pre-modification (Natural History Museum).","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Since pre-modifiers can contain conjunctions (Japanis within the scope of the noun, and so the name is not split.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Although the same relationship holds between the lexical head Laboratories and the conjunction and in IBM and Bell Laboratories, another heuristic takes precedence, one whose condition requires splitting a string if it contains an acronym immediately to the left or to the right of the ambiguous operator.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
It is not possible to determine relative scope strength for all the combinations of different operators.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Contradictory examples abound: Gates of Microsoft and Gerstner of IBMsuggests stronger scope of and over of, The Department of German Languages and Literature suggests the opposite.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Since it is usually the case that a right-hand operator has stronger scope over a left-hand one, we evaluate strings containing operators from right to left.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"To illustrate, New York's MOMA and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is first evaluated for splitting on in.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Since the left and right substrings do not satisfy any conditions, we proceed to the next operator on the left — and.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"

We have found this simple typographical heuristic to be powerful and surprisingly accurate.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
Ambiguous operators form recursive structures and so the splitting heuristics apply recursively to name sequences until no more splitting conditions hold.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
New York's MOMA is further split at 's because of a heuristic that checks for place names on the left of a possessive pronoun or a comma.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
Victoria and Albert Museum in London remains intact.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
Nominator's other heuristics resemble those discussed above in that they check for typographical patterns or for the presence of particular name types to the left or right of certain operators.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
Some heuristics weigh the relative scope strength in the substrings on either side of the operator.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"If the scope strength is similar, the string is split.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
We have observed that this type of heuristic works quite well.,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Thus, the string The Natural History Museum and The Board of Education is split at and because each of its substrings contains a strong-scope NP-head (as we define it) with modifiers within its scope.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
These two substrings are better balanced than the substrings of The Food and Drug Administration where the left substring does not contain a strong-scope NP-head while the right one does (Administration).,"{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Because of the principle that noisy data is preferable to loss of information, Nominator does not split names if relative strength cannot be determined.","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"As a result, there occur in Nominator's output certain 'names' such as American Television 6 Commu","{'title': '5 Resolution of Structural Ambiguity', 'number': '5'}"
"Special treatment is required for words in sentenceinitial position, which may be capitalized because they are part of a proper name or simply because they are sentence initial.","{'title': '6 Resolution of Ambiguity at', 'number': '6'}"
"While the heuristics for splitting names are linguistically motivated and rule-governed, the heuristics for handling sentence-initial names are based on patterns of word occurrence in the document.","{'title': '6 Resolution of Ambiguity at', 'number': '6'}"
"When all the names have been collected and split, names containing sentence-initial words are compared to other names on the list.","{'title': '6 Resolution of Ambiguity at', 'number': '6'}"
"If the sentence-initial candidate name also occurs as a non-sentence-initial name or as a substring of it, the candidate name is assumed to be valid and is retained.","{'title': '6 Resolution of Ambiguity at', 'number': '6'}"
"Otherwise, it is removed from the list.","{'title': '6 Resolution of Ambiguity at', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, if White occurs at sentence-initial position and also as a substring of another name (e.g., Mr. White) it is kept.","{'title': '6 Resolution of Ambiguity at', 'number': '6'}"
"If it is found only in sentence-initial position (e.g., White paint is ...), White is discarded.","{'title': '6 Resolution of Ambiguity at', 'number': '6'}"

"Thus, Washington is likely to co-occur with either President Washington or Washington, D.C., but not with both.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"Indeed, we have observed that if several unambiguous variants do co-occur, as in documents that mention both the owner of a company and the company named after the owner, the editors refrain from using a variant that is ambiguous with respect to both.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"To disambiguate highly ambiguous variants then, we link them to unambiguous ones occurring within the same document.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"Nominator cycles through the list of names, identifying 'anchors', or variant names that unambiguously refer to certain entity types.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"When an anchor is identified, the list of name candidates is scanned for ambiguous variants that could refer to the same entity.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
They are linked to the anchor.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
Our measure of ambiguity is very pragmatic.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
It is based on the confidence scores yielded by heuristics that analyze a name and determine the entity types it can refer to.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"If the heuristic for a certain entity type (a person, for example) results in a high condifence score (highly confident that this is a person name), we determine that the name unambiguously refers to this type.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"Otherwise, we choose the highest score obtained by the various heuristics.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"A few simple indicators can unambiguously determine the entity type of a name, such as Mr. for a person or Inc. for an organization.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"More commonly, however, several pieces of positive and negative evidence are accumulated in order to make this judgement.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
We have defined a set of obligatory and optional components for each entity type.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"For a human name, these components include a professional title (e.g., Attorney General), a personal title (e.g., Dr.), a first name, middle name, nickname, last name, and suffix (e.g., Jr.).","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
The combination of the various components is inspected.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
Some combinations may result in a high negative score — highly confident that this cannot be a person name.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"For example, if the name lacks a personal title and a first name, and its last name is listed as an organization word (e.g., Department) in the authority list, it receives a high negative score.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
This is the case with Justice Department or Frank Sinatra Building.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"The same combination but with a last name that is not a listed organization word results in a low positive score, as for Justice Johnson or Frank Sinatra.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"The presence or absence of a personal title is also important for determining confidence: If present, the result is a high confidence score (e.g., Mrs. Ruth Lake); No personal title with a known first name results in a low positive confidence score (e.g., Ruth Lake, Beverly Hills); and no personal title with an unknown first name results in a zero score (e.g., Panorama Lake).","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"By the end of the analysis process, Justice Department has a high negative score for person and a low positive score for organization, resulting in its classification as an organization.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"Beverly Hills, by contrast, has low positive scores both for place and for person.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
Names with low or zero scores are first tested as possible variants of names with high positive scores.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"However, if they are incompatible with any, they are assigned a weak entity type.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"Thus in the absence of any other evidence in the document, Beverly Hills is classified as a ?PERSON.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
(?PERSON is preferred over ?PLACE as it tends to be the correct choice most of the time.),"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
This analysis of course can be over-ridden by a name database listing Beverly Hills as a place.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
Further disambiguation may be possible during aggregation across documents.,"{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"As mentioned before, during aggregation, linked groups from different documents are merged if their canonical forms are identical.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"As a rule, their entity types should be identical as well, to prevent a merge of Boston (PLACE) and Boston (ORG).","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"Weak entity types, however, are allowed to merge with stronger entity types.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"Thus, Jordan Hills (?PERSON) from one document is aggregated with Jordan Hills (PERSON) from another, where there was sufficient evidence, such as Mr. Hills, to make a firmer decision.","{'title': '7 Resolution of Semantic Ambiguity', 'number': '7'}"
"An evaluation of an earlier version of Nominator, was performed on 88 Wall Street Journal documents (NIST 1993) that had been set aside for testing.","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
"We chose the Wall Street Journal corpus because it follows standard stylistic conventions, especially capitalization, which is essential for Nominator to work.","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
Nominator's performance deteriorates if other conventions are not consistently followed.,"{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
"A linguist manually identified 2426 occurrences of proper names, which reduced to 1354 unique tokens.","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
"Of these, Nominator correctly identified the boundaries of 91% (1230/1354).","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
The precision rate was 92% for the 1409 names Nominator identified (1230/1409).,"{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
"In terms of semantic disambiguation, Nominator failed to assign an entity type to 21% of the names it identified.","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
This high percentage is due to a decision not to assign a type if the confidence measure is too low.,"{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
The payoff of this choice is a very high precision rate — 99 % — for the assignment of semantic type to those names that were disambiguated.,"{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
(See (Ravin and Wacholder 1996) for details.,"{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
The main reason that names remain untyped is insufficent evidence in the document.,"{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
"If IBM, for example, occurs in a document without International Business Machines, Nominator does not type it; rather, it lets later processes inspect the local context for further clues.","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
These processess form part of the Talent tool set under development at the T.J. Watson Research Center.,"{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
"They take as their input text processed by Nominator and further disambiguate untyped names appearing in certain contexts, such as an appositive, e.g., president of CitiBank Corp. Other untyped names, such as Star Bellied Sneetches or George Melloan's Business World, are neither people, places, organizations nor any of the other legal or financial entities we categorize into.","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
"Many of these uncategorized names are titles of articles, books and other works of art that we currently do not handle.","{'title': '8 Evaluation', 'number': '8'}"
Ambiguity remains one of the main challenges in the processing of natural language text.,"{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"Efforts to resolve it have traditionally focussed on the development of full-coverage parsers, extensive lexicons, and vast repositories of world knowledge.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"For some natural-language applications, the tremendous effort involved in developing these tools is still required, but in other applications, such as information extraction, there has been a recent trend towards favoring minimal parsing and shallow knowledge (Cowie and Lehnert 1996).","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"In its minimal use of resources, Nominator follows this trend: it relies on no syntactic information and on a small semantic lexicon — an authority list which could easily be modified to include information about new domains.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"Other advantages of using limited resources are robustness and execution speed, which are important in processing large amounts of text.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"In another sense, however, development of a module like Nominator still requires considerable human effort to discover reliable heuristics, particularly when only minimal information is used.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
These heuristics are somewhat domain dependent: different generalizations hold for names of drugs and chemicals than those identified for names of people or organizations.,"{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"In addition, as the heuristics depend on linguistic conventions, they are language dependent, and need updating when stylistic conventions change.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"Note, for example, the recent popularity of software names which include exclamation points as part of the name.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
"Because of these difficulties, we believe that for the forseeable future, practical applications to discover new names in text will continue to require the sort of human effort invested in Nominator.","{'title': '9 Conclusion', 'number': '9'}"
