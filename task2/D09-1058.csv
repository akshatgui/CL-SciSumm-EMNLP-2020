We conduct experiments on dependency parsing of English (on Penn Treebank data) and Czech (on the Prague Dependency Treebank).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our experiments investigate the effectiveness of: 1) the basic SS-SCM for dependency parsing; 2) a combination of the SS-SCM with Koo et al.

"These models make direct use of the feature-vector definition f(x, y) used in the original, fully supervised, dependency parser.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The first step is to partition the d features in f(x, y) into k separate feature vectors, r1(x, y) ... rk(x, y) (with the result that f is the concatenation of the k feature vectors r1 ... rk).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In our experiments on dependency parsing, we partitioned f into up to over 140 separate feature vectors corresponding to different feature types.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

The learning algorithm proceeds in three steps: Step 1: Estimation of a Fully Supervised Model.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We choose the initial value q0 of the generative models to be the uniform distribution, i.e., we set θj,a = 1/dj for all j, a.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Koo et al. (2008) describe a semi-supervised approach that incorporates cluster-based features, and that gives competitive results on dependency parsing benchmarks.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"

"First, hierarchical word clusters are derived from unlabeled data using the Brown et al. clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992).","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"
"Second, a new feature set is constructed by representing words by bit-strings of various lengths, corresponding to clusters at different levels of the hierarchy.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"

"Previous work (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007) has shown that second-order parsing models, which include information from “sibling” or “grandparent” relationships between dependencies, can give significant improvements in accuracy over first-order parsing models.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"
In principle it would be straightforward to extend the SS-SCM approach that we have described to second-order parsing models.,"{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"

"Second-order parsing models generally require more costly inference methods for the calculation of marginals, and this increased cost may be prohibitive when large quantities of unlabeled data are employed.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"

"More precisely, in our approach, we first train a first-order parsing model by Step 1 and 2, exactly as described in Section 2.4, to estimate w0, v0 and q1.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"
"Then, we substitute Step 3 as a supervised learning such as MIRA with a second-order parsing model (McDonald et al., 2005a), which incorporates q1 as a real-values features.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"
We refer this two-stage approach to as two-stage SS-SCM.,"{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"

"In particular, we perform the following optimizations on each update t = 1, ..., T for re-estimating w and v: where L(yi, y) represents the loss between correct output of i’th sample yi and y.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"
"Then, the scoring function S for each y can be defined as follows: where B represents a tunable scaling factor, and f1 and f2 represent the feature vectors of first and second-order parsing parts, respectively.","{'title': '3 Extensions', 'number': '2'}"

"In our implementation, on the 43M token BLLIP corpus, using baseline features, it takes about 5 hours to compute the expected counts required to estimate the parameters of the generative models on a single 2.93GHz Xeon processor.","{'title': '5 Results and Discussion', 'number': '4'}"
It takes roughly 18 days of computation to estimate the generative models from the larger (3.72 billion word) corpus.,"{'title': '5 Results and Discussion', 'number': '4'}"
Fortunately it is simple to parallelize this step; our method takes a few hours on the larger data set when parallelized across around 300 separate processes.,"{'title': '5 Results and Discussion', 'number': '4'}"
"Note that once the generative models have been estimated, decoding with the model, or training the model on labeled data, is relatively inexpensive, essentially taking the same amount of computation as standard dependency-parsing approaches.","{'title': '5 Results and Discussion', 'number': '4'}"

We have described experiments that show that the approach gives significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for dependency parsing; performance improves when the amount of unlabeled data is increased from 43.8 million tokens to 3.72 billion tokens.,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
The approach should be relatively easily applied to languages other than English or Czech.,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
"We stress that the SS-SCM approach requires relatively little hand-engineering: it makes direct use of the existing feature-vector representation f(x, y) used in a discriminative model, and does not require the design of new features.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
"The main choice in the approach is the partitioning of f(x, y) into components r1(x, y) ... rk(x, y), which in our experience is straightforward.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '6'}"
