We present a new method for detecting anddisambiguating named entities in open do main text.,{}
A disambiguation SVM kernel is trained to exploit the high coverage and rich structure of the knowledge encoded in an online encyclopedia.,{}
The resultingmodel significantly outperforms a less in formed baseline.,{}
1.1 Motivation.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The de-facto web search paradigm defines the re sult to a user?s query as roughly a set of links to the best-matching documents selected out of billions of items available.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Whenever the queries search for pinpointed, factual information, the burden of filling the gap between the output granularity (whole documents) and the targeted information (a set of sentences or relevant phrases) stays with theusers, by browsing the returned documents in or der to find the actually relevant bits of information.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A frequent case are queries about named entities,which constitute a significant fraction of popu lar web queries according to search engine logs.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"When submitting queries such as John Williamsor Python, search engine users could also be presented with a compilation of facts and specific at tributes about those named entities, rather than aset of best-matching web pages.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"One of the chal lenges in creating such an alternative search result page is the inherent ambiguity of the queries, as several instances of the same class (e.g., different people) or different classes (e.g., a type of snake, a programming language, or a movie) may share the same name in the query.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As an example, the Work done during a summer internship at Google.contexts below are part of web documents refer ring to different people who share the same name John Williams:1.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
?John Williams and the Boston Pops conducted a summer Star Wars concert at Tan glewood.?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
2.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"?John Williams lost a Taipei death match against his brother, Axl Rotten.?","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
3.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
?John Williams won a Victoria Cross for his actions at the battle of Rorke?s Drift.?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The effectiveness of the search could be greatly improved if the search results were grouped together according to the corresponding sense, rather than presented as a flat, sense-mixed list of items (whether links to full-length documents, or extracted facts).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As an added benefit, userswould have easier access to a wider variety of re sults, whenever the top 10 or so results returned by the largest search engines happen to refer to only one particular (arguably the most popular) sense of the query (e.g., the programming language in the case of Python), thus submerging or ?hiding?","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"documents that refer to other senses of the query.In various natural language applications, significant performance gains are achieved as a function of data size rather than algorithm complex ity, as illustrated by the increasingly popular use of the web as a (very large) corpus (Dale, 2003).","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It seems therefore natural to try to exploit the webin order to also improve the performance of relation extraction, i.e. the discovery of useful re lationships between named entities mentioned in text documents.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, if one wants to combine evidence from multiple web pages, then one needs again to solve the name disambiguation problem.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"9Without solving it, a relation extraction system an alyzing the sentences in the above example could mistakenly consider the third as evidence that John Williams the composer fought at Rorke?s Drift.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
1.2 Approach.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The main goal of the research reported in this pa per is to develop a named entity disambiguation method that is intrinsically linked to a dictionarymapping proper names to their possible named en titiy denotations.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"More exactly, the method: 1.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

ties that can be denoted by the same proper name (disambiguation).,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"As a departure from the methodology of previous approaches, the paper exploits a non-traditionalweb-based resource.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Concretely, it takes advan tage of some of the human knowledge available in Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia createdthrough decentralized, collective efforts of thou sands of users (Remy, 2002).","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
We show that the structure of Wikipedia lends itself to a set ofuseful features for the detection and disambiguation of named entities.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
The remainder of the pa per is organized as follows.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Section 2 describes Wikipedia, with an emphasis on the features that are most important to the entity disambiguation task.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
Section 3 describes the extraction of named entity entries (versus other types of entries) fromWikipedia.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Section 4 introduces two disambigua tion methods, which are evaluated experimentally in Section 5.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
We conclude with future work and conclusions.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
2 Wikipedia ? A Wiki Encyclopedia.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia writtencollaboratively by volunteers, using a wiki soft ware that allows almost anyone to add and change articles.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
It is a multilingual resource - there are about 200 language editions with varying levels of coverage.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
Wikipedia is a very dynamic andquickly growing resource ? articles about news worthy events are often added within days of their occurrence.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"As an example, the September 2005 version contains 751,666 articles, around 180,000 more articles than four months earlier.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The work in this paper is based on the English version from May 2005, which contains 577,860 articles.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Each article in Wikipedia is uniquely identified by its title ? a sequence of words separated byunderscores, with the first word always capital ized.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Typically, the title is the most common name for the entity described in the article.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"When the name is ambiguous, it is further qualified with aparenthetical expression.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For instance, the arti cle on John Williams the composer has the title John Williams (composer).Because each article describes a specific entity or concept, the remainder of the paper sometimes uses the term ?entity?","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"

"Also, let E denote the entire set of entities from Wikipedia.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For any entity e2E, e:title is the title name of the corresponding article, and e:T is the text of the article.In general, there is a many-to-many correspon dence between names and entities.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"This relationis captured in Wikipedia through redirect and dis ambiguation pages, as described in the next two sections.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
2.1 Redirect Pages.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
A redirect page exists for each alternative name that can be used to refer to an entity in Wikipedia.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
The name is transformed (using underscores for spaces) into a title whose article contains aredirect link to the actual article for that en tity.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, John Towner Williams is the full name of the composer John Williams.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Itis therefore an alternative name for the composer, and consequently the article with the ti tle John Towner Williams is just a pointer to thearticle for John Williams (composer).","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
An exam ple entry with a considerably higher number of redirect pages is United States.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Its redirect pages correspond to acronyms (U.S.A., U.S., USA, US),Spanish translations (Los Estados Unidos, Estados Unidos), misspellings (Untied States) or syn onyms (Yankee land).","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For any given Wikipedia entity e2E, let e:R be the set of all names that redirect to e. 2.2 Disambiguation Pages.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Another useful structure is that of disambiguation pages, which are created for ambiguous names, i.e. names that denote two or more entities in Wikipedia.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"

"Table 1: Examples of Wikipedia titles, aliases and categories entities.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Therefore, besides the non-ambiguous names that come from redirect pages, additionalaliases can be found by looking for all disambiguation pages that list a particular Wikipedia en tity.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
In his philosophical article ?On Sense and Reference?,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"

"This theoretical example is nicelycaptured in practice in Wikipedia by two disam biguation pages, Morning Star and Evening Star, both listing Venus as a potential referent.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"For any given Wikipedia entity e 2 E, let e:D be the set of names whose disambiguation pages contain a link to e. 2.3 Categories.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
Every article in Wikipedia is required to have at least one category.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"As shown in Table 1, John Williams (composer) is associated with a set of categories, among them Star Wars music, Filmscore composers, and 20th century classical com posers.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
Categories allow articles to be placed into one or more topics.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
These topics can be further categorized by associating them with one or more parent categories.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
In Table 1 Venus is shown asboth an article title and a category.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"As a cate gory, it has one direct parent Planets of the SolarSystem, which in turn belongs to two more gen eral categories, Planets and Solar System.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, categories form a directed acyclic graph, allowingmultiple categorization schemes to co-exist simul taneously.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"There are in total 59,759 categories in Wikipedia.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"

2.4 Hyperlinks.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
Articles in Wikipedia often contain mentions ofentities that already have a corresponding article.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"When contributing authors mention an ex isting Wikipedia entity inside an article, they arerequired to link at least its first mention to the cor responding article, by using links or piped links.Both types of links are exemplified in the follow ing wiki source code of a sentence from the article on Italy: ?The [[Vatican City|Vatican]] is now an independent enclave surrounded by [[Rome]]?.","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-.

The string from the second link (?Rome?),"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"

The same string is also used in the display version.,"{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
"If the authorwants another string displayed (e.g., ?Vatican?","{'title': 'Disambiguates between multiple named enti-. ', 'number': '2'}"
