"This paper proposes a new indicator of text structure, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a text.",{}
A text segment is a coherent scene; the words in a segment are linked together via lexical cohesion relations.,{}
LCP records mutual similarity of words in a sequence of text.,{}
"The similarity of words, which represents their cohesiveness, is computed using a semantic network.",{}
Comparison with the text segments marked by a number of subjects shows that LCP closely correlates with the human judgments.,{}
LCP may provide valuable information for resolving anaphora and ellipsis.,{}

One of the constituents of the text structure is a text segment.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"A text segment, whether or not it is explicitly marked, as are sentences and paragraphs, is defined as a sequence of clauses or sentences that display local coherence.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"It resembles a scene in a movie, which describes the same objects in the same situation.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"This paper proposes an indicator, called the lexical cohesion profile (LCP), which locates segment boundaries in a narrative text.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
LCP is a record of lexical cohesiveness of words in a sequence of text.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
"Lexical cohesiveness is defined as word similarity (Kozima and Furugori, 1993) computed by spreading activation on a semantic network.","{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
Hills and valleys of LCP closely correlate with changing of segments.,"{'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'number': '1'}"
Several methods to capture segment boundaries have been proposed in the studies of text structure.,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, cue phrases play an important role in signaling segment changes.","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"(Grosz and Sidner, 1986) However, such clues are not directly based on coherence which forms the clauses or sentences into a segment.","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
Youmans (1991) proposed VMP (vocabulary management profile) as an indicator of segment boundaries.,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
VMP is a record of the number of new vocabulary terms introduced in an interval of text.,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"However, VMP does not work well on a high-density text.","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
The reason is that coherence of a segment should be determined not only by reiteration of words but also by lexical cohesion.,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
Morris and Hirst (1991) used Roget's thesaurus to determine whether or not two words have lexical cohesion.,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"Their method can capture almost all the types of lexical cohesion, e.g. systematic and non-systematic semantic relation.","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
However it does not deal with strength of cohesiveness which suggests the degree of contribution to coherence of the segment.,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"Kozima and Furugori (1993) defined lexical cohesiveness as semantic similarity between words, and proposed a method for measuring it.","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
Similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on a semantic network which is systematically constructed from an English dictionary (LDOCE).,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"The similarity (TOD, w') E [0,1] between words to, w' is computed in the following way: (1) produce an activated pattern by activating the node w; (2) observe activity of the node w1 in the activated pattern.","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"The following examples suggest the feature of the similarity cr: pet) = 0.133722 , hat) = 0.001784 , restaurant) = 0.175699 , restaurant) = 0.006260 .","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"The similarity a- depends on the significance s(w) E [0, 1], i.e. normalized information of the word w in West's corpus (1953).","{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
For example: The following examples show the relationship between the word significance and the similarity:,"{'title': 'SEGMENTS AND COHERENCE', 'number': '2'}"
"LCP of the text T = {w1,• • •, wN} is a sequence {c(Si),• • •, c(SN)} of lexical cohesiveness c(Si).","{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
Si is the word list which can be seen through a fixedwidth window centered on the i-th word of T: LCP treats the text T as a word list without any punctuation or paragraph boundaries.,"{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
"Lexical cohesiveness c(Si) of the word list Si is defined as follows: where a(P(Si), tv) is the activity value of the node w in the activated pattern P(S).","{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
P(Si) is produced by activating each node w E Si with strength s(w)2/ s(w).,"{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
"Figure 1 shows a sample pattern of {red, alcoholic, drink).","{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
(Note that it has highly activated nodes like bottle and wine.),"{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
"The definition of c(Si) above expresses that c(Si) represents semantic homogeneity of Si, since P(Si) represents the average meaning of w E Si.","{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
For example: c(&quot;Molly saw a cat.,"{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
It was her family pet.,"{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
"She wished to keep a lion.&quot; = 0.403239 (cohesive), c(&quot;There is no one but me.","{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
Put on your clothes.,"{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
I can not walk more.&quot; = 0.235462 (not cohesive).,"{'title': 'LEXICAL COHESION PROFILE', 'number': '3'}"
"A graph of LCP, which plots c(Si) at the text position i, indicates changing of segments: As shown in Figure 2, the segment boundaries can be detected by the valleys (minimum points) of LCP.","{'title': 'LCP and Its Feature', 'number': '4'}"
"The LCP, shown in Figure 3, has large hills and valleys, and also meaningless noise.","{'title': 'LCP and Its Feature', 'number': '4'}"
The graph is so complicated that one can not easily determine which valley should be considered as a segment boundary.,"{'title': 'LCP and Its Feature', 'number': '4'}"
"The shape of the window, which defines weight of words in it for pattern production, makes LCP smooth.","{'title': 'LCP and Its Feature', 'number': '4'}"
"Experiments on several window shapes (e.g. triangle window, etc.) shows that Harming window is best for clarifying the macroscopic features of LCP.","{'title': 'LCP and Its Feature', 'number': '4'}"
"The width of the window also has effect on the macroscopic features of LCP, especially on separability of segments.","{'title': 'LCP and Its Feature', 'number': '4'}"
Experiments on several window widths (A =5 — 60) reveals that the Hanning window of A =25 gives the best correlation between LCP and segments.,"{'title': 'LCP and Its Feature', 'number': '4'}"
This section inspects the correlation between LCP and segment boundaries perceived by the human judgments.,"{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
"The curve of Figure 4 shows the LCP of the simplified version of 0.Henry's &quot;Springtime a la Carte&quot; (Thornley, 1960).","{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
The solid bars represent the histogram of segment boundaries reported by 16 subjects who read the text without paragraph structure.,"{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
It is clear that the valleys of the LCP correspond mostly to the dominant segment boundaries.,"{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, the clear valley at i = 110 exactly corresponds to the dominant segment boundary (and also to the paragraph boundary shown as a dotted line).","{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
Note that LCP can detect segment changing of a text regardless of its paragraph structure.,"{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, i = 156 is a paragraph boundary, but neither a valley of the LCP nor a segment boundary; i = 236 is both a segment boundary and approximately a valley of the LCP, but not a paragraph boundary.","{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
"However, some valleys of the LCP do not exactly correspond to segment boundaries.","{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, the valley near i = 450 disagree with the segment boundary at i = 465.","{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
The reason is that lexical cohesion can not cover all aspect of coherence of a segment; all incoherent piece of text can be lexically cohesive.,"{'title': 'VERIFICATION OF LCP', 'number': '5'}"
"This paper proposed LCP, all indicator of segment changing, which concentrates on lexical cohesion of a text. segment.","{'title': 'CONCLUSION', 'number': '6'}"
"The experiment proved that LCP closely correlate with the segment boundaries captured by the human judgments, and that lexical cohesion plays main role in forming a sequence of words into segments.","{'title': 'CONCLUSION', 'number': '6'}"
Text segmentation described here provides basic information for text understanding: Segment boundaries provide valuable restriction for determination of the referents.,"{'title': 'CONCLUSION', 'number': '6'}"
Segment boundaries can be considered as segment switching (push and pop) in hierarchical structure of text.,"{'title': 'CONCLUSION', 'number': '6'}"
The segmentation can be applied also to text summarizing.,"{'title': 'CONCLUSION', 'number': '6'}"

"In future research, the author needs to examine validity of LCP for other genres — Hearst (1993) segments expository texts.","{'title': 'CONCLUSION', 'number': '6'}"
"Incorporating other clues (e.g. cue phrases, tense and aspect, etc.) is also needed to make this segmentation method more robust.","{'title': 'CONCLUSION', 'number': '6'}"
