"Past work (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Ibrahim et al., 2003) has examined the use of monolingual parallel corpora for paraphrase extraction.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Examples of monolingual parallel corpora that have been used are multiple translations of classical French novels into English, and data created for machine translation evaluation methods such as Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) which use multiple reference translations.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"While the results reported for these methods are impressive, their usefulness is limited by the scarcity of monolingual parallel corpora.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Small data sets mean a limited number of paraphrases can be extracted.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Furthermore, the narrow range of text genres available for monolingual parallel corpora limits the range of contexts in which the paraphrases can be used.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Instead of relying on scarce monolingual parallel data, our method utilizes the abundance of bilingual parallel data that is available.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This allows us to create a much larger inventory of phrases that is applicable to a wider range of texts.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Our method for identifying paraphrases is an extension of recent work in phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

"Much previous work on extracting paraphrases (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003) has focused on finding identifying contexts within aligned monolingual sentences from which divergent text can be extracted, and treated as paraphrases.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
Barzilay and McKeown (2001) gives the example shown in Figure 1 of how identical surrounding substrings can be used to extract the paraphrases of burst into tears as cried and comfort as console.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"While monolingual parallel corpora often have identical contexts that can be used for identifying paraphrases, bilingual parallel corpora do not.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"Instead, we use phrases in the other language as pivots: we look at what foreign language phrases the English translates to, find all occurrences of those foreign phrases, and then look back at what other English phrases they translate to.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
We treat the other English phrases as potential paraphrases.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
Figure 2 illustrates how a German phrase can be used as a point of identification for English paraphrases in this way.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
Section 2.1 explains which statistical machine translation techniques are used to align phrases within sentence pairs in a bilingual corpus.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"A significant difference between the present work and that employing monolingual parallel corpora, is that our method frequently extracts more than one possible paraphrase for each phrase.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
We assign a probability to each of the possible paraphrases.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"This is a mechanism for ranking paraphrases, which can be utilized when we come to select the correct paraphrase for a given context.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
Section 2.2 explains how we calculate the probability of a paraphrase.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
We use phrase alignments in a parallel corpus as pivots between English paraphrases.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
We find these alignments using recent phrase-based approaches to statistical machine translation.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"The original formulation of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) was defined as a word-based operation.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"The probability that a foreign sentence is the translation of an English sentence is calculated by summing over the probabilities of all possible word-level alignments, a, between the sentences: Thus Brown et al. decompose the problem of determining whether a sentence is a good translation of another into the problem of determining whether there is a sensible mapping between the words in the sentences.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
More recent approaches to statistical translation calculate the translation probability using larger blocks of aligned text.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"Koehn (2004), Tillmann (2003), and Vogel et al. (2003) describe various heuristics for extracting phrase alignments from the Viterbi word-level alignments that are estimated using Brown et al.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
(1993) models.,"{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"We use the heuristic for phrase alignment described in Och and Ney (2003) which aligns phrases by incrementally building longer phrases from words and phrases which have adjacent alignment points.1 zu haben what is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control im Ÿbrigen ist die diesbezŸgliche kostenentwicklung völlig unter kontrolle wir sind es den steuerzahlern schuldig die kosten unter kontrolle in check we owe it to the taxpayers to keep the costs We define a paraphrase probability p(e2|e1) in terms of the translation model probabilities p(f|e1), that the original English phrase e1 translates as a particular phrase f in the other language, and p(e2|f), that the candidate paraphrase e2 translates as the foreign language phrase.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"Since e1 can translate as multiple foreign language phrases, we sum over f: The translation model probabilities can be computed using any standard formulation from phrasebased machine translation.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, p(e|f) can be calculated straightforwardly using maximum likelihood estimation by counting how often the phrases e and f were aligned in the parallel corpus: Note that the paraphrase probability defined in Equation 2 returns the single best paraphrase, e2, irrespective of the context in which e1 appears.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"
"Since the best paraphrase may vary depending on information about the sentence that e1 appears in, we extend the paraphrase probability to include that sentence S: word-level alignments in this paper, direct estimation of phrasal translations (Marcu and Wong, 2002) would also suffice for extracting paraphrases from bilingual corpora. a million, as far as possible, at work, big business, carbon dioxide, central america, close to, concentrate on, crystal clear, do justice to, driving force, first half, for the first time, global warming, great care, green light, hard core, horn of africa, last resort, long ago, long run, military action, military force, moment of truth, new world, noise pollution, not to mention, nuclear power, on average, only too, other than, pick up, president clinton, public transport, quest for, red cross, red tape, socialist party, sooner or later, step up, task force, turn to, under control, vocational training, western sahara, world bank S allows us to re-rank the candidate paraphrases based on additional contextual information.","{'title': '2 Extracting paraphrases', 'number': '2'}"

"Ignoring the constraint that the new sentences remain grammatically correct, these paraphrases were judged to have the correct meaning 84.7% of the time.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"

"In order to allow the surrounding words in the sentence to have an influence on which paraphrase was selected, we re-ranked the paraphrase probabilities based on a trigram language model trained on the entire English portion of the Europarl corpus.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Paraphrases were selected from among all those in Table 2, and not constrained to the italicized phrases.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"In the case of the paraphrases extracted from the manual word alignments, the language model re-ranking had virtually no influence, and resulted in a slight dip in accuracy to 71.7% In this experimental condition paraphrases were extracted from a set of automatic alignments produced by running Giza++ over a set of 1,036,000 GermanEnglish sentence pairs (roughly 28,000,000 words in each language).","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
When the single best paraphrase (irrespective of context) was used in place of the original phrase in the evaluation sentence the accuracy reached 48.9% which is quite low compared to the 74.9% of the manually aligned set.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
As with the manual alignments it seems that we are selecting phrases which have the correct meaning but are not grammatical in context.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Indeed our judges thought the meaning of the paraphrases to be correct in 64.5% of cases.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Using a language model to select the best paraphrase given the context reduces the number of ungrammatical examples and gives an improvement in quality from 48.9% to 55.3% correct.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"These results suggest two things: that improving the quality of automatic alignments would lead to more accurate paraphrases, and that there is room for improvement in limiting the paraphrases by their context.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
We address these points below.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Work in statistical machine translation suggests that, like many other machine learning problems, performance increases as the amount of training data increases.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Och and Ney (2003) show that the accuracy of alignments produced by Giza++ improve as the size of the training corpus increases.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Since we used the whole of the German-English section of the Europarl corpus, we could not try improving the alignments by simply adding more German-English training data.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"However, there is nothing that limits our paraphrase extraction method to drawing on candidate paraphrases from a single target language.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"We therefore re-formulated the paraphrase probability to include multiple corpora, as follows: where C is a parallel corpus from a set of parallel corpora.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"For this condition we used Giza++ to align the French-English, Spanish-English, and ItalianEnglish portions of the Europarl corpus in addition to the German-English portion, for a total of around 4,000,000 sentence pairs in the training data.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The accuracy of paraphrases extracted over multiple corpora increased to 55%, and further to 57.4% when the language model re-ranking was included.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"As mentioned in Section 1, the way that we extract paraphrases is the converse of the methodology employed in word sense disambiguation work that uses parallel corpora (Diab and Resnik, 2002).","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
The assumption made in the word sense disambiguation work is that if a source language word aligns with different target language words then those words may represent different word senses.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
This can be observed in the paraphrases for at work in Table 2.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The paraphrases at the workplace, employment, and in the work sphere are a different sense of the phrase than operate, held, and holding, and they are aligned with different German phrases.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
When we calculate the paraphrase probability we sum over different target language phrases.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Therefore the English phrases that are aligned with the different German phrases (which themselves maybe indicative of different word senses) are mingled.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Performance may be degraded since paraphrases that reflect different senses of the original phrase, and which therefore have a different meaning, are included in the same candidate set.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
We therefore performed an experiment to see whether improvement could be had by limiting the candidate paraphrases to be the same sense as the original phrase in each test sentence.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"To do this, we used the fact that our test sentences were drawn from a parallel corpus.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
We limited phrases to the same word sense by constraining the candidate paraphrases to those that aligned with the same target language phrase.,"{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Our basic paraphrase calculation was therefore: Using the foreign language phrase to identify the word sense is obviously not applicable in monolingual settings, but acts as a convenient stand-in for a proper word sense disambiguation algorithm here.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"When word sense is controlled in this way, the accuracy of the paraphrases extracted from the automatic alignments raises dramatically from 48.9% to 57% without language model re-ranking, and further to 61.9% when language model re-ranking was included.","{'title': '4 Results', 'number': '4'}"

"Lin and Pantel (2001) use a standard (nonparallel) monolingual corpus to generate paraphrases, based on dependancy graphs and distributional similarity.","{'title': '5 Related Work', 'number': '5'}"
One strong disadvantage of this method is that their paraphrases can also have opposite meanings.,"{'title': '5 Related Work', 'number': '5'}"

"The shortcomings of this method are that it is dependent upon parse quality, and is limited by the rareness of the data.","{'title': '5 Related Work', 'number': '5'}"
