"Since all available dictionaries are incomplete, it is difficult to decide which set of English words to compare against.",Introduction
"Table 6 presents results for different choices of word coverage: the subset of existing pairs for English-Spanish, the union over all languages, and the intersection of all languages.",Introduction
Trends across subsets are relatively consistent.,Introduction
"As an illustration, Table 7 shows consensus formation on English-Norweigian and English-Portuguese translation mappings via multiple bridge languages.",Introduction
"Note that the English-French dictionary used here has no entry for &quot;bait&quot;, preventing its use as a bridge language for this word.",Introduction
"As can be seen in Table 6, the distance-based combination methods are more successful at combining the different proposals than the rank-N combinations.",Introduction
"One possible explanation for this is that rankbased classifiers pick the candidate with the best allaround distance, while distance-based combinations choose the single best candidate.",Introduction
Choosing the best all-around performer is detrimental when cognates exist for some languages but not for others.,Introduction

"The methods corresponding to &quot;oracle-1&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; are choosing from the same set of proposed targets, and the &quot;distance&quot; method achieves performance close to that of the oracle (77 vs. 82.8).",Introduction

There are three observations which can be made from the multipath results.,Introduction
1.,Introduction
Adding more pathways usually results in an accuracy improvement.,Introduction
When there is a drop in accuracy on the cognate vocabulary by adding an additional bridge language there tends to be an improvement in accuracy on the full vocabulary due to significantly more cognate pathways (yielding greater coverage).,Introduction
2.,Introduction
"It is difficult to substantially improve upon the performance of the single closest bridge language, especially when they are as close as enes-pt.",Introduction
Improvements on performance relative to the single best ranged from 2% to 20%.,Introduction
3.,Introduction
Several mediocre pathways can be combined to improve performance.,Introduction
"Though it is always better to find one high-performing pathway, it is often possible to get good performance from the combination of several, less well-performing pathways (e.g. en-[sr po]-uk vs. en-ru-uk).",Introduction
In Table 8 &quot;Cvg&quot; or cognate coverage is the percentage words in the source language for which any of the bridge languages contains a cognate to the target translation.,Introduction

Train on those pairs.,Experiment/Discussion
"For this set of experiments, Portuguese was chosen as the target language and Spanish, French, Italian and Romanian the source languages (Figure 2).",Experiment/Discussion
"The Spanish-Portuguese dictionary contained 1000 word pairs, while the others contained 900 pairs.",Experiment/Discussion
10(9)fold cross-validation experiments were performed in each case.,Experiment/Discussion
The number of training pairs for the adaptive methods which remained after filtering out unlikely cognate pairs ranged from 621 (for Spanish) to 232 (for Romanian).,Experiment/Discussion
"For the purpose of evaluation, we constrained the candidate test set to have exactly one translation per source word.",Experiment/Discussion
"However, this property was not used to improve candidate alignment (e.g. via the pigeonhole principle).",Experiment/Discussion
Table 1 shows results for different candidate distance functions for Spanish-Portuguese and FrenchPortuguese translation induction.,Experiment/Discussion
"The metrics depicted in the first three lines, namely Levenshtein distance (L), the HMM fenonic model (H), and the stochastic transducer (S), were previously described in Section 2.",Experiment/Discussion
The other three methods are variants of Levenshtein distance where the costs for edit operations have been modified.,Experiment/Discussion
"In L-V, the substitution operations between vowels are changed from 1 to 0.5.",Experiment/Discussion
"Two adaptively trained variants, L-S and L-A, are shown in the last two lines of Table 1.",Experiment/Discussion
"The weights in these two systems were produced by filtering the probabilities obtained from the stochastic transducer into three weight classes: 0.5, 0.75, and 1.",Experiment/Discussion
Identity substitutions were assigned a cost of zero.,Experiment/Discussion
"For L-S, the cost matrix was separately trained for each language pair, and for L-A, it was trained collectively over all the Romance languages.",Experiment/Discussion
Table 2 shows some of the highest probability consonant-to-consonant edit operations computed by the stochastic transducer (S).,Experiment/Discussion
"Most of these topranking derived transformations have been observed to be relatively low distance by either linguistic analysis of historical sound changes or by phonological classification, notably: nasal sonorants (&quot;n&quot; , unvoiced stops (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;f&quot;), and voiced stops (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;d&quot;).",Experiment/Discussion
"Other pairs are derivationally reasonable: (&quot;b&quot; , &quot;v&quot;), (&quot;x&quot; , &quot;s&quot;) and (&quot;s&quot; , &quot;c&quot;); while some may be noise: (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) and (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;v&quot;).",Experiment/Discussion
Not shown are vowel-to-vowel substitutions which in general were the most highly ranked; also not shown are tight correspondences between accented and unaccented vowel variants which were also learned by the stochastic transducer.,Experiment/Discussion
"As can be observed from Table 1, pure Levenshtein distance (L) works surprisingly well.",Experiment/Discussion
Dynamic adaptation via the stochastic transducers (S) also gives a notable boost on French-Portuguese (increasing cognate accuracy from 66% to 79%) but offer little improvement for Spanish-Portuguese (perhaps because pure Levenshtein needs no diffusion for relatively close languages while more complex mappings benefit from training).,Experiment/Discussion
"Similarly, a slight improvment is observed for Romanian-Portuguese under S, but no improvement for Italian-Portuguese.",Experiment/Discussion
"Also, empirical evidence suggests that the best method is achieved through learning weights with stochastic transducers and then using these weights in the L-S framework. for each word o E 0 for each bridge language B Translate o b E B Vt E T, Calculate D(b,t) Rank t by D(b,t) Score t using information from all bridges Select highest scored t Produce mapping o t Two scoring methods were investigated for the above algorithm: one based on rank and the other on distance.",Experiment/Discussion
"The rank-based scoring method takes each proposed target and combines the rank of that proposal across all classifiers, and chooses the translation with the lowest resulting rank (rank 1 is the best proposed translation).",Experiment/Discussion
"Since including all the hypothesized translations regardless of ranking performed poorly, we only include the ones with a ranking lower than some threshold N. The distance-based scoring method selects the hypothesized target word with the smallest distance from a translation in any of the bridge languages.",Experiment/Discussion
"We also tested one alternative dist-rank which uses ranks (as described above) to break ties in the distance-based method, with similar performance.",Experiment/Discussion
"In Table 6, we present the results obtained by applying different combination algorithms for the pathway from English to Portuguese using one of the other Romance languages (Spanish, Italian, French, and Romanian) as bridges and compare with the single best path (English-Spanish-Portuguese).",Experiment/Discussion
These results are presented for unrestricted matching on the full dictionary lexicon (1097 words in each language)2.,Experiment/Discussion
"This is a more difficult task than that used for direct induction (selecting between 100 and 900 potential translation candidates for each sourcelanguage word), so the system's performance is lower than the Section 3 results.",Experiment/Discussion
"Since all available dictionaries are incomplete, it is difficult to decide which set of English words to compare against.",Experiment/Discussion

Results for such oracles are also reported in Table 6.,Experiment/Discussion
"The methods corresponding to &quot;oracle-1&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; are choosing from the same set of proposed targets, and the &quot;distance&quot; method achieves performance close to that of the oracle (77 vs. 82.8).",Experiment/Discussion
"This section investigates the effect of different pathway configurations on the performance of the final multi-path system by examining the following situations: The results of these experiments are shown in Table 8.3 3Key: en=English, pt=Portuguese, fr=French, it=Italian, es=Spanish, ro=Romanian, du=Dutch, no=Norwegian, de=German, da=Danish, cz=Czech, uk=Ukrainian, po=Polish, sr=Serbian, ru=Russian The data sets used in these experiments were approximately the same size as those used in the previous experiment 1100-1300 translation word pairs.",Experiment/Discussion
