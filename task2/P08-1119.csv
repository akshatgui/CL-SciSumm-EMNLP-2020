A candidate is if it frequently leads to the discovery of other instances.,{}

"A variety of methods have been developed for automatic semantic class identification, under the rubrics of lexical acquisition, hyponym acquisition, semantic lexicon induction, semantic class learning, and web-based information extraction.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Many of these approaches employ surface-level patterns to identify words and their associated semantic classes.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, such patterns tend to overgenerate (i.e., deliver incorrect results) and hence require additional filtering mechanisms.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

This result led us to explore new ways to improve the accuracy of hyponym patterns without requiring additional training resources.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The main contribution of this work is a novel method for combining hyponym patterns with graph structures that capture two properties associated with pattern extraction: popularity and productivity.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Intuitively, a candidate word (or phrase) is popular if it was discovered many times by other words (or phrases) in a hyponym pattern.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
A candidate word is productive if it frequently leads to the discovery of other words.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Together, these two measures capture not only frequency of occurrence, but also crosschecking that the word occurs both near the class name and near other class members.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We present two algorithms that use hyponym pattern linkage graphs (HPLGs) to represent popularity and productivity information.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The first method uses a dynamically constructed HPLG to assess the popularity of each candidate and steer the bootstrapping process.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"This approach produces an efficient bootstrapping process that performs reasonably well, but it cannot take advantage of productivity information because of the dynamic nature of the process.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The second method is a two-step procedure that begins with an exhaustive pattern search that acquires popularity and productivity information about candidate instances.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The candidates are then ranked based on properties of the HPLG.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We conducted experiments with four semantic classes, achieving high accuracies and outperforming the results reported by others who have worked on the same classes.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"A substantial amount of research has been done in the area of semantic class learning, under a variety of different names and with a variety of different goals.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Given the great deal of similar work in information extraction and ontology learning, we focus here only on techniques for weakly supervised or unsupervised semantic class (i.e., supertype-based) learning, since that is most related to the work in this paper.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Fully unsupervised semantic clustering (e.g., (Lin, 1998; Lin and Pantel, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006)) has the disadvantage that it may or may not produce the types and granularities of semantic classes desired by a user.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Another related line of work is automated ontology construction, which aims to create lexical hierarchies based on semantic classes (e.g., (Caraballo, 1999; Cimiano and Volker, 2005; Mann, 2002)), and learning semantic relations such as meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2003).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Our research focuses on semantic lexicon induction, which aims to generate lists of words that belong to a given semantic class (e.g., lists of FISH or VEHICLE words).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Weakly supervised learning methods for semantic lexicon generation have utilized co-occurrence statistics (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998), syntactic information (Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Phillips and Riloff, 2002), lexico-syntactic contextual patterns (e.g., “resides in <location>” or “moved to <location>”) (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002), and local and global contexts (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"These methods have been evaluated only on fixed corpora1, although (Pantel et al., 2004) demonstrated how to scale up their algorithms for the web.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
Several techniques for semantic class induction have also been developed specifically for learning from the web.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"(Pas¸ca, 2004) uses Hearst’s patterns (Hearst, 1992) to learn semantic class instances and class groups by acquiring contexts around the pattern.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Pasca also developed a second technique (Pas¸ca, 2007b) that creates context vectors for a group of seed instances by searching web query logs, and uses them to learn similar instances.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"The work most closely related to ours is Hearst’s early work on hyponym learning (Hearst, 1992) and more recent work that has followed up on her idea.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Hearst’s system exploited patterns that explicitly identify a hyponym relation between a semantic class and a word (e.g., “such authors as Shakespeare”).","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
We will refer to these as hyponym patterns.,"{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Pasca’s previously mentioned system (Pas¸ca, 2004) applies hyponym patterns to the web and acquires contexts around them.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"The KnowItAll system (Etzioni et al., 2005) also uses hyponym patterns to extract class instances from the web and then evaluates them further by computing mutual information scores based on web queries.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"The work by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) on lexical acquisition is similar to ours because they also use graph structures to learn semantic classes.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"However, their graph is based entirely on syntactic relations between words, while our graph captures the ability of instances to find each other in a hyponym pattern based on web querying, without any part-ofspeech tagging or parsing.","{'title': '2 Related Work', 'number': '2'}"
"Our work was motivated by early research on hyponym learning (Hearst, 1992), which applied patterns to a corpus to associate words with semantic classes.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Hearst’s system exploited patterns that explicitly link a class name with a class member, such as “X and other Ys” and “Ys such as X”.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Relying on surface-level patterns, however, is risky because incorrect items are frequently extracted due to polysemy, idiomatic expressions, parsing errors, etc.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
Our work began with the simple idea of using an extremely specific pattern to extract semantic class members with high accuracy.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
Our expectation was that a very specific pattern would virtually eliminate the most common types of false hits that are caused by phenomena such as polysemy and idiomatic expressions.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"A concern, however, was that an extremely specific pattern would suffer from sparse data and not extract many new instances.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"By using the web as a corpus, we hoped that the pattern could extract at least a few instances for virtually any class, and then we could gain additional traction by bootstrapping these instances.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
All of the work presented in this paper uses just one doubly-anchored pattern to identify candidate instances for a semantic class: <class name> such as <class member> and * This pattern has two variables: the name of the semantic class to be learned (class name) and a member of the semantic class (class member).,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
The asterisk (*) indicates the location of the extracted words.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
We describe this pattern as being doubly-anchored because it is instantiated with both the name of the semantic class as well as a class member.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the pattern “CARS such as FORD and *” will extract automobiles, and the pattern “PRESIDENTS such as FORD and *” will extract presidents.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
The doubly-anchored nature of the pattern serves two purposes.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"First, it increases the likelihood of finding a true list construction for the class.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Our system does not use part-of-speech tagging or parsing, so the pattern itself is the only guide for finding an appropriate linguistic context.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Second, the doubly-anchored pattern virtually eliminates ambiguity because the class name and class member mutually disambiguate each other.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, the word FORD could refer to an automobile or a person, but in the pattern “CARS such as FORD and *” it will almost certainly refer to an automobile.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Similarly, the class “PRESIDENT” could refer to country presidents or corporate presidents, and “BUSH” could refer to a plant or a person.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"But in the pattern “PRESIDENTS such as BUSH”, both words will surely refer to country presidents.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
Another advantage of the doubly-anchored pattern is that an ambiguous or underspecified class name will be constrained by the presence of the class member.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, to generate a list of company presidents, someone might naively define the class name as PRESIDENTS.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"A singly-anchored pattern (e.g., “PRESIDENTS such as *”) might generate lists of other types of presidents (e.g., country presidents, university presidents, etc.).","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Because the doubly-anchored pattern also requires a class member (e.g., “PRESIDENTS such as BILL GATES and *”), it is likely to generate only the desired types of instances.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"To evaluate the performance of the doubly-anchored pattern, we began by using the pattern to search the web and embedded this process in a simple bootstrapping loop, which is presented in Figure 1.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"As input, the user must provide the name of the desired semantic class (Class) and a seed example (Seed), which are used to instantiate the pattern.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"On the first iteration, the pattern is given to Google as a web query, and new class members are extracted from the retrieved text snippets.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"We wanted the system to be as language-independent as possible, so we refrained from using any taggers or parsing tools.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"As a result, instances are extracted using only word boundaries and orthographic information.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"For proper name classes, we extract all capitalized words that immediately follow the pattern.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"For common noun classes, we extract just one word, if it is not capitalized.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Examples are shown below, with the extracted items underlined: countries such as China and Sri Lanka are ... fishes such as trout and bass can ... One limitation is that our system cannot learn multi-word instances of common noun categories, or proper names that include uncapitalized words (e.g., “United States of America”).","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
These limitations could be easily overcome by incorporating a noun phrase (NP) chunker and extracting NPs.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
Each new class member is then used as a seed instance in the bootstrapping loop.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"We implemented this process as breadth-first search, where each “ply” of the search process is the result of bootstrapping the class members learned during the previous iteration as seed instances for the next one.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"During each iteration, we issue a new web query and add the newly extracted class members to the queue for the next cycle.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"We run this bootstrapping process for a fixed number of iterations (search ply), or until no new class members are produced.","{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
We will refer to this process as reckless bootstrapping because there are no checks of any kind.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
Every term extracted by the pattern is assumed to be a class member.,"{'title': '3 Semantic Class Learning with Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graphs', 'number': '3'}"
"Table 1 shows the results for 4 iterations of reckless bootstrapping for four semantic categories: U.S. states, countries, singers, and fish.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The first two categories are relatively small, closed sets (our gold standard contains 50 U.S. states and 194 countries).","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The singers andfish categories are much larger, open sets (see Section 4 for details). quality deteriorates rapidly as bootstrapping progresses.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Figure 2 shows the recall and precision curves for countries and states.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
High precision is achieved only with low levels of recall for countries.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Our initial hypothesis was that such a specific pattern would be able to maintain high precision because non-class members would be unlikely to cooccur with the pattern.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"But we were surprised to find that many incorrect entries were generated for reasons such as broken expressions like “Merce -dez”, misidentified list constructions (e.g., “In countries such as China U.S. Policy is failing...”), and incomplete proper names due to insufficient length of the retrieved text snippet.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Incorporating a noun phrase chunker would eliminate some of these cases, but far from all of them.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
We concluded that even such a restrictive pattern is not sufficient for semantic class learning on its own.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"In the next section, we present a new approach that creates a Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graph to steer bootstrapping and improve accuracy.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Intuitively, we expect true class members to occur frequently in pattern contexts with other class members.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"To operationalize this intuition, we create a hyponym pattern linkage graph, which represents the frequencies with which candidate instances generate each other in the pattern contexts.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"We define a hyponym pattern linkage graph (HPLG) as a G = (V, E), where each vertex v ∈ V is a candidate instance and each edge (u, v) ∈ E means that instance v was generated by instance u.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The weight w of an edge is the frequency with which u generated v. For example, consider the following sentence, where the pattern is italicized and the extracted instance is underlined: Countries such as China and Laos have been...","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"In the HPLG, an edge e = (China, Laos) would be created because the pattern anchored by China extracted Laos as a new candidate instance.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"If this pattern extracted Laos from 15 different snippets, then the edge’s weight would be 15.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The in-degree of a node represents its popularity, i.e., the number of instance occurrences that generated it.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
The graph is constructed dynamically as bootstrapping progresses.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Initially, the seed is the only trusted class member and the only vertex in the graph.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The bootstrapping process begins by instantiating the doubly-anchored pattern with the seed class member, issuing a web query to generate new candidate instances, and adding these new instances to the graph.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"A score is then assigned to every node in the graph, using one of several different metrics defined below.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The highest-scoring unexplored node is then added to the set of trusted class members, and used as the seed for the next bootstrapping iteration.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
We experimented with three scoring functions for selecting nodes.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The In-Degree (inD) score for vertex v is the sum of the weights of all incoming edges (u, v), where u is a trusted class member.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"Intuitively, this captures the popularity of v among instances that have already been identified as good instances.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The Best Edge (BE) score for vertex v is the maximum edge weight among the incoming edges (u, v), where u is a trusted class member.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The Key Player Problem (KPP) measure is used in social network analysis (Borgatti and Everett, 2006) to identify nodes whose removal would result in a residual network of minimum cohesion.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
A node receives a high value if it is highly connected and relatively close to most other nodes in the graph.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"The KPP score for vertex v is computed as: where d(u, v) is the shortest path between two vertices, where u is a trusted node.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"For tie-breaking, the distances are multiplied by the weight of the edge.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Note that all of these measures rely only on incoming edges because a node does not acquire outgoing edges until it has already been selected as a trusted class member and used to acquire new instances.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"In the next section, we describe a two-step process for creating graphs that can take advantage of both incoming and outgoing edges.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
One way to try to confirm (or disconfirm) whether a candidate instance is a true class member is to see whether it can produce new candidate instances.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"If we instantiate our pattern with the candidate (i.e., “CLASS NAME such as CANDIDATE and *”) and successfully extract many new instances, then this is evidence that the candidate frequently occurs with the CLASS NAME in list constructions.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
We will refer to the ability of a candidate to generate new instances as its productivity.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
The previous bootstrapping algorithm uses a dynamically constructed graph that is constantly evolving as new nodes are selected and explored.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
Each node is scored based only on the set of instances that have been generated and identified as “trusted” at that point in the bootstrapping process.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"To use productivity information, we must adopt a different procedure because we need to know not only who generated each candidate, but also the complete set of instances that the candidate itself can generate.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
We adopted a two-step process that can use both popularity and productivity information in a hyponym pattern linkage graph to assess the quality of candidate instances.,"{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"
"First, we perform reckless bootstrapping for a class name and seed until no new instances are generated.","{'title': '3.2.1 Results', 'number': '4'}"

This example illustrates the power of the doubly-anchored hyponym pattern to correctly identify our intended semantic class by disambiguating our class name based on the seed class member.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
The algorithms also seem to be robust with respect to initial seed choice.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"For the states, countries, and singers categories, we ran experiments with 5 different initial seeds, which were randomly selected.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"The 5 country seeds represented a diverse set of nations, some of which are rarely mentioned in the news: Brazil, France, Guinea-Bissau, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
All of these seeds obtained > 92% recall with > 90% precision.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
We examined the incorrect instances produced by our algorithms and found that most of them fell into five categories.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
Type 1 errors were caused by incorrect proper name extraction.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, in the sentence “states such as Georgia and English speaking countries like Canada...”, “English” was extracted as a state.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"These errors resulted from complex noun phrases and conjunctions, as well as unusual syntactic constructions.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"An NP chunker might prevent some of these cases, but we suspect that many of them would have been misparsed regardless.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"Type 2 errors were caused by instances that formerly belonged to the semantic class (e.g., SerbiaMontenegro and Czechoslovakia are no longer countries).","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"In this error type, we also include borderline cases that could arguably belong to the semantic class (e.g., Wales as a country).","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"Type 3 errors were spelling variants (e.g., Kyrgystan vs. Kyrgyzhstan) and name variants (e.g., Beyonce vs. Beyonce Knowles).","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"Officially, every entity has one official spelling and one complete name, but in practice there are often variations that may occur nearly as frequently as the official name.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, it is most common to refer to the singer Beyonce by just her first name.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
Type 4 errors were caused by sentences that were just flat out wrong in their factual assertions.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
"For example, some sentences referred to “North America” as a country.","{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
Type 5 errors were caused by broken expressions found in the retrieved snippets (e.g.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
Michi -gan).,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
These errors may be fixable by cleaning up the web pages or applying heuristics to prevent or recognize partial words.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
It is worth noting that incorrect instances of Types 2 and 3 may not be problematic to encounter in a dictionary or ontology.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
Name variants and former class members may in fact be useful to have.,"{'title': '4 Experimental evaluation', 'number': '5'}"
Combining hyponym patterns with pattern linkage graphs is an effective way to produce a highly accurate semantic class learner that requires truly minimal supervision: just the class name and one class member as a seed.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
Our results consistently produced high accuracy and for the states and countries categories produced very high recall.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"The singers and fish categories, which are much larger open classes, also achieved high accuracy and generated many instances, but the resulting lists are far from complete.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Even on the web, the doublyanchored hyponym pattern eventually ran out of steam and could not produce more instances.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"However, all of our experiments were conducted using just a single hyponym pattern.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Other researchers have successfully used sets of hyponym patterns (e.g., (Hearst, 1992; Etzioni et al., 2005; Pas¸ca, 2004)), and multiple patterns could be used with our algorithms as well.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Incorporating additional hyponym patterns will almost certainly improve coverage, and could potentially improve the quality of the graphs as well.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
Our popularity-based algorithm was very effective and is practical to use.,"{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Our best-performing algorithm, however, was the 2-step process that begins with an exhaustive search (reckless bootstrapping) and then ranks the candidates using the Outdegree scoring function, which represents productivity.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"The first step is expensive, however, because it exhaustively applies the pattern to the web until no more extractions are found.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"In our evaluation, we ran this process on a single PC and it usually finished overnight, and we were able to learn a substantial number of new class instances.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"If more hyponym patterns are used, then this could get considerably more expensive, but the process could be easily parallelized to perform queries across a cluster of machines.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"With access to a cluster of ordinary PCs, this technique could be used to automatically create extremely large, high-quality semantic lexicons, for virtually any categories, without external training resources.","{'title': '5 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
