Our discourse module utilizes this pairwise perspective to define each Zi in terms of an intermediate “antecedent” variable Ai.,"{'title': '3 Generative Model', 'number': '3'}"

"2 Once the semantic module has generated entities and the discourse model selects entity assignments, each mention Mi generates word values for a set of observed properties Ri: Mention Generation For each mention Mi, i = 1, ... , n For each property r, there is a hyper-parameter αr which interpolates between selecting a word from the entity list Lr and drawing from the underlying type property distribution Br.","{'title': '3 Generative Model', 'number': '3'}"

"Since the person type in ACE conflates individual persons with groups of people (e.g., soldier vs. soldiers), we added the group (GROUP) type and generated a prototype specification.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"We obtained our prototype list by extracting at most four common proper and nominal head words from the newswire portions of the 2004 and 2005 ACE training sets (A04CU and A05ST); we chose prototype words to be minimally ambiguous with respect to type.8 When there are not at least three proper heads for a type (WEA for instance), we did not provide any proper prototypes and instead strongly biased the type fertility parameters to generate empty NAM-HEAD lists.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"

We test this component by presenting our learned model with boundary-annotated non-pronominal entities from the A05ST dev set and querying their predicted type variable T. Doing so yields 83.2 entity classification accuracy under the mapping between our prototyped types and the coarse ACE types.,"{'title': '6 Analysis', 'number': '7'}"
Note that this task is substantially more difficult than the unsupervised NER in Elsner et al. (2009) because the inventory of named entities is larger (7 vs. 3) and because we predict types over nominal mentions that are more difficult to judge from surface forms.,"{'title': '6 Analysis', 'number': '7'}"
"In this task, the plurality of errors are confusions between the GPE (geo-political entity) and ORG entity types, which have very similar distributions.","{'title': '6 Analysis', 'number': '7'}"
Our model is able to acquire and exploit knowledge at either the level of individual entities (“Obama” is a “president”) and entity types (“company” can refer to a corporation).,"{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '8'}"
"As a result, it leverages semantic constraints more effectively than systems operating at either level alone.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '8'}"
"In conjunction with reasonable, but simple, factors capturing discourse and syntactic configurational preferences, our entity-centric semantic model lowers coreference error rate substantially, particularly on semantically disambiguated references, giving a sizable improvement over the state-of-the-art.11 Acknowledgements: This project is funded in part by the Office of Naval Research under MURI Grant No.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '8'}"
