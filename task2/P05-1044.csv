"One way to make this explanation is to manipulate emission weights (i.e., for (tag, word) features): the learner can construct a good class-based unigram model of the text (where classes are tags).","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"This is good for the LENGTH objective, but not for learning good POS tag sequences.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"In contrast, DELORTRANS1 and TRANS1 do not allow the learner to manipulate emission weights for words not in the sentence.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The sentence’s goodness must be explained in a way other than by the words it contains: namely through the POS tags.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"To check this intuition, we built local normalized models p(word I tag) from the parameters learned by TRANS1 and LENGTH.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For each tag, these were compared by KL divergence to the empirical lexical distributions (from labeled data).","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"For the ten tags accounting for 95.6% of the data, LENGTH more closely matched the empirical lexical distributions.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"LENGTH is learning a correct distribution, but that distribution is not helpful for the task.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
The improvement from adding spelling features is striking: DELORTRANS1 and TRANS1 recover nearly completely (modulo the model selection problem) from the diluted dictionaries.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
LENGTH sees far less recovery.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
Hence even our improved feature sets cannot compensate for the choice of neighborhood.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
This highlights our argument that a neighborhood is not an approximation to log-linear EM; LENGTH tries very hard to approximate log-linear EM but requires a good dictionary to be on par with the other criteria.,"{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Good neighborhoods, rather, perform well in their own right.","{'title': '5 Experiments', 'number': '5'}"
"Foremost for future work is the “minimally supervised” paradigm in which a small amount of labeled data is available (see, e.g., Clark et al. (2003)).","{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"Unlike well-known “bootstrapping” approaches (Yarowsky, 1995), EM and CE have the possible advantage of maintaining posteriors over hidden labels (or structure) throughout learning; bootstrapping either chooses, for each example, a single label, or remains completely agnostic.","{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"One can envision a mixed objective function that tries to fit the labeled examples while discriminating unlabeled examples from their neighborhoods.8 Regardless of how much (if any) data are labeled, the question of good smoothing techniques requires more attention.","{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"Here we used a single zero-mean, constant-variance Gaussian prior for all parameters.","{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Better performance might be achieved by allowing different variances for different feature types.,"{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"This 8Zhu and Ghahramani (2002) explored the semi-supervised classification problem for spatially-distributed data, where some data are labeled, using a Boltzmann machine to model the dataset.","{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"

The effectiveness of CE (and different neighborhoods) for dependency grammar induction is explored in Smith and Eisner (2005) with considerable success.,"{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
We introduce there the notion of designing neighborhoods to guide learning for particular tasks.,"{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"Instead of guiding an unsupervised learner to match linguists’ annotations, the choice of neighborhood might be made to direct the learner toward hidden structure that is helpful for error-correction tasks like spelling correction and punctuation restoration that may benefit from a grammatical model.","{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
Wang et al. (2002) discuss the latent maximum entropy principle.,"{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
They advocate running EM many times and selecting the local maximum that maximizes entropy.,"{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"One might do the same for the local maxima of any CE objective, though theoretical and experimental support for this idea remain for future work.","{'title': '6 Future Work', 'number': '6'}"
"We have presented contrastive estimation, a new probabilistic estimation criterion that forces a model to explain why the given training data were better than bad data implied by the positive examples.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"We have shown that for unsupervised sequence modeling, this technique is efficient and drastically outperforms EM; for POS tagging, the gain in accuracy over EM is twice what we would get from ten times as much data and improved search, sticking with EM’s criterion (Smith and Eisner, 2004).","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
"On this task, with certain neighborhoods, contrastive estimation suffers less than EM does from diminished prior knowledge and is able to exploit new features—that EM can’t—to largely recover from the loss of knowledge.","{'title': '7 Conclusion', 'number': '7'}"
