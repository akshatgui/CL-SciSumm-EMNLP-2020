Fine-grained sense distinctions are one of the major obstacles to successful Word Sense Disambiguation.,{}
"In this paper, we present a method for reducing the granularity of the WordNet sense inventory based on the mapping to a manually crafted dictionary encoding sense hierarchies, namely the Oxford Dictionary of English.",{}
"We assess the quality of the mapping and the induced clustering, and evaluate the performance of coarse WSD systems in the Senseval-3 English all-words task.",{}
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is undoubtedly one of the hardest tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Even though some recent studies report benefits in the use of WSD in specific applications (e.g.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Vickrey et al. (2005) and Stokoe (2005)), the present performance of the best ranking WSD systems does not provide a sufficient degree of accuracy to enable real-world, language-aware applications.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Most of the disambiguation approaches adopt the WordNet dictionary (Fellbaum, 1998) as a sense inventory, thanks to its free availability, wide coverage, and existence of a number of standard test sets based on it.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Unfortunately, WordNet is a fine-grained resource, encoding sense distinctions that are often difficult to recognize even for human annotators (Edmonds and Kilgariff, 1998).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Recent estimations of the inter-annotator agreement when using the WordNet inventory report figures of 72.5% agreement in the preparation of the English all-words test set at Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) and 67.3% on the Open Mind Word Expert annotation exercise (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"These numbers lead us to believe that a credible upper bound for unrestricted fine-grained WSD is around 70%, a figure that state-of-the-art automatic systems find it difficult to outperform.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Furthermore, even if a system were able to exceed such an upper bound, it would be unclear how to interpret such a result.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It seems therefore that the major obstacle to effective WSD is the fine granularity of the WordNet sense inventory, rather than the performance of the best disambiguation systems.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Interestingly, Ng et al. (1999) show that, when a coarse-grained sense inventory is adopted, the increase in interannotator agreement is much higher than the reduction of the polysemy degree.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Following these observations, the main question that we tackle in this paper is: can we produce and evaluate coarse-grained sense distinctions and show that they help boost disambiguation on standard test sets?","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We believe that this is a crucial research topic in the field of WSD, that could potentially benefit several application areas.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The contribution of this paper is two-fold.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"First, we provide a wide-coverage method for clustering WordNet senses via a mapping to a coarse-grained sense inventory, namely the Oxford Dictionary of English (Soanes and Stevenson, 2003) (Section 2).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
We show that this method is well-founded and accurate with respect to manually-made clusterings (Section 3).,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Second, we evaluate the performance of WSD systems when using coarse-grained sense inventories (Section 4).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"We conclude the paper with an account of related work (Section 5), and some final remarks (Section 6).","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this section, we present an approach to the automatic construction of a coarse-grained sense inventory based on the mapping of WordNet senses to coarse senses in the Oxford Dictionary of English.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"In section 2.1, we introduce the two dictionaries, in Section 2.2 we illustrate the creation of sense descriptions from both resources, while in Section 2.3 we describe a lexical and a semantic method for mapping sense descriptions of WordNet senses to ODE coarse entries.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a computational lexicon of English which encodes concepts as synonym sets (synsets), according to psycholinguistic principles.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"For each word sense, WordNet provides a gloss (i.e. a textual definition) and a set of relations such as hypernymy (e.g. apple kind-of edible fruit), meronymy (e.g. computer has-part CPU), etc.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"The Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE) (Soanes and Stevenson, 2003)1 provides a hierarchical structure of senses, distinguishing between homonymy (i.e. completely distinct senses, like race as a competition and race as a taxonomic group) and polysemy (e.g. race as a channel and as a current).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
Each polysemous sense is further divided into a core sense and a set of subsenses.,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"For each sense (both core and subsenses), the ODE provides a textual definition, and possibly hypernyms and domain labels.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Excluding monosemous senses, the ODE has an average number of 2.56 senses per word compared to the average polysemy of 3.21 in WordNet on the same words (with peaks for verbs of 2.73 and 3.75 senses, respectively).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
In Table 1 we show an excerpt of the sense inventories of the noun race as provided by both dictionaries2.,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"The ODE identifies 3 homonyms and 3 polysemous senses for the first homonym, while WordNet encodes a flat list of 6 senses, some of which strongly related (e.g. race#1 and race#3).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Also, the ODE provides a sense (ginger root) which is not taken into account in WordNet.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"The structure of the ODE senses is clearly hierarchical: if we were able to map with a high accuracy WordNet senses to ODE entries, then a sense clustering could be trivially induced from the mapping.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"As a result, the granularity of the WordNet inventory would be drastically reduced.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Furthermore, disregarding errors, the clustering would be well-founded, as the ODE sense groupings were manually crafted by expert lexicographers.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"In the next section we illustrate a general way of constructing sense descriptions that we use for determining a complete, automatic mapping between the two dictionaries.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"For each word w, and for each sense S of w in a given dictionary D E {WORDNET, ODE}, we construct a sense description dD(S) as a bag of words: Specifically, in the case of WordNet, we generate def WN(S) from the gloss of S, hyperWN(S) from the noun and verb taxonomy, and domainsWN(S) from the subject field codes, i.e. domain labels produced semi-automatically by Magnini and Cavagli`a (2000) for each WordNet synset (we exclude the general-purpose label, called FACTOTUM).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, for the first WordNet sense of race#n we obtain the following description: In the case of the ODE, def ODE(S) is generated from the definitions of the core sense and the subsenses of the entry S. Hypernymy (for nouns only) and domain labels, when available, are included in the respective sets hyperODE(S) and domainsODE(S).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, the first ODE sense of race#n is described as follows: Notice that, for every S, dD(S) is non-empty as a definition is always provided by both dictionaries.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
This approach to sense descriptions is general enough to be applicable to any other dictionary with similar characteristics (e.g. the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English in place of ODE).,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to produce a coarse-grained version of the WordNet inventory, we aim at defining an automatic mapping between WordNet and ODE, i.e. a function µ : SensesWN → SensesODE U {E}, where SensesD is the set of senses in the dictionary D and E is a special element assigned when no plausible option is available for mapping (e.g. when the ODE encodes no entry corresponding to a WordNet sense).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Given a WordNet sense S E SensesWN(w) we define ˆm(S), the best matching sense in the ODE, as: where µ−1(S') is the group of WordNet senses mapped to the same sense S' of the ODE, while the second set includes singletons of WordNet 107 where B is a threshold below which a matching between sense descriptions is considered unreliable.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Finally, we define the clusteri In Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 we describe two different choices for the match function, respectively based on the use of lexical and seman where match : SensesWNxSensesODE → [0, 1] is a function that measures the degree of matching between the sense descriptions of S and S'.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
We define the mapping µ as: ng of senses c(w) of a word w as: senses for which no mapping can be provided according to the definition of µ.,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, an ideal mapping between entries in Table 1 would be as follows: resulting in the following clustering: As a first approach, we adopted a purely lexical matching function based on the notion of lexical overlap (Lesk, 1986).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"The function counts the number of lemmas that two sense descriptions of a word have in common (we neglect parts of speech), and is normalized by the minimum of the two descri Notice that unrelated senses can get a positive score because of an overlap of the sense descriptions.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"In the example, group#n, the hypernym of race#n#2, is also present in the definition of race#n#1.1.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Unfortunately, the very same concept can be defined with entirely different words.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"To match definitions in a semantic manner we adopted a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm, Structural Semantic Interconnections (SSI, Navigli and Velardi (2004)).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"SSI3 exploits an extensive lexical knowledge base, built upon the WordNet lexicon and enriched with collocation information representing semantic relatedness between sense pairs.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Collocations are acquired from existing resources (like the Oxford Collocations, the Longman Language Activator, collocation web sites, etc.).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Each collocation is mapped to the WordNet sense inventory in a semi-automatic manner and transformed into a relatedness edge (Navigli and Velardi, 2005).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Given a word context C = {w1, ..., wn}, SSI builds a graph G = (V, E) such that V = n at least one semantic interconnection between S and S' in the lexical knowledge base.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"A semantic interconnection pattern is a relevant sequence of edges selected according to a manually-created context-free grammar, i.e. a path connecting a pair of word senses, possibly including a number of intermediate concepts.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"The grammar consists of a small number of rules, inspired by the notion of lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"SSI performs disambiguation in an iterative fashion, by maintaining a set C of senses as a semantic context.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Initially, C = V (the entire set of senses of words in C).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"At each step, for each sense S in C, the algorithm calculates a score of the degree of connectivity between S and the other senses in C: where IC(S, S') is the set of interconnections between senses S and S'.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"The contribution of a single interconnection is given by the reciprocal of its length, calculated as the number of edges connecting its ends.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
The overall degree of connectivity is then normalized by the number of contributing interconnections.,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
The highest ranking sense S of word w is chosen and the senses of w are removed from the semantic context C. The algorithm terminates when either C = ∅ or there is no sense such that its score exceeds a fixed threshold.,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Given a word w, semantic matching is performed in two steps.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"First, for each dictionary D E {WORDNET, ODE}, and for each sense S E SensesD(w), the sense description of S is disambiguated by applying SSI to dD(S).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"As a result, we obtain a semantic description as a bag of concepts dsem D (S).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
Notice that sense descriptions from both dictionaries are disambiguated with respect to the WordNet sense inventory.,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Second, given a WordNet sense S E SensesWN(w) and an ODE sense S' E SensesODE(w), we define matchSSI(S, S') as a function of the direct relations connecting senses in dsem WN(S) and dsem where c → c' denotes the existence of a relation edge in the lexical knowledge base between a concept c in the description of S and a concept c' in the description of S'.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"Edges include the WordNet relation set (synonymy, hypernymy, meronymy, antonymy, similarity, nominalization, etc.) and the relatedness edge mentioned above (we adopt only direct relations to maintain a high precision).","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
"For example, some of the relations found between concepts in dsem contributing to the final value of the function on the two senses: Due to the normalization factor in the denominator, these values are generally low, but unrelated senses have values much closer to 0.","{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
We chose SSI for the semantic matching function as it has the best performance among untrained systems on unconstrained WSD (cf.,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"
Section 4.1).,"{'title': '2 Producing a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory', 'number': '2'}"

"We produced a gold-standard data set by manually mapping 5,077 WordNet senses of 763 randomlyselected words to the respective ODE entries (distributed as follows: 466 nouns, 231 verbs, 50 adjectives, 16 adverbs).","{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"
The data set was created by two annotators and included only polysemous words.,"{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"

All the differences between Lesk and SSI are statistically significant (p < 0.01).,"{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"
"As a second experiment, we used two information-theoretic measures, namely entropy and purity (Zhao and Karypis, 2004), to compare an automatic clustering c(w) (i.e. the sense groups acquired for word w) with a manual clustering ˆc(w).","{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"
"The entropy quantifies the distribution of the senses of a group over manually-defined groups, while the purity measures the extent to which a group contains senses primarily from one manual group.","{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"

"The overall purity of a clustering is obtained as a weighted sum of the individual cluster purities: We calculated the entropy and purity of the clustering produced automatically with the lexical and the semantic method, when compared to the grouping induced by our manual mapping (ODE), and to the grouping manually produced for the English all-words task at Senseval-2 (3,499 senses of 403 nouns).","{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"

Random clusterings were the result of a random mapping function between WordNet and ODE senses.,"{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"
"As expected, the automatic clusterings have a lower purity when compared to the Senseval-2 noun grouping as the granularity of the latter is much finer than ODE (entropy is only partially affected by this difference, indicating that we are producing larger groups).","{'title': '3 Evaluating the Clustering', 'number': '3'}"

A key feature in our approach is the use of a well-established dictionary encoding sense hierarchies.,"{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"As remarked in Section 2.2, the method can employ any dictionary with a sufficiently structured inventory of senses, and can thus be applied to reduce the granularity of, e.g., wordnets of other languages.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
One could argue that the adoption of the ODE as a sense inventory for WSD would be a better solution.,"{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"While we are not against this possibility, there are problems that cannot be solved at present: the ODE does not encode semantic relations and is not freely available.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Also, most of the present research and standard data sets focus on WordNet.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"The fine granularity of the WordNet sense inventory is unsuitable for most applications, thus constituting an obstacle that must be overcome.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"We believe that the research topic analyzed in this paper is a first step towards making WSD a feasible task and enabling language-aware applications, like information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, etc.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"In a future work, we plan to investigate the contribution of coarse disambiguation to such real-world applications.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"To this end, we aim to set up an Open Mind-like experiment for the validation of the entire mapping from WordNet to ODE, so that only a minimal error rate would affect the experiments to come.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
"Finally, the method presented here could be useful for lexicographers in the comparison of the quality of dictionaries, and in the detection of missing word senses.","{'title': '6 Conclusions', 'number': '6'}"
