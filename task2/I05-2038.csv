Linguistically annotated corpus based on texts in biomedical domain has been constructed to tune natural language processing (NLP) tools for bio textmining.,{}
"As the focus of information extraction is shifting from ""nominal"" information such as named entity to ""verbal"" information such as function and interaction of substances, applica tion of parsers has become one of the key technologies and thus the corpus annotated for syntactic structure of sen tences is in demand.",{}
A subset of the GENIA corpus consisting of 500 MEDLINE abstracts has been annotated for syntactic structure in an XML based format based on Penn Treebank II (PTB) scheme.,{}
"Inter-annotator agreement test indicated that the writ ing style rather than the contents of the research abstracts is the source of the difficulty in tree annotation, and that annotation can be stably done by linguists without much knowledge of bi ology with appropriate guidelines regarding to linguistic phenomena par ticular to scientific texts.",{}
Research and development for information extraction from biomedical literature (bio textmining) has been rapidly advancing due to demands caused by information overload in the genome-related field.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Natural language process ing (NLP) techniques have been regarded as useful for this purpose.,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Now that focus of in formation extraction is shifting from extraction of ?nominal?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
information such as named entity to ?verbal?,"{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"information such as relations of enti ties including events and functions, syntactic analysis is an important issue of NLP application in biomedical domain.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In extraction of rela tion, the roles of entities participating in the relation must be identified along with the verb that represents the relation itself.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In text analysis, this corresponds to identifying the subjects, ob jects, and other arguments of the verb.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Though rule-based relation information ex traction systems using surface pattern matching and/or shallow parsing can achieve high precision (e.g. Koike et al, 2004) in a particular target domain, they tend to suffer from low recall due to the wide variation of the surface ex pression that describe a relation between a verb and its arguments.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In addition, the portability of such systems is low because the system has to be re-equipped with different set of rules when different kind of relation is to be extracted.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"One solution to this problem is using deep parsers which can abstract the syntactic variation of a relation between a verb and its arguments repre sented in the text, and constructing extraction rule on the abstract predicate-argument structure.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"To do so, wide-coverage and high-precision parsers are required.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"While basic NLP techniques are relatively general and portable from domain to domain, customization and tuning are inevitable, especially in order to apply the techniques effec tively to highly specialized literatures such as research papers and abstracts.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As recent advances in NLP technology depend on machine learning techniques, annotated corpora from which system can acquire rules (including grammar rules, lexicon, etc.) are indispensable 220 resources for customizing general-purpose NLP tools.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In bio-textmining, for example, training on part-of-speech (POS)-annotated GENIA cor pus was reported to improve the accuracy of JunK tagger (English POS tagger) (Kazama et al., 2001) from 83.5% to 98.1% on MEDLINE abstracts (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and the FraMed corpus (Wermter and Hahn, 2004) was used to train TnT tagger on German (Brants, 2000) to improve its accuracy from 95.7% to 98% on clinical reports and other biomedical texts.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Corpus annotated for syntactic structures is expected to play a similar role in tuning parsers to biomedical domain, i.e., similar improve ment on the performance of parsers is expected by using domain-specific treebank as a resource for learning.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"For this purpose, we construct GENA Treebank (GTB), a treebank on research abstracts in biomedical domain.","{'title': 'Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The base text of GTB is that of the GENIA cor pus constructed at University of Tokyo (Kim et al., 2003), which is a collection of research ab stracts selected from the search results of MEDLINE database with keywords (MeSH terms) human, blood cells and transcription factors.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus.

"In the GENIA corpus, the abstracts are en coded in an XML scheme where each abstract is numbered with MEDLINE UID and contains title and abstract.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

"The GENIA corpus is also annotated for part-of speech (POS) (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and coreference is also annotated in a part of the GENIA corpus by MedCo project at Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore (Yang et al 2004).","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
GTB is the addition of syntactic information to the GENIA corpus.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"By annotating various linguistic information on a same set of text, the GENIA corpus will be a resource not only for individual purpose such as named entity extrac tion or training parsers but also for integrated systems such as information extraction using deep linguistic analysis.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus.

2.1 Annotation Scheme.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"The annotation scheme basically follows the Penn Treebank II (PTB) scheme (Beis et al 1995), encoded in XML.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"A non-null constituent is marked as an element, with its syntactic cate gory (which may be combined with its function tags indicating grammatical roles such as -SBJ, -PRD, and -ADV) used as tags.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
A null constitu ent is marked as a childless element whose tag corresponds to its categories.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
Other function tags are encoded as attributes.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Figure 1 shows an ex ample of annotated sentence in XML, and the corresponding PTB notation.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

"prepositional phrase, and ?VP?","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
verb phrase.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
The label ?NP-SBJ?,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
means that the element is an NP that serves as the subject of the sentence.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

"In addition to changing the encoding, we made some modifications to the scheme.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"First, analysis within the noun phrase is simplified.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Second, semantic division of adverbial phrases such as ??TMP?","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
(time) and ??MNR?,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
(manner) are not used: adverbial constituents other than ?ADVP?,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
(adverbial phrases) or ?PP?,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

"In our GTB scheme, ?NX?","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

(a certain kind of nominal modifier within a noun phrase) of the PTB scheme are not used.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
A noun phrase is gen erally left unstructured.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
This is mainly in order to simplify the process of annotation.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In case of biomedical abstracts, long noun phrases often involve multi-word technical terms whose syn tactic structure is difficult to determine without deep domain knowledge.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

Thus we have decided that we leave noun phrases unstructured in GTB annotation unless their analy sis is necessary for determining the structure outside the phrase.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
One of the exception is the cases that involves coordination where it is nec essary to explicitly mark up the coordinated constituents.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition, we have added special attributes ?TXTERR?, ?UNSURE?, and ?COMMENT?","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

The ?TXTERR?,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
is used when the annotator suspects that there is a grammatical error in the original text; the ?UNSURE?,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"

2.2 Annotation Process.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
The sentences in the titles and abstracts of the base text of GENIA corpus are annotated manu ally using an XML editor used for the Global Document Annotation project (Hasida 2000).,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Although the sentence boundaries were adopted from the corpus, the tree structure annotation was done independently of POS- and term- an notation already done on the GENIA corpus.","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
The annotator was a Japanese non-biologist who has previously involved in the POS annotation of the GENIA corpus and accustomed to the style of research abstracts in English.,"{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"Manually annotated abstracts are automatically converted to the PTB format, merged with the POS annota tion of the GENIA corpus (version 3.02).","{'title': 'Outline of the Corpus. ', 'number': '2'}"
"So far, 500 abstracts are annotated and converted to the merged PTB format.","{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
"In the merg ing process, we found several annotation errors.","{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
The 500 abstracts with correction of these errors are made publicly available as ?The GENIA Treebank Beta Version?,"{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
(GTB-beta).,"{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
"For further clean-up, we also tried to parse the corpus by the Enju parser (Miyao and Tsujii 2004), and identify the error of the corpus by investigating into the parse errors.","{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
Enju is an HPSG parser that can be trained with PTB-type corpora which is reported to have 87% accuracy on Wall Street Journal portion of Penn Treebank corpus.,"{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
"Currently the accuracy of the parser drops down to 82% on GTB-beta, and although proper quantitative analysis is yet to be done, it was found that the mismatches between labels of the treebank and the GENIA POS corpus (e.g. an ?ing form labeled as noun in the POS corpus and as the head of a verb phrase in the tree corpus) are a major source of parse error.","{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
The cor rection is complicated because several errors in the GENIA POS corpus were found in this cleaning-up process.,"{'title': 'Annotation Results. ', 'number': '3'}"
