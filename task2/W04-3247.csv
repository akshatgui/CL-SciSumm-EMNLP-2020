Multidocument extractive summarization relies on the concept of sentence centrality to identify the most important sentences in a document.,{}
Centrality is typically defined in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence.,{}
We are now considering an approach for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality (prestige) that we call LexPageRank.,{}
"In this model, a sentence connectivity matrix is constructed based on cosine similarity.",{}
"If the cosine similarity between two sentences exceeds a particular predefined threshold, a corresponding edge is added to the connectivity matrix.",{}
We provide an evaluation of our method on DUC 2004 data.,{}
The results show that our approach outperforms centroid-based summarization and is quite successful compared to other summarization systems.,{}
Text summarization is the process of automatically creating a compressed version of a given text that provides useful information for the user.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we focus on multi-document generic text summarization, where the goal is to produce a summary of multiple documents about the same, but unspecified topic.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Our summarization approach is to assess the centrality of each sentence in a cluster and include the most important ones in the summary.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"

Extractive summarization produces summaries by choosing a subset of the sentences in the original documents.,"{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
This process can be viewed as choosing the most central sentences in a (multi-document) cluster that give the necessary and enough amount of information related to the main theme of the cluster.,"{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
Centrality of a sentence is often defined in terms of the centrality of the words that it contains.,"{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
A common way of assessing word centrality is to look at the centroid.,"{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
The centroid of a cluster is a pseudodocument which consists of words that have frequency*IDF scores above a predefined threshold.,"{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
"In centroid-based summarization (Radev et al., 2000), the sentences that contain more words from the centroid of the cluster are considered as central.","{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
"Formally, the centroid score of a sentence is the cosine of the angle between the centroid vector of the whole cluster and the individual centroid of the sentence.","{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
This is a measure of how close the sentence is to the centroid of the cluster.,"{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
"Centroid-based summarization has given promising results in the past (Radev et al., 2001).","{'title': '2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization', 'number': '2'}"
"In this section, we propose a new method to measure sentence centrality based on prestige in social networks, which has also inspired many ideas in the computer networks and information retrieval.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
A cluster of documents can be viewed as a network of sentences that are related to each other.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
Some sentences are more similar to each other while some others may share only a little information with the rest of the sentences.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
We hypothesize that the sentences that are similar to many of the other sentences in a cluster are more central (or prestigious) to the topic.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
There are two points to clarify in this definition of centrality.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
First is how to define similarity between two sentences.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
Second is how to compute the overall prestige of a sentence given its similarity to other sentences.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"For the similarity metric, we use cosine.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
A cluster may be represented by a cosine similarity matrix where each entry in the matrix is the similarity between the corresponding sentence pair.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"Figure 1 shows a subset of a cluster used in DUC 2004, and the corresponding cosine similarity matrix.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
Sentence ID d s indicates the th sentence in the th document.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"In the following sections, we discuss two methods to compute sentence prestige using this matrix.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"In a cluster of related documents, many of the sentences are expected to be somewhat similar to each other since they are all about the same topic.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
This can be seen in Figure 1 where the majority of the values in the similarity matrix are nonzero.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"Since we are interested in significant similarities, we can eliminate some low values in this matrix by defining a threshold so that the cluster can be viewed as an (undirected) graph, where each sentence of the cluster is a node, and significantly similar sentences are connected to each other.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"Figure 2 shows the graphs that correspond to the adjacency matrix derived by assuming the pair of sentences that have a similarity above and , respectively, in Figure 1 are similar to each other.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
We define degree centrality as the degree of each node in the similarity graph.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"As seen in Table 1, the choice of cosine threshold dramatically influences the interpretation of centrality.","{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
Too low thresholds may mistakenly take weak similarities into consideration while too high thresholds may lose much of the similarity relations in a cluster.,"{'title': '3 Prestige-based sentence centrality', 'number': '3'}"
"When computing degree centrality, we have treated each edge as a vote to determine the overall prestige value of each node.","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
This is a totally democratic method where each vote counts the same.,"{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
"However, this may have a negative effect in the quality of the summaries in some cases where several unwanted sentences vote for each and raise their prestiges.","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
"As an extreme example, consider a noisy cluster where all the documents are related to each other, but only one of them is about a somewhat different topic.","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
"Obviously, we wouldn’t want any of the sentences in the unrelated document to be included in a generic summary of the cluster.","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
"However, assume that the unrelated document contains some sentences that are very prestigious considering only the votes in that document.","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
These sentences will get artificially high centrality scores by the local votes from a specific set of sentences.,"{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
This situation can be avoided by considering where the votes come from and taking the prestige of the voting node into account in weighting each vote.,"{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
Our approach is inspired by a similar idea used in computing web page prestiges.,"{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
"One of the most successful applications of prestige is PageRank (Page et al., 1998), the underlying technology behind the Google search engine.","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
PageRank is a method proposed for assigning a prestige score to each page in the Web independent of a specific query.,"{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
"In PageRank, the score of a page is determined depending on the number of pages that link to that page as well as the individual scores of the linking pages.","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"
"More formally, the PageRank of a page is given as follows: PR where are pages that link to , C is the number of outgoing links from page , and is the damping factor which can be set between and .","{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"

Another advantage is that it prevents unnaturally high IDF scores from boosting up the score of a sentence that is unrelated to the topic.,"{'title': 'ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3)', 'number': '4'}"

"For evaluation, we used the new automatic summary evaluation metric, ROUGE1, which was used for the first time in DUC 2004.","{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
ROUGE is a recallbased metric for fixed-length summaries which is based on n-gram co-occurence.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"

"Although it comes as a centroid-based summarization system by default, its feature set can be extended to implement other methods.","{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
The MEAD summarizer consists of three components.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
"During the first step, the feature extractor, each sentence in the input document (or cluster of documents) is converted into a feature vector using the user-defined features.","{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"

Reranker penalizes the sentences that are similar to the sentences already included in the summary so that a better information coverage is achieved.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
"Three default features that comes with the MEAD distribution are Centroid, Position and Length.","{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
"Position is the normalized value of the position of a sentence in the document such that the first sentence of a document gets the maximum Position value of 1, and the last sentence gets the value 0.","{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
"Length is not a real feature score, but a cutoff value that ignores the sentences shorter than the given threshold.","{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"

"Considering the relatively low complexity of degree centrality, it still serves as a plausible alternative when one needs a simple implementation.","{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
Computation of Degree can be done on the fly as a side product of LexPageRank just before the power method is applied on the similarity graph.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
Another interesting observation in the results is the effect of threshold.,"{'title': '4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data', 'number': '5'}"
