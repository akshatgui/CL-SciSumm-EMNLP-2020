"We present a novel method for extracting parallel sub-sentential fragments from comparable, non-parallel bilingual corpora.",{}
"By analyzing potentially similar sentence pairs using a signal processinginspired approach, we detect which segments of the source sentence are translated into segments in the target sentence, and which are not.",{}
"This method enables us to extract useful machine translation training data even from very non-parallel corpora, which contain no parallel sentence pairs.",{}
We evaluate the quality of the extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system.,{}
"Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the automatic creation of parallel corpora.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Several researchers (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Vogel, 2003; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Fung and Cheung, 2004a; Wu and Fung, 2005; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) have shown how fairly good-quality parallel sentence pairs can be automatically extracted from comparable corpora, and used to improve the performance of machine translation (MT) systems.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This work addresses a major bottleneck in the development of Statistical MT (SMT) systems: the lack of sufficiently large parallel corpora for most language pairs.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Since comparable corpora exist in large quantities and for many languages – tens of thousands of words of news describing the same events are produced daily – the ability to exploit them for parallel data acquisition is highly beneficial for the SMT field.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Comparable corpora exhibit various degrees of parallelism.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Fung and Cheung (2004a) describe corpora ranging from noisy parallel, to comparable, and finally to very non-parallel.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Corpora from the last category contain “... disparate, very nonparallel bilingual documents that could either be on the same topic (on-topic) or not”.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This is the kind of corpora that we are interested to exploit in the context of this paper.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Existing methods for exploiting comparable corpora look for parallel data at the sentence level.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, we believe that very non-parallel corpora have none or few good sentence pairs; most of their parallel data exists at the sub-sentential level.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"As an example, consider Figure 1, which presents two news articles from the English and Romanian editions of the BBC.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The articles report on the same event (the one-year anniversary of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution), have been published within 25 minutes of each other, and express overlapping content.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Although they are “on-topic”, these two documents are non-parallel.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In particular, they contain no parallel sentence pairs; methods designed to extract full parallel sentences will not find any useful data in them.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Still, as the lines and boxes from the figure show, some parallel fragments of data do exist; but they are present at the sub-sentential level.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"In this paper, we present a method for extracting such parallel fragments from comparable corpora.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Figure 2 illustrates our goals.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It shows two sentences belonging to the articles in Figure 1, and highlights and connects their parallel fragments.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Although the sentences share some common meaning, each of them has content which is not translated on the other side.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"The English phrase reports the BBC’s Helen Fawkes in Kiev, as well Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the ACL, pages 81–88, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics as the Romanian one De altfel, vorbind inaintea aniversarii have no translation correspondent, either in the other sentence or anywhere in the whole document.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"Since the sentence pair contains so much untranslated text, it is unlikely that any parallel sentence detection method would consider it useful.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"And, even if the sentences would be used for MT training, considering the amount of noise they contain, they might do more harm than good for the system’s performance.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The best way to make use of this sentence pair is to extract and use for training just the translated (highlighted) fragments.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
This is the aim of our work.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Identifying parallel subsentential fragments is a difficult task.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"It requires the ability to recognize translational equivalence in very noisy environments, namely sentence pairs that express different (although overlapping) content.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
"However, a good solution to this problem would have a strong impact on parallel data acquisition efforts.","{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
Enabling the exploitation of corpora that do not share parallel sentences would greatly increase the amount of comparable data that can be used for SMT.,"{'title': '1 Introduction', 'number': '1'}"
The high-level architecture of our parallel fragment extraction system is presented in Figure 3.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The first step of the pipeline identifies document pairs that are similar (and therefore more likely to contain parallel data), using the Lemur information retrieval toolkit' (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001); each document in the source language is translated word-for-word and turned into a query, which is run against the collection of target language documents.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
The top 20 results are retrieved and paired with the query document.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"We then take all sentence pairs from these document pairs and run them through the second step in the pipeline, the candidate selection filter.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
This step discards pairs which have very few words that are translations of each other.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"To all remaining sentence pairs we apply the fragment detection method (described in Section 2.3), which produces the output of the system.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"We use two probabilistic lexicons, learned automatically from the same initial parallel corpus.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The first one, GIZA-Ler, is obtained by running the GIZA++2 implementation of the IBM word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993) on the initial parallel corpus.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
One of the characteristics of this lexicon is that each source word is associated with many possible translations.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Although most of its high-probability entries are good translations, there are a lot of entries (of non-negligible probability) where the two words are at most related.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"As an example, in our GIZA-Ler lexicon, each source word has an average of 12 possible translations.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"This characteristic is useful for the first two stages of the extraction pipeline, which are not intended to be very precise.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Their purpose is to accept most of the existing parallel data, and not too much of the non-parallel data; using such a lexicon helps achieve this purpose.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"For the last stage, however, precision is paramount.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"We found empirically that when using GIZA-Ler, the incorrect correspondences that it contains seriously impact the quality of our results; we therefore need a cleaner lexicon.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"In addition, since we want to distinguish between source words that have a translation on the target side and words that do not, we also need a measure of the probability that two words are not translations of each other.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"All these are part of our second lexicon, LLR-Ler, which we present in detail in Section 2.2.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Subsequently, in Section 2.3, we present our algorithm for detecting parallel sub-sentential fragments.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Our method for computing the probabilistic translation lexicon LLR-Ler is based on the the LogLikelihood-Ratio (LLR) statistic (Dunning, 1993), which has also been used by Moore (2004a; 2004b) and Melamed (2000) as a measure of word association.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Generally speaking, this statistic gives a measure of the likelihood that two samples are not independent (i.e. generated by the same probability distribution).","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
We use it to estimate the independence of pairs of words which cooccur in our parallel corpus.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"If source word and target word are independent (i.e. they are not translations of each other), we would expect that .","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Thus, we can split the set of cooccurring word pairs into positively and negatively associated pairs, and obtain a measure for each of the two association types.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The first type of association will provide us with our (cleaner) lexicon, while the second will allow us to estimate probabilities of words not being translations of each other.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Before describing our new method more formally, we address the notion of word cooccurrence.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"In the work of Moore (2004a) and Melamed (2000), two words cooccur if they are present in a pair of aligned sentences in the parallel training corpus.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"However, most of the words from aligned sentences are actually unrelated; therefore, this is a rather weak notion of cooccurrence.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"We follow Resnik et. al (2001) and adopt a stronger definition, based not on sentence alignment but on word alignment: two words cooccur if they are linked together in the word-aligned parallel training corpus.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
We thus make use of the significant amount of knowledge brought in by the word alignment procedure.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"We compute ,the LLR score for words and , using the formula presented by Moore (2004b), which we do not repeat here due to lack of space.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"We then use these values to compute two conditional probability distributions: , the probability that source word trans, i.e. the distribution of given that is present is the same as the distribution of when is not present.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
The LLR statistic gives a measure of the likelihood of this hypothesis.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The LLR score of a word pair is low when these two distributions are very similar (i.e. the words are independent), and high otherwise (i.e. the words are strongly associated).","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"However, high LLR scores can indicate either a positive association (i.e. lates into target word , and , the probability that does not translate into .","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
We obtain the distributions by normalizing the LLR scores for each source word.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
The whole procedure follows: Word-align the parallel corpus.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Following Och and Ney (2003), we run GIZA++ in both directions, and then symmetrize the alignments using the refined heuristic.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"

Divide all terms by the corresponding normalizing factors to obtain .,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"In order to compute the distributions, we reverse the source and target languages and repeat the procedure.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"As we mentioned above, in GIZA-Lex the average number of possible translations for a source word is 12.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"In LLR-Lex that average is 5, which is a significant decrease.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Intuitively speaking, our method tries to distinguish between source fragments that have a translation on the target side, and fragments that do not.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"In Figure 4 we show the sentence pair from Figure 2, in which we have underlined those words of each sentence that have a translation in the other sentence, according to our lexicon LLR-Lex.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The phrases “to focus on the past year’s achievements, which,” and “sa se concentreze pe succesele anului trecut, care,” are mostly underlined (the lexicon is unaware of the fact that “achievements” and “succesele” are in fact translations of each other, because “succesele” is a morphologically inflected form which does not cooccur with “achievements” in our initial parallel corpus).","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The rest of the sentences are mostly not underlined, although we do have occasional connections, some correct and some wrong.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The best we can do in this case is to infer that these two phrases are parallel, and discard the rest.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Doing this gains us some new knowledge: the lexicon entry (achievements, succesele).","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
We need to quantify more precisely the notions of “mostly translated” and “mostly not translated”.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"

We want to retain the parts of the sentence where the signal is mostly positive.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"This can be achieved by applying a smoothing filter to the signal, and selecting those fragments of the sentence for which the corresponding filtered values are positive.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"The details of the procedure are presented below, and also illustrated in Figure 5.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"Let the Romanian sentence be the source sentence , and the English one be the target, .","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
We compute a word alignment by greedily linking each English word with its best translation candidate from the Romanian sentence.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"For each of the linked target words, the corresponding signal value is the probability of the link (there can be at most one link for each target word).","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"

"The circles indicate which fragments of the target sentence are selected by the procedure. translated; for this, we employ the distribution.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"

"If exists, we set the signal value for to ; otherwise, we set it to .","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
This is the initial signal.,"{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"We obtain the filtered signal by applying an averaging filter, which sets the value at each point to be the average of several values surrounding it.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"
"In our experiments, we use the surrounding 5 values, which produced good results on a development set.","{'title': '2 Finding Parallel Sub-Sentential Fragments in Comparable Corpora', 'number': '2'}"

We use two initial parallel corpora.,"{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
One is the training data for the Romanian-English word alignment task from the Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Corpora3 which has approximately 1M English words.,"{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"

"It is truly nonparallel; as our example from Figure 1 shows, even closely related documents have few or no parallel sentence pairs.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, we expect that our extraction method should perform best on this corpus.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"The other two sources are fairly similar, both in genre and in degree of parallelism, so we group them together and refer to them as the EZZ corpus.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"This corpus exhibits a higher degree of parallelism than the BBC one; in particular, it contains many article pairs which are literal translations of each other.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"Therefore, although our subsentence extraction method should produce useful data from this corpus, we expect the sentence extraction method to be more successful.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"

"In order to evaluate the importance of the LLRLex lexicon, we also performed fragment extraction experiments that do not use this lexicon, but only GIZA-Lex.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, for each initial parallel corpus and each comparable corpus, we extract three datasets: FragmentExtract, SentenceExtract, and Fragment-noLLR.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"The sizes of the extracted datasets, measured in million English tokens, are presented in Table 2.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
We evaluate our extracted corpora by measuring their impact on the performance of an SMT system.,"{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"

"In order to verify whether the fragment and sentence detection method complement each other, we also train a Fragment+Sentence system, on the initial corpus plus FragmentExtract and SentenceExtract.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
All MT systems are trained using a variant of the alignment template model of Och and Ney (2004).,"{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"All systems use the same 2 language models: one trained on 800 million English tokens, and one trained on the English side of all our parallel and comparable corpora.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
This ensures that differences in performance are caused only by differences in the parallel training data.,"{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"
"Our test data consists of news articles from the Time Bank corpus, which were translated into Romanian, and has 1000 sentences.","{'title': '3 Experiments', 'number': '3'}"

"The signal filtering function is very simple; more advanced filters might work better, and eliminate the need of applying additional heuristics (such as our requirement that the extracted fragments have at least 3 words).","{'title': '5 Conclusion', 'number': '5'}"
The fact that the source and target signal are filtered separately is also a weakness; a joint analysis should produce better results.,"{'title': '5 Conclusion', 'number': '5'}"
"Despite the better lexicon, the greatest source of errors is still related to false word correspondences, generally involving punctuation and very common, closed-class words.","{'title': '5 Conclusion', 'number': '5'}"
"Giving special attention to such cases should help get rid of these errors, and improve the precision of the method.","{'title': '5 Conclusion', 'number': '5'}"
