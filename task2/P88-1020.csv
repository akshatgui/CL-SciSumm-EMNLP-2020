"Of course, these additional requirements may only be included if such material can coherently follow the content of the nucleus or satellite.",{}
The question of ordering such additional constituents is still under investigation.,{}
The question of whether such additional material should be included at all is not addressed; the structurer tries to say everything it is given.,{}
"The structurer produces all coherent paragraphs (that is, coherent as defined by the relations) that satisfy the given goal(s) for any set of input elements.",{}
"For example, paragraph (b) is produced to the initial goal S H (SEQUENCE goal is produced by PEA, together with the appropriate representation ele- (ASK-I. in response to the does the system a program?.",{}
Different initial goals will result in different paragraphs.,{}
Each paragraph is represented as a tree in which branch points are RST relations and leaves are input elements.,{}

"It operates as follows: given one or more communicative goals, it finds RST relations whose intended effects match (some of) these goals; it then inspects which of the input elements match the nucleus and subgoal constraints for each relation.",{}
Unmatched constraints become subgoals which are posted on an agenda for the next level of planning.,{}
The tree can be expanded in either depth-first or breadth-first fashion.,{}
"Eventually, process bottoms out when either: (a) all input elements have been used and unsatisfied subgoals remain (in which case the structurer could request more input with desired properties from the encapsulating system); or (b) all goals are satisfied.",{}
"If more than one plan (i.e., paragraph tree structure) is produced, the results are ordered by preferring trees with the minimum unused number of input elements and the minimum number of remaining unsatisfied subgoals.",{}
The best tree is then traversed in left-to-right order; leaves provide input to Penman to be generated in English and relations at branch points provide typical interclausal relation words or phrases.,{}
In this way the structurer performs top-down goal refinement down to the level of the input elements. and Further Work This work is also being tested in a completely separate domain: the generation of text in a multimedia system that answers database queries.,{}
"Penman produces the following description of the ship Knox (where CTG 070.10 designates a group of ships): Knox is en route in rendezvous with CTG 070.10, arriving in Pearl Harbor on 4/24, for port visit until 4/30.",{}
"In this text, each clause (en route, rendezvous, arrive, visit) is a separate input element; the structurer linked them using the relations Sequence and Purpose (the same Purpose as shown above; it is signalled by &quot;in order to&quot;).",{}
"However, Penman can also be made to produce (d).",{}
Knox is en route in order to rendezvous with CTG 070.10.,{}
It will arrive in Pearl Harbor on 4/24.,{}
It will be on port visit until 4/30.,{}
The problem is clear: how should sentences in the paragraph be scoped?,{}
"At present, avoiding any claims about a theory, the structurer can feed 167 Penman either extreme: make everything one sentence, or make each input element a separate sentence.",{}
"However, neither extreme is satisfactory; as is clear from paragraph (b), &quot;short&quot; spans of text can be linked and &quot;long&quot; ones left separate.",{}
A simple way to implement this is to count the number of leaves under each branch (nucleus or satellite) in the paragraph structure tree.,{}
Another shortcoming is the treatment of input elements as indivisible entities.,{}
This shortcoming is a result of factoring out the problem of aggregation as a separate text planning task.,{}
"Chunking together input elements (to eliminate detail) or taking them apart (to be more detailed) has received scant mention — see Ellovy 871, and for the related problem of paraphrase see [Schank 75] — but this task should interact with text structuring in order to provide text that is both optimally detailed and coherent.",{}
"At the present time, only about 20% of the RST relations have been formalized to the extent that they can be used by the structurer.",{}
"This formalization process is difficult, because it goes handin-hand with the development of terms with which to characterize the relations' goals/constraints.",{}
Though the formalization can never be completely finalized — who can hope to represent something like motivation or justification complete with all ramifications?,{}
"— the hope is that, by having the requirements stated in rather basic terms, the relations will be easily adaptable to any new representation scheme and domain.",{}
"(It should be noted, of course, that, to be useful, these formalizations need only be as specific and as detailed as the domain model and representation requires.)",{}

The goal of this paper is to describe a method of planning paragraphs to be coherent while avoiding unintended spurious effects that result from the juxtaposition of unrelated pieces of text.,"{'title': '1 The Problem of Coherence', 'number': '1'}"
"This planning work, which can be called text structuring, must obviously be done before the actual generating of language can begin.","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
Text structuring is one of a number of pre-generation text planning tasks.,"{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
For some of the other tasks Penman has special-purpose domain-specific solutions.,"{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
They include: The problem of text coherence can be characterized in specific terms as follows.,"{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
"Assuming that input elements are sentence- or clause-sized chunks of representation, the permutation set of the input elements defines the space of possible paragraphs.","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
"A simplistic, brute-force way to achieve coherent text would be to search this space and pick out the coherent paragraphs.","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
This search would be factorially expensive.,"{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"

"However, by utilizing the constraints imposed by coherence, one can formulate operators that guide the search and significantly limit the search to a manageable size.","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
"In the example, the operators described below produced only 3 candidate paragraphs.","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
"Then, from this set of remaining candidates, the best paragraph can be found by applying a relatively simple evaluation metric.","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
"The contention of this paper is that, exercising proper care, the coherence relations that hold between successive pieces of text can be formulated as the abovementioned search operators and used in a hierarchical-expansion planner to limit the search and to produce structures describing the coherent paragraphs.","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"
"The illustrate this contention, the Penman text structurer is a simplified top-down planner (as described first by Pacerdoti 771).","{'title': '2 Text Structuring', 'number': '2'}"

The heart of the problem is obviously coherence.,"{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"
"Coherent text can be defined as text in which the hearer knows how each part of the text relates to the whole; i.e., (a) the hearer knows why it is said, and (b) the hearer can relate the semantics of each part to a single overarching framework.","{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"
"In 1978, Hobbs ((Hobbs 78, 79, 82]) recognized that in coherent text successive pieces of text are related in a specified set of ways.","{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"
"He produced a set of relations organized into four categories, which he postulated as the four types of phenomena that occur during conversation.","{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"
"His argument, unfortunately, contains a number of shortcomings; not only is the categorization not well-motivated, but the list of relations is incomplete.","{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"
"In her thesis work, McKeown took a different approach ([McKeown 82]).","{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"
She defined a set of relatively static schemas that represent the structure of stereotypical paragraphs for describing objects.,"{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"

"These relations, called RST (rhetorical structure theory), are used recursively; the assumption (never explicitly stated) is that a paragraph is only coherent if all its parts can eventually be made to fit into one overarching relation.","{'title': '3 Previous Approaches', 'number': '3'}"

"In formalizing these relations and using them generatively to plan paragraphs, rather than analytically to describe paragraph structure, a shift of focus is required.","{'title': '4 Formalizing RST Relations', 'number': '4'}"
Relations must be seen as plans — the operators that guide the search through the permutation space.,"{'title': '4 Formalizing RST Relations', 'number': '4'}"

"The effect field contains a description of the intended effect of the relation (i.e., the goal that the plan achieves, if properly executed).","{'title': '4 Formalizing RST Relations', 'number': '4'}"
"Since the goals in generation are communicative, the intended effect must be seen as the inferences that the speaker is licensed to make about the hearer's knowledge after the successful completion of the relation.","{'title': '4 Formalizing RST Relations', 'number': '4'}"

"For example, in (Cohen & Levesque 851, Cohen and Levesque present a proof that the indirect speech act of requesting can be derived from the following basic modal operators 'This is not strictly true; a small number of relations, such as Sequence, relate more than two pieces of text.","{'title': '4 Formalizing RST Relations', 'number': '4'}"
