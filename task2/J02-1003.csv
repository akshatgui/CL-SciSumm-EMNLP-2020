"Regardless of the type of knowledge base (KB) forming the input to the generator, many objects will not be designated in it via an ordinary proper name.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"A person like Mr. Jones, for example, may be designated using an artificial name like #Jones083, if the name Jones is not uniquely distinguishing.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The same is true for a piece of furniture, a tree, or an atomic particle, for instance, for which no proper name is in common use at all, or (in most cases) if the generator tries to refer to an entire set of objects.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In all such cases, the generator has to “invent” a description that enables the hearer to identify the intended referent.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In the case of Mr. Jones, for example, the program could identify him by providing his full name and address; in the case of a tree, some longer description may be necessary.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Henceforth, we will call the intended referent the target of the GRE algorithm.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The question that we set out to answer is whether existing GRE algorithms produce adequate descriptions whenever such descriptions exist: in short, whether these algorithms are, as we shall say, complete.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The paper brings a degree of formal precision to this issue and reveals a number of reasons why current GRE algorithms are incomplete; we sketch remedies and discuss their consequences in terms of linguistic coverage and computational tractability.,"{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We take the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995) to represent the state of the art in this area, and we minimize the deviations from this algorithm.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"As a result, this paper might be read as an investigation into how widely the ideas underlying the Incremental Algorithm can be used, and the extent to which they may be generalized.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"The main generalization that we will investigate involves complex Boolean combinations of properties, that is, descriptions that involve more than a merely intersective (i.e., logically conjunctive) combination of properties.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Such generalizations are natural because the properties involved are implicitly present in the KB, as we will explain; they become especially relevant when the algorithms are also generalized to generate references to sets, rather than individual objects.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"But, before we arrive at these generalizations, we will identify and confront a number of cases in which current GRE algorithms are incomplete even with respect to merely intersective descriptions.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In this paper, we will deal with “first mention” descriptions only (unlike Dale 1992, Chapter 5; Mittal et al. 1998; Kibble 1999), assuming that the information used for generating the description is limited to a KB containing complete information about which properties are true of each object.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Also, we focus on “one shot” descriptions, disregarding cases where an object is described through its relations with other objects (Dale and Haddock 1991; Horacek 1997; Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg 2001).","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"More crucially, we follow Dale and Reiter (1995) in focusing on the semantic content of a description (i.e., the problem of content determination, for short), assuming that any combination of properties can be expressed by the NLG module responsible for linguistic realization.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"This modular approach allows us to separate logical aspects of generation (which are largely language independent) from purely linguistic aspects, and it allows the realization module to base its decisions on complete information about which combination of properties is to be realized.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Accordingly, when we write Generation of Referring Expressions or GRE, we will refer specifically to determination of the semantic content of a description.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Analogously, the word description will refer to the semantic content of a linguistic expression only.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Note that our modular approach makes it unnatural to assume that a description is always expressed by a single noun phrase: if several sentences are needed, then so be it.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"After summarizing the Incremental Algorithm in Section 2, in Section 3 we take a closer look at the algorithm in its standard, “intersective” form, in which it identifies an object by intersecting a number of atomic properties.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"We discuss cases in which this algorithm fails to find an adequate description even though such a description exists, and we propose a number of possible remedies.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"Having extablished a completeness result for a version of the intersective Incremental Algorithm, we turn to questions of completeness that involve more complex Boolean combinations in Section 4.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
"In Section 5, we summarize the main results of our exploration and put them in perspective.","{'title': '1.', 'number': '2'}"
The Incremental Algorithm of Dale and Reiter (1995) singles out a target object from among some larger domain of entities.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
It does this by logically conjoining a number of properties found in a part of the KB that represents information shared between speaker and hearer.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The authors observed that the problem of finding a (“Full Brevity”) description that contains the minimum number of properties is computationally intractable (i.e., NP Hard).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"They combined this with the known fact that speakers often produce nonminimal descriptions anyway (e.g., Pechman 1989).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Accordingly, they proposed an algorithm that only approximates Full Brevity, while being of only linear complexity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Our summary of the algorithm glosses over many details, yet still allows us to discuss completeness.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In particular, we disregard any special provisions that might be made for the selection of head nouns because, arguably, this has to involve realizational issues.1 The Incremental Algorithm produces a set L of properties P1,.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"

", Pn such that their logical conjunction forms a “distinguishing description” (Dale 1989) of the target object r. In other words, writing [[Q]] for the extension of Q (i.e., the set of objects that have the property Q), the intersection [[P1]] n · · · n [[Pn]] must equal the singleton set {r}.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"It is a “hillclimbing” algorithm, which finds better and better approximations of the target set {r} by accumulating more and more properties—hence the term Incremental.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
There is no backtracking.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Consequently, if some property Pi in L is made redundant by later additions (i.e., when ([[P1]] n · · · n [[Pi − 1]] n [[Pi + 1]] n · · · n [[Pn]]) C [[Pi]]), then Pi is retained as a member of L nevertheless.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In the full algorithm (see below, D&RAtt), properties are analyzed as pairs consisting of an Attribute and a Value.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Attributes are ordered in a list A.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"If Ai precedes Aj in A, then Ai is “more preferred than” Aj; as a consequence, Ai will be considered before Aj by the algorithm.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Suppose r is the target object, and D (the “domain”) is the set of elements from which r is to be selected.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"The algorithm iterates through A; for each Attribute Ai, it checks whether specifying a Value for that Attribute would rule out at least one object that has not already been ruled out; if so, the Attribute is added to L, with a suitable Value (FindBestValue, below).","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"C is the set of “confusables” at any given stage of the algorithm.2 Objects that are ruled out are removed from C. The process of expanding L and contracting C continues until C = {r}; if and when this condition is met, L is a distinguishing set of properties.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For easy generalizability, the algorithm will be cast in set-theoretic terms.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We first present a version that focuses on properties, without separating these into Attributes and Values, and assume the properties themselves are ordered in a list P (cf.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Reiter and Dale 2000).,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"This version of the algorithm will be called D&RProp, or D&R when there is no risk of confusion.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We assume that the domain contains one or more objects other than the target object, the so-called distractors: thus, r E D but {r} =� D. Return Failure {All properties in P have been tested, and still C =� {r}} Assuming (as do Dale and Reiter [1995]) that the tests in the body of the loop take some constant amount of time, the worst-case running time is on the order of na (i.e., O(na)), where na is the total number of properties.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"So, the algorithm has only linear complexity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"A slightly closer approximation of Full Brevity can be achieved if Attributes and Values are separated (Dale and Reiter 1995), allowing the algorithm to choose the “best” Value for each Attribute.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Given an Attribute, FindBestValue selects the Value that removes most distractors while still including the target r. If no Value includes r, the function returns nil.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"In case of a tie (i.e., no Value removes more distractors than all others), FindBestValue chooses the least specific of the contestants.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, when dog rules out as many distractors as chihuahua, chihuahua cannot be chosen.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
A is the list of Attributes; L is the set of Attribute/Value combinations returned by the algorithm.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"A further notational convention will be useful: Values will be identified by two indices, the first of which identifies the Attribute.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Thus, to denote Value j of Attribute Ai, we write Vi,j.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
This version of the algorithm will be called D&RAtt.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
The initializations of L and D are omitted for brevity.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We will switch back and forth between D&R and D&RAtt, depending on what is at stake.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Like D&R, D&RAtt has linear complexity.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"This can be made precise in the following way.3 If the running time of a call of FindBestValue(r,Ai) is a constant times the number of Values of the Attribute Ai, then the worst-case running time of D&RAtt is O(nvna), where na equals the number of Attributes in the language and nv the average number of Values of all Attributes.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Some new definitions will be useful.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"A GRE algorithm is successful with respect to a given situation (i.e., with respect to a KB and a target) if it produces a distinguishing description of r in that situation.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
We will call an algorithm complete if it is successful in every situation in which a distinguishing description exists.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Success is not always possible: the properties in the KB may not be sufficient for individuating a given object.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Such no-win situations will not be held against an algorithm.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
The Incremental Algorithm generates descriptions that contain set intersection as their only Boolean operation.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We define a GRE algorithm to be intersectively complete if it has the following property: whenever an object can be characterized by intersecting a finite number of properties, the algorithm will find such an intersection.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"We would like to prove the Incremental Algorithm to be intersectively complete, but we will meet a few obstacles before we get there.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"One assumption without which the Incremental Algorithm cannot be proven to be intersectively complete concerns the semantic relation between different Values of a given Attribute: their extensions should not “overlap” in the following precise sense: van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions (If Vi,j and Vi,k do not overlap, then either [[Vi,j]]  [[Vi,k]], or [[Vi,k]]  [[Vi,j]], or [[Vi,j]] and [[Vi,k]] have an empty intersection.)","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Values can overlap for different reasons.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Some Attributes (e.g., COLOR) have “vague” Values (e.g., RED, ORANGE), which may be modeled as overlapping: some objects may count as both red and orange.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"Also, Values may derive from particular parts or aspects of an object; for example, if an object counts as METAL (PLASTIC) because it has some METAL (PLASTIC) parts, then it may be listed as both METAL and PLASTIC.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
Further examples arise if the KB models relations through unanalyzed properties.,"{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"
"For example, a desk, or a particular type of desk, can stand in a given relation (e.g., “being considered by” or “being bought by”) to more than one other company.","{'title': '2.', 'number': '3'}"

"The Value PHILIPS (being the BestValue of BOUGHT-BY, since it removes more distractors than the Value SONY) is chosen first, reducing the initial set C to {a, b, e}.","{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"
"Now, the algorithm is doomed to end in Failure, since the different Values of COLOR are unable to remove the unwanted b without also sacrificing a.","{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"

How can this limitation be remedied?,"{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"
"One might introduce a limited kind of backtracking, which “remembers” where the algorithm has encountered overlapping Values and, when it results in Failure, goes back to the last-encountered situation where it has made a choice between overlapping Values; if this does not lead to Success, the algorithm backtracks to the previous choice situation, and so on until no more choice situations are left (Failure) or a distinguishing description has been reached (Success).","{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"
"Unfortunately, this algorithm becomes intractable if Values overlap too often: in the worst case, we are back to having to check all combinations of properties.","{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"
A simpler and computationally more efficient algorithm would include all overlapping Values that are true of the target while also removing some distractors.,"{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"
"This could be done as follows: whenever a Value Vi,j of an Attribute Ai is selected for inclusion in L, search for other Values of the same Attribute that have the target r as an element; if such a Value Vi,k is found, check whether it stands in the subset relation to Vi,j (i.e., either [[Vi,j]]  [[Vi,k]] or [[Vi,k]]  [[Vi,j]]); if not, then include Vi,k as well; next, search for yet another Value Vi,l of the same Attribute that has r as an element, and include Vi,l if it does not stand in the subset relation to Vi,j or Vi,k; and so on until no other Values of Ai exist that have r as an element; then move on to the next Attribute.","{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"
"This algorithm has a worst-case running time of O(nan2v).4 In our example, this algorithm would produce a set consisting of the properties BOUGHT BY SONY and BOUGHT BY PHILIPS, which can be realized as the desk bought by Sony and by Philips; if we change the example by letting Philips buy c as well as a, the algorithm will go on to select the property BROWN, resulting in a set of properties that may be realized as the brown desk bought by Sony and by Philips.","{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"

"As long as the number of properties (i.e., Attribute/Value combinations) is denumerably infinite (Kleene 1971), only termination becomes problematic: if a uniquely referring description [[P1]] n · · · n [[Pn]] exists, then the algorithm will find one in finite time, since each of the n properties in the description will be found in finite time; if no distinguishing description exists, however, the algorithm never terminates.","{'title': 'BOUGHT-BY: PHILIPS ({a, b, e}), SONY ({a, c, d,f}) COLOR: BROWN ({a,b}), YELLOW ({c,d})', 'number': '4'}"

"But in fact, a description can contain much more than is logically necessary for identification, even beyond the redundancies allowed by the Incremental Algorithm.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Logically superfluous properties can, for example, be motivated by “overloading” if they serve communicative purposes other than identification (Pollack 1991; Dale and Reiter 1995, Section 2.4; Stone and Webber 1998; Jordan 1999).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"A description may also contain fewer properties than would be necessary for identification—for example, when no distinguishing description exists.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"A nondistinguishing description may take the form either of a definite description (as in John’s son, when John has several sons) or of an indefinite description (as in one of John’s sons; Horacek 1997; Stone and Webber 1998; Krahmer and Theune 1999).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"

Tractability.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
Computational tractability has also been paramount in our explorations.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"There is no agreement on the extent to which computational linguists should worry about the computational complexity of algorithms, or about the precise way in which complexity is most relevant (e.g., “typical” or worst-case complexity, cf. footnote 3).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Far from aiming to speak the last word on these issues, the material discussed here does shed some light on them.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"For example, even a fast algorithm can require a large number of calculations, in which case a solution may never be found; in the case of GRE, this happens when the set of distractors or the set of properties becomes extremely large (Section 3.2).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Conversely, a complex algorithm can be safe to use if the domain is small (or if key calculations can be performed offline; e.g., Bateman 1999).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"This may be achieved by putting a bound on the size of the search space, and this may be justifiable on empirical grounds (see the discussion of D&RBoolean in Section 4.3).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"One might, on the other hand, argue that bounding does not eliminate the disadvantages of an otherwise intractable algorithm, because the true nature of an algorithm is best revealed “by considering how it operates on unlimited cases” (Barton, Berwick, and Ristad 1987, Section 1.4.1).","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Be this as it may, we believe that complexity theory can offer valuable insights into the structure of GRE algorithms and that the growing attention to complexity in this area is a healthy development even if the practical implications are not always straightforward.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"Recent work also highlights an interesting mirror image of GRE complexity: a logically superfluous property may make it easier for the reader to find the referent. van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions An interesting class of cases is explored in Paraboni (2000), which focuses on descriptions of document parts.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
Consider the description the medicine depicted in Section 2.3.,"{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
"If Section 2 happens to contain only one figure, then the description the medicine depicted in Section 2 would have been logically sufficient, but this description would have made it necessary for the reader, in the worst case, to search through all of Section 2, making it less useful.","{'title': '5.', 'number': '6'}"
