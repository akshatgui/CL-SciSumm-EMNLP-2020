"Even though less than 2% of all dependenciesare non-projective, we still see an absolute improve ment of up to 1.1% in overall accuracy over the projective model.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
"Furthermore, when we focus on the subset of data that only contains sentences with at least one non-projective dependency, the effect is amplified.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
"Another major improvement here isthat the Chu-Liu-Edmonds non-projective MST al gorithm has a parsing complexity of O(n2), versusthe O(n3) complexity of the projective Eisner algo rithm, which in practice leads to improvements in parsing time.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
"The results also show that in terms of Accuracy, factored MIRA performs better than single-best MIRA.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"

We should note that the results in Collins et al (1999) are different then reported here due to different training and testing data sets.One concern raised in Section 2.2.1 is that search ing the entire space of non-projective trees couldcause problems for languages that are primarily projective.,"{'title': 'Experiments.

"However, as we can see, this is not a prob lem.","{'title': 'Experiments. ', 'number': '4'}"
